                   APPEAL from a
judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal (1993), 64 O.A.C. 70, 82 C.C.C. (3d)
527, allowing an appeal against convictions by Taliano J. and ordering a new
trial.  Appeal allowed.

 

                   Rick Libman, for the appellant.

 

                   Martin Kerbel, Q.C., for the respondent.

 

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered orally by

 

                   Sopinka J. ‑‑ In our opinion, the
majority of the Court of Appeal erred in directing a new trial.  It did so on
two grounds:

 

                   (1)non‑disclosure
of the information contained in the victim's impact statement;

 

                   (2)the
information in the impact statement was fresh evidence, which, if it had been
available at trial, might have affected the verdict.

 

                   With respect to
(1), we are of the opinion that although disclosure of the information ought to
have been made earlier counsel for the respondent failed to bring this to the
attention of the trial judge at the earliest opportunity as required.  In R.
v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, in referring to this obligation, we
stated at p. 341:

 

Failure
to do so by counsel for the defence will be an important factor in determining
on appeal whether a new trial should be ordered.

 

We agree with Labrosse J.A.,
dissenting, that the trial judge was still seized of the trial and had the
discretion to reopen the trial proceedings or to order a mistrial.

 

                   In this case,
counsel not only did not seek to bring the matter to the attention of the trial
judge but made a tactical decision not to have the information disclosed in the
sentencing proceedings.  In these circumstances, a new trial ought not to have
been ordered on this ground.

 

                   With respect to
(2), applying the factors in Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759,
in our opinion the proposed evidence ought not to have been admitted. 
Specifically, we are of the opinion that the respondent failed to satisfy the
criterion of due diligence.  While this factor is not applied strictly in
criminal cases and is not to be considered in isolation, the strength of the
other factors is not such that failure to satisfy the due diligence requirement
in this case is overborne by the other factors.

 

                   Accordingly, the
appeal is allowed and the judgment of the Court of Appeal is set aside.  The
matter is remitted to the Court of Appeal for determination of the respondent's
submission of alleged unreasonable verdict and the respondent's appeal against
sentence.

 

                   Judgment

on appeal from the court of appeal for
saskatchewan

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑

judge finding insufficient evidence to support charge ‑‑
Preliminary inquiry judge committing accused for trial on lesser included

(b), (2) , 566(1) , (2) , (3) , 568 ,  574(1) (a), (b), 576(1) , 577 (a), (b), (c),
(d).

 

                   Appellant elected
to be tried by judge alone on a charge of assault causing bodily harm
(s. 267(1) (b) of the Criminal Code ).  The judge presiding at
the preliminary inquiry found insufficient evidence to warrant committal on
that charge and committed him for trial on the lesser included offence of
common assault.  The prosecutor nevertheless preferred an indictment on the
original charge.  Appellant successfully brought a motion in the Court of
Queen's Bench to quash the indictment on the ground that he had been discharged
on the charge of assault causing bodily harm.  The Court of Appeal allowed the
Crown's appeal and remitted the matter to the Court of Queen's Bench for trial
on the indictment for assault causing bodily harm.  At issue here is whether a
prosecutor can prefer an indictment under s. 574(1) (b) for the
offence originally alleged in the information, even though the judge at the
preliminary inquiry has committed the accused on a lesser included offence
rather than on the original charge.

 

                   Held (L'Heureux‑Dubé J.
dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
Sopinka, Gonthier, Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  The preliminary inquiry judge
under s. 548 must commit an accused person for trial where there is
admissible evidence which, if believed, could result in a conviction.  He or
she is presumed to have considered the evidence as it related to that
particular offence and his or her refusal to commit on an offence charged in
the information amounts to a judicial determination that the charge is not
founded on the facts disclosed by the evidence.  

 

                   The preliminary
inquiry judge's power is not limited to committal or discharge so that the
specification of offences is left to the prosecutor.  Section 548(1)  must
be read with other sections including s. 548(2) .  If there is only one
charge, the options for the judge are to commit or discharge.  If there are
several, the judge must specify the charges on which he or she orders the
accused to stand trial (s. 548(2) ).  The prosecutor is empowered under
s. 574(1) (a) to prefer an indictment in respect of ""any charge
on which that person was ordered to stand trial"".

 

                   An accused who is
not committed to trial on a charge is no longer charged with that offence.  It
has been judicially determined that no evidence supports it.  The judge must
inquire into all the charges and make some disposition; a charge cannot be left
in limbo.  The appropriate disposition of charges for which there is
insufficient evidence to put the accused on trial is discharge of the accused
on these charges.  In order to proceed, a new charge must be laid, either by a
new information or preferred indictment.

 

                   The 1985 amendments
were not intended to make fundamental changes but rather were more in the
nature of codification of the following principles enunciated in McKibbon v.
The Queen.  The attorney general or anyone with the written consent of a
judge of the court may prefer an indictment for any offence irrespective of
whether a preliminary inquiry has been held, and if one has been held, whether
the accused was discharged or committed for that or any other offence.  The
prosecutor can prefer indictments if a preliminary inquiry has been held and
the accused has been committed for trial on at least one of the charges
inquired into by the judge.  The count of the indictment, however, must be for
an offence for which the accused was committed or for an offence disclosed in
the evidence introduced at the preliminary inquiry and which is not an offence
for which the accused was discharged.

 

                   Section 574
cannot be interpreted in isolation in order to avoid the potential problem with
the meaning of the term ""discharged"" in s. 577  (direct
indictments).  Statutory provisions should not be interpreted in isolation but
rather by reference to the statute as a whole and should be given an
interpretation that harmonizes provisions that bear on the same subject matter.

 

                   Section 574
applies not only to jury trials but also, by virtue of s. 566, to non‑jury
trials.  In jury trials it operates with s. 577  as a complete code with
respect to the prosecution's power to prefer indictments.  The same section
cannot have one meaning in its jury setting and another in its non‑jury
setting.  The words in s. 574 which make it subject to s. 577 , to
have any meaning, require that it be interpreted subject to the limitations
imposed by s. 577 .  The restriction on the language of s. 574 which is relevant
here is that an indictment cannot be preferred under that section if the
accused has been discharged.  The term ""discharged"" has been
interpreted as ""not committed on the charge laid"".  Section 574 must
be interpreted as subject to the restriction that an indictment cannot be
preferred under that section in a case in which the accused was not committed
on the charge laid.  This restriction applies notwithstanding the words
""in addition to or in substitution for any charge"" in s. 574(1) (b). 
The power of the prosecutor to prefer an indictment for an offence not charged
but which is based on facts disclosed in the evidence is preserved.

 

                   The prosecutor in a
non‑jury trial can accordingly prefer an indictment:  (1) on any
charge in respect of which the accused has been ordered to stand trial; or
(2) on any charge founded on facts disclosed in the evidence taken at the
preliminary inquiry, provided that it is not an offence charged and in respect
of which the accused was not ordered to stand trial.  In serious criminal
cases, the prosecutor can resort to s. 568  and order a jury trial. 
Section 577  then becomes available.  In other cases, the Crown may be able
to proceed by way of a new information.  The common law right to do so, while
removed by s. 577  in jury cases, has not been removed in non‑jury
cases.  Resort to this power may, however, constitute an abuse of process in
some circumstances.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé J.
(dissenting):  A preliminary inquiry is not a trial.  A justice at a
preliminary inquiry is to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to
commit the accused to trial.  The inquiry provides the accused with an
opportunity to avoid the indignity of being placed on trial where there is
simply insufficient evidence to justify the holding of a trial at all.  A
decision that the accused should be discharged is not appealable and can be
challenged only by way of certiorari.  At the same time, a discharge is
not a finding of ""not guilty"" and cannot form the basis of a plea of autrefois
acquit.

 

                   Section 548
authorizes a justice either to discharge the accused (s. 548(1) (b))
if no sufficient case is made out to put the accused on trial for the offence
charged or any other indictable offence in respect of the same transaction or
to order the accused to stand trial (s. 548(1) (a)) if there is
evidence supporting any indictable offence.  The only limitation in applying
s. 548(1) (a) is that the charge must be based on evidence disclosed
at the preliminary inquiry.

 

                   Once an accused has
elected to be tried by judge alone, the prosecutor is limited to the power of
ordinary indictment in s. 574 which requires that the indictment be
preferred only if the accused has been committed to stand trial after a
preliminary inquiry.  Where the justice and the prosecutor have differing
views, s. 574(1) (b) gives the prosecutor the authority to go beyond
the charges selected by the justice and add or substitute charges.  This power
is very broad; the only explicit limitation is that the charge must be one
which is founded on the facts disclosed by the evidence taken on the
preliminary inquiry.  Section 548, which authorizes a preliminary inquiry
justice to discharge an accused or to commit him or her to trial on the basis
of the evidence at the inquiry, does not limit the scope of s. 574.  The
argument that a preliminary inquiry justice has made a finding mischaracterizes
his or her role and the rationale underlying s. 574.  Under the current
s. 548, any charge must be founded on evidence disclosed at the
preliminary inquiry.  If it is not, the opinion of the preliminary inquiry
justice that it is, is simply irrelevant.

 

                   Where an accused
has elected to be tried by judge alone, and where a justice commits the accused
to stand trial, s. 574(1) (b) allows the Crown to prefer an
indictment on any charge founded on the evidence given at the preliminary
inquiry, regardless of the opinion of the justice as to that specific offence. 
Such an indictment may be quashed if the charge is not founded on the facts
disclosed at the preliminary inquiry.  This is not a question of asking whether
the prosecutor incorrectly ""over‑ruled"" the justice, or whether
the prosecutor should have deferred to the opinion of the justice.  Because of
the enactment of s. 566 , s. 577  has no application here.  The meaning
of ""discharged"" in s. 577  was not relevant to the interpretation of
s. 574 which was clear and unambiguous.  The policy considerations behind the
different procedures applying to the ordinary and to the direct powers of
indictment support this interpretation.

 

                   At the preliminary
inquiry, there was sufficient evidence to justify the preferring of an
indictment on the charge of assault causing bodily harm.

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and La Forest, Sopinka, Gonthier, Iacobucci and Major JJ. was
delivered by

 

                   Sopinka
J. -- This appeal
concerns an issue relating to the respective roles of the prosecutor and the
judge conducting a preliminary inquiry (hereinafter ""the preliminary
judge"" or ""the judge"").  Specifically, the Court must decide
whether a prosecutor can prefer an indictment with respect to an offence
charged in an information which the preliminary judge has found is not
supported by sufficient evidence to order the accused to stand trial.

 

I.  Facts

 

                   The appellant was
charged with assault causing bodily harm under s. 267(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  He elected to be tried by judge alone. 
Following a preliminary inquiry before a provincial court judge, he was
committed for trial on the lesser included offence of common assault.  The
presiding judge found there was insufficient evidence to warrant committal on
the original charge.

 

                   The prosecutor
nevertheless preferred an indictment against the appellant on the original
charge of assault causing bodily harm.  The appellant brought a motion to quash
the indictment on the ground that he had been discharged on the charge of
assault causing bodily harm.  The motion was granted at the Court of Queen's
Bench and the prosecutor's indictment was quashed.  The Crown's appeal to the
Court of Appeal was allowed and the matter was remitted to the Court of Queen's
Bench for trial on the indictment for assault causing bodily harm.

 

II.  Judgments Below

 

Provincial Court of
Saskatchewan

 

                   Meagher Prov. Ct.
J. stated:  ""I don't see any evidence that I could commit on bodily harm,
but certainly there is adequate evidence of common assault"".  He therefore
committed the appellant on the included offence of common assault only.

 

Court of Queen's Bench of Saskatchewan

 

                   McIntyre J.
reviewed the relevant statutory provisions and case law with respect to the
preferring of indictments.  He rejected the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of
Appeal in R. v. Hampton (1990), 69 Man. R. (2d) 293, and followed the
decisions in R. v. Hill (1987), 57 Sask. R. 234 (Q.B.), and R. v.
Myers (1991), 65 C.C.C. (3d) 135 (Nfld. C.A.), which decided that committal
on a lesser charge constituted a discharge of the accused under ss. 548(1)(b)
and 577(b) of the Code.  McIntyre J. added:

 

                   If
the agent of the Attorney General is permitted to second guess a judge hearing
the preliminary inquiry on this point, then there would be no need whatever of
ss. 577 (b) and (c) of the Criminal Code .

 

He concluded that the appellant had been
discharged and therefore, in order for the Crown to prefer an indictment
containing a charge of assault causing bodily harm it had to proceed under the
heading of a ""direct indictment"" pursuant to ss. 577 (b)
and (c) and obtain the written personal consent of the Attorney General
or Deputy Attorney General.

 

Court of Appeal for
Saskatchewan (1992),
97 Sask. R. 245 (Tallis J.A. for the Court)

 

                   Tallis J.A. relied
on R. v. Hampton, supra, as the primary authority on whether s. 574
authorizes a Crown prosecutor to prefer an indictment for an offence following
a preliminary hearing on an information alleging the same offence, where the
accused is committed only on a lesser, included offence.  In Hampton,
the Manitoba Court of Appeal affirmed the right of the prosecutor to invoke s.
574 of the Code in similar circumstances.  Given that the Supreme Court
of Canada denied leave to appeal (indexed as D.K.H. v. The Queen, [1991]
1 S.C.R. viii), he found it appropriate to follow Hampton and disregard
other authorities on point.  Tallis J.A. stated at p. 246:  ""we do not
think the committal on the lesser charge of common assault constituted a
discharge under s. 548(1) (b) and 577 (b).""

 

III.  Analysis

 

                   Part
XIX of the Code governs procedure in indictable offences where the
accused has elected to be tried by judge alone.  The prosecutor's authority to
prefer an indictment is found at s. 566, which states:

 

                   566. (1) The trial of an accused for an
indictable offence, other than a trial before a provincial court judge, shall
be on an indictment in writing setting forth the offence with which he is
charged.

 

                   (2)
Where an accused elects under section 536 or re-elects under section 561 to be
tried by a judge without a jury, an indictment in Form 4 may be preferred.

 

                   (3)
Section 574  and subsection 576(1)  apply, with such modifications as the
circumstances require, and section 577  does not apply, to the preferring of an
indictment pursuant to subsection (2). 

 

                   Section 566(3) 
referentially incorporates ss. 574  and 576(1)  from Part XX
(""Procedure in Jury Trials and General Provisions"").  These
provisions state in part:

 

                   574. (1)  Subject to subsection (3) and
section 577 , the prosecutor may prefer an indictment against any person who has
been ordered to stand trial in respect of 

 

(a)
any charge on which that person was ordered to stand trial, or

 

(b)
any charge founded on the facts disclosed by the evidence taken on the
preliminary inquiry, in addition to or in substitution for any charge on which
that person was ordered to stand trial,

 

whether
or not the charges were included in one information.

 

                   576. (1)  Except as provided in this Act,
no indictment shall be preferred.

 

                   Section 574 is the
provision which authorizes the prosecutor to prefer an indictment in the
ordinary course of events.  Under this section no special consent is required. 
This can be contrasted with s. 577  which provides for the preferring of
""direct"" indictments.  Section 566 unequivocally states that
s. 577  does not apply to judge alone proceedings.  Section 577  states:

 

                   577.
 In any prosecution, 

 

(a)
where a preliminary inquiry has not been held, an indictment shall not be
preferred, or

 

(b)
where a preliminary inquiry has been held and the accused has been discharged,
an indictment shall not be preferred or a new information shall not be laid

 

before
any court without,

 

(c)
where the prosecution is conducted by the Attorney General or the Attorney
General intervenes in the prosecution, the personal consent in writing of the
Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General, or

 

(d)
where the prosecution is conducted by a prosecutor other than the Attorney
General and the Attorney General does not intervene in the prosecution, the
written order of a judge of that court.

 

                   The crux of this
appeal concerns the meaning of s. 574(1) (b), which states that the
prosecutor may prefer an indictment on ""any charge founded on the facts
disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry"". 
Specifically, the issue in this case is whether the prosecutor can prefer an
indictment under s. 574(1) (b) for the offence originally alleged in the information,
even though the preliminary judge has not committed the accused to stand trial
on the original charge, committing only on a lesser, included offence.  This
requires an examination of the judge's powers and duties at the preliminary
inquiry.

 

                   The relevant
section is s. 548, which states:

 

                   548. (1)  When all the evidence has been
taken by the justice, he shall

 

(a)
if in his opinion there is sufficient evidence to put the accused on trial for
the offence charged or any other indictable offence in respect of the same
transaction, order the accused to stand trial; or

 

(b)
discharge the accused, if in his opinion on the whole of the evidence no
sufficient case is made out to put the accused on trial for the offence charged
or any other indictable offence in respect of the same transaction.

 

                   (2)  Where the justice orders
the accused to stand trial for an indictable offence, other than or in addition
to the one with which the accused was charged, the justice shall endorse on the
information the charges on which he orders the accused to stand trial.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   In United States
of America v. Shephard, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067, Ritchie J. (for the majority)
stated at p. 1080:

 

                   I
agree that the duty imposed upon a ""justice"" under s. 475(1) [now s.
548(1) ] is the same as that which governs a trial judge sitting with a jury in
deciding whether the evidence is ""sufficient"" to justify him in
withdrawing the case from the jury and this is to be determined according to
whether or not there is any evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly
instructed could return a verdict of guilty.  The ""justice"", in
accordance with this principle, is, in my opinion, required to commit an
accused person for trial in any case in which there is admissible evidence
which could, if it were believed, result in a conviction.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   As Shephard
emphasizes, the preliminary judge has no discretion in making this decision. 
If there is any evidence, s. 548 expressly states that the preliminary judge
has a duty to commit the accused to stand trial.  When the accused is not
committed on an offence specifically charged in the information, it must be
presumed that the judge has turned his or her mind to the evidence as it
relates to that particular offence.  Once the judge has heard all of the
evidence, his or her refusal to commit on an offence charged in the information
amounts to a judicial determination that the charge is not ""founded on the
facts disclosed by the evidence"". 

 

                   In these
circumstances we must determine whether Parliament intended that counsel for
the Attorney General could prefer an indictment in respect of the very charge
which the judge has decided is not supported by the evidence.

 

                          The
submission of the Crown in the affirmative, which my colleague accepts, is
based on a view of the respective roles of the preliminary judge and the
prosecutor developed in Hampton, supra.  In that case, Helper
J.A., at p. 302, stated:  

 

The
exercise of that administrative discretion by the prosecutor does not result in
a collateral attack upon the decision of the magistrate whose only power is to
commit for trial or to discharge the accused from the court process.  

 

                          I
respectfully disagree with the view that the power of the preliminary judge is
limited to committal or discharge and that the specification of offences is
left to the prosecutor.  While one might get this impression in reading
s. 548(1)  in isolation it is clear from other sections including
s. 548(2)  that this interpretation cannot be sustained.  If there is only
one charge, the options for the judge are to commit or discharge.  If there are
several charges either because several are laid or emerge from the evidence at
the hearing the judge must specify ""the charges on which he orders the
accused to stand trial"" (s. 548(2) ).  Moreover, under s. 574(1) (a)
the prosecutor is empowered to prefer an indictment in respect of ""any
charge on which that person was ordered to stand trial"".

 

                          If an
accused is not committed to stand trial with respect to a charge in the
information, what is its status?  Clearly the accused is no longer charged with
that offence.  There has been a judicial determination that there is no
evidence to support it so as to permit the Crown to proceed to trial.  In order
to proceed with the charge a new charge would have to be laid either by a new
information or a preferred indictment.  In requiring the judge to specify the
charges in respect of which the accused is ordered to stand trial, it follows
that with respect to other charges in the information the disposition is that
the accused is discharged.  Since the judge has a duty to inquire into all
charges, surely the judge must make some disposition of all charges.  A charge
cannot simply be left in limbo.  The appropriate disposition of charges for
which there is insufficient evidence to put the accused on trial is discharge
of the accused on those charges.

 

                          This view of
the matter has been current since at least 1969 when Fraser J. in R. v.
Miller, [1970] 3 C.C.C. 89 (Ont. H.C.), quashed an indictment which
purported to reinstitute a charge in respect of which the preliminary judge
refused to commit.  The accused had been charged with criminal negligence
causing death.  At the preliminary hearing the judge committed for dangerous
driving and, in the words of Fraser J. at p. 90, ""discharged him [the
accused] with respect to the offence of causing death by criminal
negligence"".  At page 95, Fraser J. continued:  

 

                   Having
regard to its context I am of the view that s. 486(b) is intended to be
applied and used as it has been in the past; i.e., to enable a
prosecutor to revise or add counts based on the evidence at the preliminary
hearings as to an occurrence which has been fully investigated.  It is not
intended to enable him to reverse a decision made at the preliminary hearing.  

 

This view of the powers of the
prosecutor was affirmed by the Quebec Court of Appeal in St. Jean v. The
Queen (1978), 7 C.R. (3d) 14.  It was further affirmed by this Court in McKibbon
v. The Queen, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 131, which dealt with the relevant provisions
of the Code prior to the 1985 amendments to which my colleague refers. 
In McKibbon, the accused was charged with two counts in an information
and elected trial by jury.  He was committed to stand trial on the two counts
in the information but the prosecutor preferred an indictment adding two counts
which were not in the information but were allegedly based on the facts
elicited at the preliminary hearing.  The preliminary judge acting on this
Court's decision in R. v. Chabot, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 985, refused to commit
the accused to stand trial on the additional counts.  In Chabot the
Court held that a preliminary judge had no power to commit for an offence not
charged but disclosed in the evidence taken at the hearing.  Lamer J. (as he
then was), speaking for the majority in McKibbon, held that the
prosecutor was empowered to prefer an indictment adding the two charges.  After
an exhaustive review of the history of the provisions relating to the
preferment of indictments, he summarized the then current powers as follows at
p. 157:

 

1. 
The Attorney General or anyone with the written consent of a judge of the court
may prefer an indictment for any offence irrespective of whether a preliminary
inquiry has been held, and if so, whether the accused was discharged or committed
for that or any other offence.

 

2. 
Anyone else empowered under s. 507(2) to prefer indictments can do so only if
the following conditions have been met:

 

                          1) A
preliminary inquiry has been held;

 

                   2)The
accused has been committed for trial on at least one of the charges inquired
into by the justice;

 

                          3) The count
of the indictment must be for

 

                               a)an
offence for which the accused was committed, or

 

                          b) for
an offence disclosed in the evidence introduced at the preliminary inquiry, and
which is not an offence for which the accused was discharged.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

                          My colleague
is of the view that McKibbon is inapplicable for two reasons:

 

                          (1)  the
1985 amendments have changed the powers of the prosecutor to prefer
indictments; and

 

                          (2)  this
Court in McKibbon was required to consider the relationship between ss.
574  and 577  while this is unnecessary in this case.  This relieves the Court in
this case of having to assign a meaning to the term ""discharged"" in
s. 577  which would affect the interpretation of s. 574.  

 

                          With respect
to the first reason, I agree with the reasoning of Baudouin J.A. in Canada
(Procureur général) v. Bélair (1991), 10 C.R. (4th) 209, to the effect that
the 1985 amendments were not intended to make fundamental changes but rather
were more in the nature of codification of the principles in McKibbon
with respect to the power of the prosecutor to prefer indictments.  At page
221, Baudouin J.A. states: 

 

                   [translation]  In view of,
first, this historical perspective, and second, the presumed intent of the
legislature, I am persuaded from an analysis of the 1985 amendments that the
legislative intent in 1985 was not to fundamentally alter the Attorney
General's powers to prefer indictments.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

                   Furthermore,
it seems to me that the legislature intended, in a different form and with a
number of other ad hoc amendments, to reproduce the earlier law
regarding the Attorney General's powers.  To begin with, s. 574(1)  Crim.
C., which provides that a prosecutor may prefer an indictment against an
accused ordered to stand trial in respect of any charge on which he or she was
ordered to stand trial or any charge founded on facts disclosed by evidence
taken on the preliminary inquiry, whether or not the charges were included in
one information, restates the provisions of the old s. 504 Crim. C. 
It codifies the interpretation given by the Supreme Court in McKibbon v. R.,
supra, to the old ss. 505(1) and 507(2) Crim. C.  [Emphasis
in original.]

 

 

                   With respect to the
second point, I do not see how the reasoning in  Hampton can be espoused
without deciding whether the accused was discharged in relation to the offence
for which the indictment was preferred.  The premise on which the Hampton
decision is based is that the preferment involves no collateral attack on the
decision of the judge because ""discharge"" means complete discharge
""from the court process,"" to quote in part from Hampton, at p.
302.  If a decision not to commit on a specific charge is a discharge, then the
decision of the prosecutor to charge is a collateral attack on the decision of
the judge and the premise of Hampton is erroneous. 

 

                          Furthermore,
I do not agree that s. 574 can be interpreted in isolation in order to avoid
the potential problem with the meaning of the term ""discharged"" in
s. 577 .  It is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that the
provisions of a statute should be interpreted not in isolation but by reference
to the statute as a whole.  An interpretation should be adopted that as far as
possible harmonizes provisions that bear on the same subject matter.  In R.
v. Compagnie Immobilière BCN Ltée, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 865, Pratte J.,
writing for the Court, stated, at p. 872:

 

                   One
of the most important rules to be followed in the interpretation of a
particular provision of a statute was expressed as follows by Lord Herschell in
Colquhoun v. Brooks (1889), 14 A.C. 493, at p. 506:

 

                          It
is beyond dispute, too, that we are entitled and indeed bound when construing
the terms of any provision found in a statute to consider any other parts of
the Act which throw light upon the intention of the legislature and which may
serve to shew that the particular provision ought not to be construed as it
would be if considered alone and apart from the rest of the Act.

 

                   And,
in Canada Sugar Refining Company, Limited v. The Queen, [1898] A.C. 735,
Lord Davey said at p. 741:

 

                   ... Every clause of a
statute should be construed with reference to the context and the other clauses
of the Act, so as, so far as possible, to make a consistent enactment of the
whole statute or series of statutes relating to the subject-matter.

 

                   Clearly,
this basic rule of statutory construction is still in effect....  [Emphasis
added.]

 

                   Section 574 applies
to both jury trials and non-jury trials.  In jury trials both ss. 574  and
577  are operative to provide a complete code with respect to the powers of the
prosecutor to prefer indictments.  Section 566 makes s. 574 applicable to
non-jury trials, the latter section being ""[s]ubject to  . . .  section
577 "".  Surely the same section cannot have one meaning in its jury setting
and another in its non-jury setting.  I would come to this conclusion even in
the absence of the express language in s. 574 which makes it subject to
s. 577 .  If specific language in s. 577  confers a power to be exercised
only by the Attorney General or his or her deputy in cases to be tried by a
jury, it would be difficult to suggest that by the use of general language in
s. 574 Parliament intended to confer the same power on agents of the Attorney
General in non-jury cases.  Notwithstanding the contradictory effect of s. 566,
I am of the opinion that the use of the words ""[s]ubject to . . . section
577 "" in s. 574 reinforces this conclusion. 

 

                          It is
difficult to reconcile the conflicting wording of s. 566 which both
incorporates by reference s. 574 and provides that s. 577  does not
apply in non-jury trials.  In my opinion, the peremptory language of
s. 566 clearly expresses the intention of Parliament that the additional
powers conferred by s. 577  on the Attorney General and his or her deputy
are not to apply in non-jury trials.  In trials by jury, that section operates
both to enlarge the powers of a prosecutor and limit the ambit of the language
in s. 574.  The enlarged powers can only be exercised with the written consent
of the Attorney General or his or her deputy.  The enlarged powers relate to
preferring indictments:  (1) when no preliminary hearing has been held, and (2)
when a preliminary hearing has been held and the accused has been discharged,
whether or not the indictment is based on facts disclosed in the evidence at
the preliminary hearing.  This latter power is clearly intended to permit the
Attorney General or deputy to overrule the discharge by a judge at a
preliminary inquiry.  The restriction on the language of s. 574 which is
relevant here is that an indictment cannot be preferred under that section if
the accused has been discharged.  The words in s. 574 which make it
subject to s. 577 , if they are to have any meaning, require that it be
interpreted subject to the limitations imposed by s. 577 .

 

                          In respect
of jury trials the crown successfully argued in R. v. Myers, supra,
that in circumstances similar to this case an indictment could be preferred
under s. 577  in respect of the charge laid when the preliminary judge
ordered the accused to stand trial only on an included lesser offence.  The
accused was charged with sexual assault and was committed to stand trial on
simple assault.  The prosecutor preferred an indictment under s. 577  and
his power to do so was upheld by the Court of Appeal.  This result was reached
by interpreting the term ""discharged"" in s. 577  as ""not
committed on the charge laid"" (p. 140).  I agree with this
conclusion.  Applying it to the circumstances of this case, s. 574 must be
interpreted as subject to the restriction that an indictment cannot be
preferred under that section in a case in which the accused was ""not
committed on the charge laid"".  

 

                          This
restriction applies notwithstanding the words ""in addition to or in
substitution for any charge"" which appear in s. 574(1) (b).  They do
not extend to permit the addition or substitution of a charge for which the
accused was discharged.  On the other hand, the power of the prosecutor to
prefer an indictment for an offence not charged but which is based on
facts disclosed in the evidence is preserved.  This is a power which the
prosecutor had before the 1985 amendments when a similar power was first given
to a preliminary judge.  See R. v. Chabot, supra, and McKibbon
v. The Queen, supra.  It was not the intention of Parliament to
remove this power from the prosecutor in giving it to the judge. 

 

                          To
summarize, the prosecutor in a proceeding governed by Part XIX of the Code
relating to ""Indictable Offences _ Trial Without Jury"" has
the following power to prefer an indictment:

 

                          (1) an
indictment may be preferred on any charge in respect of which the accused has
been ordered to stand trial;

 

                          (2) an
indictment may be preferred in respect of any charge founded on facts disclosed
in the evidence taken at the preliminary hearing, provided that it is not an
offence charged and in respect of which the accused was not ordered to stand
trial. 

 

                          While it
might be desirable that the prosecutor have the benefit of the powers conferred
by s. 577  subject to its special conditions, it apparently was Parliament's
intention not to provide such powers in non-jury trials.  This is the
inevitable conclusion to be drawn from the language of s. 566.  This is
consistent with Parliament's policy to restrict the powers of the prosecutor to
prefer indictments in non-jury cases.  See McKibbon, supra, at
pp. 148-49.  Parliament can, of course, confer this power by amending the Code
if it is thought desirable.  Meanwhile, in serious criminal cases, the
prosecutor can avail him- or herself of the power contained in s. 568 of the Code
and order a jury trial, in which case s. 577  becomes available.  In other
cases, the Crown may be able to proceed by way of a new information.  The
common law right to do so, while removed by s. 577  in jury cases, has not been
removed in non-jury cases.  Resort to this power may, however, constitute in
some circumstances an abuse of process.  See R. v. Hamm, [1984] 5 W.W.R.
696.

 

                          It follows
from the above that the prosecutor in this case had no power to prefer an
indictment in respect of assault occasioning bodily harm.  Accordingly, the
appeal is allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is set aside and the
judgment of McIntyre J. is restored.

 

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by 

 

                   L'Heureux-Dubé
J. (dissenting) -- This
case concerns a narrow and technical point of criminal procedural law:  that
is, the scope of the powers of indictment contained in s. 574(1) (b) of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (the ""Code ""). 

 

Facts

 

                   A dance was held at
the Core Ritchie Centre in Regina, Saskatchewan on November 10, 1989.  Joe
Francis, initially a co-accused in this case, got into a fight early in the
evening, left the dance, and then returned with a group of friends, none of
whom had tickets.  One of these friends was the appellant, Mr. Tapaquon.  The
group pushed and shoved their way in through an unlocked door and into a boot
rack area.  Fighting broke out between this group, and those people who had
been policing the door to prevent entry by those without tickets.  One of these
people, David Wood, was knocked unconscious, and suffered a broken nose, broken
tooth, and other injuries.  

 

                   The appellant was
charged with assault causing bodily harm under s. 267(1) (b) of the Code ,
and elected to be tried by judge alone.  At the preliminary inquiry, the judge
concluded that there was insufficient evidence of assault causing bodily harm,
but committed the appellant to stand trial on the lesser included offence of
common assault.  The Crown, however, preferred an indictment on the original
charge of assault causing bodily harm.  The appellant then brought a motion to
quash the indictment, arguing that he had been discharged on the charge of
assault causing bodily harm.  This motion was granted by the Court of Queen's
Bench and the indictment was quashed.  The respondent Crown brought an appeal
to set aside the quashing of its indictment.  The Court of Appeal allowed the
appeal, and the matter was remitted back to the Court of Queen's Bench for
trial on the charge of assault causing bodily harm.  The appellant now appeals
that decision.

Judgments

 

Provincial Court of Saskatchewan (Meagher Prov. Ct. J.)

 

                   Meagher Prov. Ct.
J. gave the following reasons orally for committing the appellant on a charge
of common assault instead of the original charge of assault causing bodily
harm:

 

Well,
I don't see any evidence at all of -- there was a malie [sic] of a dozen
or so people and any -- and there is evidence that he landed I think that would
be about a total of three blows to Wood's face.  But that wasn't -- had nothing
to do with which one would conclude the injuries were.  That three individuals
were kicking him in the body and the head.  And as I say, any more than I would
think that charges could be laid against the other dozen or several people
anyway that were pushing to get into that and involved in the malie [sic]
as it might be called.

  

                   I
don't see any evidence that I could commit on bodily harm, but certainly there
is adequate evidence of common assault.  And I do commit the accused to stand
trial at the next regular sittings of the Court of Queen's Bench, judge without
a jury, on the charge of -- included charge of common assault.

 

Court of Queen's Bench of Saskatchewan (McIntyre J.)

 

                   McIntyre J.
reviewed ss. 248 , 574  and 577  of the Code , and the case law dealing with
the preferring of indictments.  He expressed concern that, if he accepted the
Crown's submissions, prosecutors would be able to lay charges even where a
judge had made a specific finding that there was insufficient evidence to
commit an accused on that charge.  Not considering himself bound by the case
law from other provinces, McIntyre J. chose to follow the decision of his own
court in R. v. Hill (1987), 57 Sask. R. 234 .  In that case, Maher J.
concluded that, under ss. 548(1) (b) and 577 (b) of the Code ,
committal for trial on the included offence of manslaughter constitutes a
discharge on the charge of second degree murder.  Based on this approach,
McIntyre J. found that the accused had been discharged on the charge of assault
causing bodily harm, and so quashed that charge.  He commented that prosecutors
should not be ""permitted to second guess a judge hearing the preliminary
inquiry"".  In his view, in order to prefer an indictment containing a
charge of assault causing bodily harm, the Crown would have to prefer a direct
indictment pursuant to s. 577 (b) and (c), and obtain the written
personal consent of the Attorney General.

 

Court of Appeal (1992), 97 Sask. R. 245 (Tallis J.A.
orally; Cameron and Jackson JJ.A. concurring)

 

                   Tallis J.A.
expressly disavowed the view that committal on the lesser charge of common
assault constitutes a ""discharge"" under s. 548(1) (b) or 577 (b). 
Finding that s. 574(1) (b) was the controlling provision in this case, he
was of the view that this section empowers a prosecutor to prefer an indictment
in substitution for any charge on which the accused was ordered to stand
trial.  As the requirements of s. 574  had been met, he concluded that the
prosecutor was not precluded from substituting the original charge for the
charge on which the accused was committed to stand trial.  He also commented
that this conclusion was consistent with the decision reached in R. v.
Hampton (1990), 69 Man. R. (2d) 293, (leave to appeal denied, sub nom.
D.K.H. v. The Queen, [1991] 1 S.C.R. viii), where the Manitoba Court of
Appeal concluded that s. 574  allows the prosecutor to broaden the indictment in
keeping with what the evidence reveals.

 

Issue

 

                   As I mentioned at
the outset, the issue in this case is a narrow one of statutory
interpretation:  where an accused has elected to be tried by judge alone, does
s. 574(1) (b) of the Code  allow a prosecutor to prefer an
indictment on a given charge, even if a justice presiding at a preliminary
inquiry declines to commit the accused on that charge?  The appellant argues
that s. 574(1) (b) is not so broad, and that the prosecutor's power is
limited by the powers of a justice at a preliminary inquiry under s. 548 .  As
such, I will first briefly examine s. 548 , then, the context being established,
move on to examine the powers of the Crown to prefer an indictment under s.
574 .  Last I will consider the application of s. 574  to the facts of this
case.  

 

The Preliminary Inquiry

 

                   First, I would
emphasize that a preliminary inquiry is not a trial, and that the function of a
justice at a preliminary inquiry is, as Cory J. stated in R v. Barbeau,
[1992] 2 S.C.R. 845, at p. 853, ""to determine whether there is sufficient
evidence to commit the accused to trial.""  The inquiry provides the
accused with an opportunity to avoid the indignity of being placed on trial
where there is simply insufficient evidence to justify the holding of a trial at
all.  The justice presiding at such an inquiry has the task of determining
whether or not the accused should stand trial.  A decision that the accused
should be discharged is not appealable, and can be challenged only by way of certiorari. 
At the same time, a discharge is not a finding of ""not guilty"", and
cannot form the basis of a plea of autrefois acquit.

 

                   The powers of the
justice presiding at a preliminary inquiry are set out in s. 548, which reads
as follows:

 

                   548. (1)  When all the evidence has been
taken by the justice, he shall

 

(a) 
if in his opinion there is sufficient evidence to put the accused on trial for
the offence charged or any other indictable offence in respect of the same
transaction, order the accused to stand trial; or

 

(b) 
discharge the accused, if in his opinion on the whole of the evidence no
sufficient case is made out to put the accused on trial for the offence charged
or any other indictable offence in respect of the same transaction. [Emphasis
added.]

 

                   Section 548
authorizes a justice to take one of two possible actions: under s. 548(1) (a),
to order the accused to stand trial; under s. 548(1) (b), to discharge
the accused.  The second of these two options is taken when the justice is of
the opinion that ""no sufficient case is made out to put the accused on
trial for the offence charged or any other indictable offence in respect
of the same transaction"".  If there is evidence which would support any
indictable offence, the justice does not discharge the accused, but instead
commits the accused to stand trial.  Where the justice is of the opinion that
the accused should stand trial, s. 548(1) (a) confers very broad powers
of committal.  The section imposes few limitations, authorizing the justice to
commit on any offence, whether in addition to or in substitution for
those specified in the information.  The only limitation is that the charge
must be based on evidence disclosed at the preliminary inquiry.

 

The Powers to Prefer an Indictment

 

                   The provisions
dealing with powers of indictment are found in Part XX of the Code , in
particular, ss. 574  to 580 . Section 574  contains what is sometimes referred to
as the power of ordinary indictment, s. 577  the more extraordinary power of
direct indictment.  

 

                   In this case we are
concerned only with the ordinary power of indictment in s. 574 .  This is so
because s. 566  of the Code , reproduced above, specifically directs that
s. 577  has no application in judge alone trials.  According to this 1985
amendment to the Code , once an accused has elected to be tried by judge
alone, the prosecutor is limited to the power of ordinary indictment in s.
574 .  The wording of s. 574  bears repetition here, with the inapplicable
reference to s. 577  bracketed out:

 

                   574. (1)  Subject to subsection (3) [and
section 577 ], the prosecutor may prefer an indictment against any person who
has been ordered to stand trial in respect of

 

(a) 
any charge on which the person was ordered to stand trial, or

 

(b) 
any charge founded on the facts disclosed by the evidence taken on the
preliminary inquiry, in addition to or in substitution for any charge on which
that person was ordered to stand trial,

 

whether
or not the charges were included in one information.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

  
(3)  In any prosecution conducted by a prosecutor other than the Attorney
General and in which the Attorney General does not intervene, an indictment
shall not be preferred under subsection (1) before any court without the
written order of a judge of that court. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   What can be said
about the scope of the powers under this section?  First, an indictment can
only be preferred under s. 574  if an accused has had a preliminary inquiry, and
""has been ordered to stand trial"".  If a preliminary inquiry was not
held, or if the accused was not ordered to stand trial at all, no
indictment can be preferred pursuant to this section.  

 

                   Assuming these
threshold elements have been met, the prosecutor has two options.  First, under
s. 574(1) (a), the prosecutor can prefer an indictment on any charge on
which the accused was committed to stand trial.  Recall that, under s. 548(1) (a),
the justice at the preliminary inquiry can commit the accused on any
offence as long as it is one founded on the facts disclosed on the evidence. 
The justice and the prosecutor may agree that an accused should stand trial for
a given offence.  Where they agree, the prosecutor can simply adopt the opinion
of the justice at the preliminary inquiry, and prefer the indictment on those
specific charges under s. 574(1) (a).  

 

                   The prosecutor,
however, may not agree with the justice's opinion of the sufficiency of the
facts.  Where the justice and the prosecutor have differing views, s. 574(1) (b)
gives the prosecutor the authority to go beyond the charges selected by the
justice, and add or substitute charges.  This power is very broad;  the only
explicit limitation is that the charge must be one which is ""founded on
the facts disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry"". 
This is a limitation similar to the one placed on the justice under s. 548. 
The clear language of s. 574(1) (b) supports the interpretation followed
by the Court of Appeal.  That is, where an accused has been ordered to stand
trial, s. 574(1) (b) authorizes a prosecutor to add charges as long as
those charges are founded on the facts disclosed at the preliminary inquiry. 

 

                   At this point, I
return to the appellant's claim that s. 548 limits the scope of s. 574 .  First,
I would note that there is nothing in the language of s. 574  which would
support this claim.  Had Parliament intended that s. 574  be ""subject to s.
548"", these words could easily have been added.  Alternatively, s. 574(1)(b)
could have been drafted so as to give the prosecutor the sole power to prefer
""any charge founded on the facts except a charge on which the justice
conducting the preliminary inquiry has refused to order the accused to stand
trial"".  No such words are present.  Instead, the language of s.
574(1)(b) clearly gives the prosecutor the authority to add or
substitute ""any charge founded on the facts disclosed by the
evidence.""  There is no indication that these broad powers of indictment
are to be limited by s. 548, and I see no reason to read in words that simply
are not there.

 

                   Beyond the express
language of the section, the appellant argues that the limitation necessarily
arises by implication, given that the justice under s. 548 has made a finding
that the evidence does not support the charge.  He argues that deference should
be paid to this determination, and that the prosecutor should not be permitted
to ""over-rule"" the justice.  In my view, this argument
mischaracterizes the role of a justice at a preliminary inquiry and the
underlying rationale of s. 574 .

 

                   The primary role of
the justice is to determine whether or not the accused should stand trial.  The
justice makes this determination based on his or her opinion as to the
sufficiency of the evidence.  If the justice does not order the accused to
stand trial, the prosecutor has no power to prefer an indictment under
s. 574 .  This is the case even if the prosecutor is of the view that the evidence
presented was sufficient.  The preferring of indictments under this
section is contingent on the decision that an accused should be committed to
stand trial.  This has historically been the case.  As Lamer J. noted in McKibbon
v. The Queen, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 131, at p. 144:

 

...
once a preliminary had resulted in a committal, the system was lax as to what
charges could be preferred, the only prerequisite (even for speedy trials as a
matter of judicial practice) being that it be for a charge ""founded on the
facts or evidence disclosed in the depositions"".

 

                   Under the current
s. 548, the justice at a preliminary inquiry has powers of committal far
broader than was the case under previous Code  versions of this section. 
However, any charge must be founded on evidence disclosed at the
preliminary inquiry.  If it is not, the opinion of the justice that it is,
is simply irrelevant.  For example, let's assume for a moment that the
prosecutor prefers an indictment pursuant to s. 574(1) (a), for the
charges on which the justice ordered an accused to stand trial.  The accused
who feels that the charges are not founded on the evidence is entitled
to bring a motion before the trial judge to have the charges quashed.  The
judge hearing this motion is required to examine the actual record itself.  The
judge does not ""defer"" to the opinion of the justice at the
preliminary inquiry, but decides whether or not to quash based solely on the
evidence disclosed at the preliminary inquiry.  This is neither a question of
deferring nor of ""over-ruling.""  It is a matter of quashing or not
quashing an indictment based on the evidence.

 

                   Is anything
different if the prosecutor prefers an indictment under s. 574(1)(b)? 
Once again, an accused can bring a motion to quash, and once again, the judge
goes to the record.  The only question is whether the charge itself is founded
on the facts.  If it is not, the charge will be quashed.  This is not a
question of asking whether the prosecutor incorrectly ""over-ruled""
the justice, or whether the prosecutor should have deferred to the opinion of
the justice.  In this respect, I agree with the comments of Helper J.A. in R.
v. Hampton, supra, at p. 302:

 

The
specific charges upon which the justice commits the accused do not affect the
prosecutor's discretion under s. 574  to prefer the same, additional or
substituted charges against the accused. ...The condition precedent to the
exercise of the prosecutor's authority in s. 574  is the committal on a specific
transaction.  The exercise of that administrative discretion by the prosecutor
does not result in a collateral attack upon the decision of the magistrate
whose only power is to commit for trial or to discharge the accused from the
court process.

 

                   I would briefly
comment on another aspect of the appellant's argument.  He suggests that the
powers in s. 574  are not available where the accused has been discharged, and
that the word ""discharge"" in s. 548 should be given the meaning
""discharge on a specific offence"", relying on the decision of
this Court in McKibbon v. The Queen, supra.  In my view, the appellant's
reliance on this decision is misplaced.  

                   

                   First, McKibbon
v. The Queen is not strictly applicable to this case.  In that case, the
issue was the interpretation of s. 574 , but, as the legislation then stood,
this interpretation necessarily required the Court to consider the scope of s.
577.  When s. 548 and s. 577 were placed together, there were serious problems
related to the meaning to be given to the word ""discharged"".  The
interpretation of s. 574  adopted in that case was the only one possible in
order to give effect to the legislative scheme which, in that case, required
the reconciliation of ss. 548 , 574  and 577 .  However, McKibbon v. The Queen
was decided before the 1985 amendments, and involved a jury trial.  In the
present case, the Court is dealing with an amended legislative scheme, and a
different set of issues.  Mr. Tapaquon elected to be tried by judge alone. 
Because of the enactment of s. 566 , s. 577  has no application here.  In this
context, potential problems with the meaning of the term ""discharged""
in s. 577 should not be used to shape the interpretation of s. 574 , which is
clear and unambiguous.

 

                   Second, it is not
necessary for the Court to comment on the meaning of the word
""discharged"" as the question is simply not relevant to the issue
before us.  The issue is one of the interpretation of s. 574(1)(b). 
Under this section, the only question is whether or not the accused has had a
preliminary inquiry and has been committed to stand trial on any offence. 
If so, the prosecutor is authorized to prefer an indictment so long as the
charges are founded on the facts disclosed at the preliminary inquiry.  It does
not matter in the least whether the word ""discharge"" in s. 548 is given
a broad or narrow interpretation.  As noted above, s. 574(1)(b) gives
the Crown the authority to prefer an indictment on any charge founded on
the facts.  The opinion of a justice that there is insufficient evidence to
support a specific charge does not alter or limit this power.  This power is
limited only by the facts.

 

                   I find further
support for this interpretation of s. 574(1)(b) in the policy
considerations behind the different procedures applying to the ordinary and to
the direct powers of indictment.  Section 577 allows for an indictment to be
preferred where there has been no preliminary inquiry, or where the
accused has been discharged.  When an indictment is preferred under s.
577, the accused clearly does not enjoy the advantage of certain procedural
protections.  For example, there is no requirement that the indictment be
founded on any facts, and so an accused cannot bring a motion to quash.  In
this context, it is both reasonable and desirable that the prosecutor have the
personal consent of the Attorney General, whose political accountability acts
as a safeguard against potential abuse.  

 

                   Where, however,
ordinary indictments are preferred pursuant to s. 574 , an accused has
procedural protections.  A preliminary inquiry must be held, and the accused
must be committed to stand trial.  When the prosecutor then prefers an
indictment, whether under s. 574(1)(a) or (b), the charge must be
one which is ""founded on the facts disclosed by the evidence"".  If
the accused believes that the charge is not founded on the facts, the
accused can bring a motion to quash.  On such a motion, there is no burden on
the accused to prove the absence of facts.  Whether one looks at the
powers of the justice under s. 548, or the powers of the prosecutor under s.
574 , one thing is clear:  the charges must be founded on the facts.  The judge
hearing the motion to quash is required to ensure that there is in fact
a foundation for the preferring of that specific charge.  If the trial judge
finds that either the justice or the prosecutor was mistaken as to the
sufficiency of facts, the indictment will be quashed.  Under this
interpretation, unless the trial judge decides that the charge should be
quashed, there is no reason to require the intervention of the Attorney
General.  The accused has adequate procedural protection, and any potential for
abuse is greatly reduced, if not totally absent.

 

                   I conclude that,
where an accused has elected to be tried by judge alone, and where a justice
commits the accused to stand trial, s. 574(1)(b) allows the Crown to
prefer an indictment on any charge founded on the evidence given at the
preliminary inquiry, regardless of the opinion of the justice as to that
specific offence.  Such an indictment may be quashed if the charge is not
founded on the facts disclosed at the preliminary hearing.  This conclusion
reached, I turn to its application to the case at hand.

 

Application

 

                   On the motion to
quash, the trial judge, relying on his own interpretation of s. 574(1)(b),
concluded that the Crown did not have the authority to prefer the indictment in
this case.  Given this interpretation, the trial judge did not turn his mind to
the central question raised by the motion to quash, which is whether or not the
charges were founded on facts disclosed at the preliminary inquiry.  A
consideration of the evidence is, accordingly, in order to determine whether or
not the motion to quash was well founded.

                   

                   At the preliminary
inquiry, David Wood testified that he was a chaperon at the dance, and
identified the appellant in court as having struck him three times in the face
with a closed fist.  For greater certainty, he stated that the person who
struck him had been standing behind Joe Francis.  The first two blows had just
grazed his face, but the third blow landed on the left cheekbone rocking his
head around and knocking his glasses off, though not knocking him down. 
According to his evidence, ""apparently at that point I was struck from the
side or something and my head was slammed into a window and I was unconscious
from that point.""  He was unable to say where the last blow which rendered
him unconscious had come from.  He suffered a mild concussion, a broken left
front tooth, broken nose, bruises to the right side of the face, a cut lip and
sore ribs.  Two root canals were required in addition to the replacement of the
broken tooth.  The evidence indicated that the broken tooth was on the same
side of his face that was struck by the appellant.  

 

                   Michelle Guay also
testified that the appellant hit David Wood a couple of times.  She testified
that the appellant and others were all pushing, then she heard a big bang and
saw that David Wood was lying on the ground.  She indicated that the people
around David Wood at the time were Brad Spence, the appellant, and possibly Joe
Francis. She also gave evidence that she saw David Wood being kicked, and that
she thought the person doing the kicking was Brad Spence.  Her evidence
continued as follows:

 

Q.What
about Darren Tapaquon, where was he at this time?

 

A.He
was standing there.  I think somebody was holding him, or people were trying to
hold him back or something, like hold Darren and Brad.  They were telling them
to stop or whatever. 

 

                                                                    ...

 

Q.After
it had began, did you see where Darren Tapaquon was in relation to where that
fight was?

 

A.He
was like basically like David was laying, like laid out.  And I was standing in
front of him.  And Darren was standing about on this side and Brad was about
this side right here.  They were basically standing beside each other.

 

                   Stephen Liebel had
described the person standing behind Joe Francis as the only person from
outside wearing a pink shirt.  This person was, according to him, really trying
to provoke Joe into throwing the first punch, and said something to Joe along
the lines of ""stabbing or slicing at him,"" referring to either
Stephen Liebel or David Wood.  Stephen Liebel testified that two or three males
were kicking David as he was lying on the ground, and that David was kicked
once in the face and two or three times in the ribs.  

 

                   Jody Taylor
testified that the appellant took a couple of punches at David Wood and hit him
a couple of times in the face.  She identified the appellant in court, but for
greater certainty, added that the person who hit David Wood that night was
wearing a pony tail and either a pink or green neon shirt. 

 

                   Constable Thomas
Abrook who observed the appellant following his arrest identified him in court,
and described him as having a pony tail and a pink shirt which was out of
character of everybody else that was out there.  He also testified that the
appellant had a cut on his left ring finger consistent with injuries sustained
from punching something, and that the appellant also had blood on his shirt.

 

                   What to make of
this evidence?  Meagher Prov. Ct. J. concluded that the injuries to David Wood
were a result of the kicking, and that there was no evidence linking the
appellant to these kicks.  I disagree.  First, contrary to the conclusions of
the preliminary justice, being struck in the face may be consistent with a
broken nose, and damage to teeth.  Further, though Michelle Guay stated that
she saw Brad Spence doing the kicking, there was additional evidence that two or
three people had been kicking David Wood, and the accused was identified as one
of the people around the body.  There was also evidence that the appellant was
held back and that people were telling him to stop.  The appellant had blood on
his shirt, and injuries consistent with punching someone.  

 

                   Whatever the
evidence at trial may disclose, that is a matter for the trial judge.  At the
preliminary inquiry, however, it remains that there was, in my view, sufficient
evidence on the record to justify the preferring of an indictment on the charge
of assault causing bodily harm.

 

                   For these reasons,
I conclude that, under s. 574(1) (b) of the Code , where an accused
has elected to be tried by judge alone, a prosecutor has the authority to
prefer an indictment on any charge, so long as that charge is founded on facts
disclosed at the preliminary inquiry.  In this case, there was evidence of
assault causing bodily harm on the facts disclosed at the preliminary inquiry,
and I agree with the Court of Appeal that the motion to quash should have been
dismissed.

 

                   Since writing these
reasons, I have had occasion to read those of my colleague Justice Sopinka and
I would like to add the following.

 

                   My colleague states
at p. 546 that, once the justice presiding the preliminary inquiry ""has
heard all of the evidence, his or her refusal to commit on an offence charged
in the information amounts to a judicial determination that the charge
is not ""founded on the facts disclosed by the evidence""""
(emphasis added).   I disagree.   This statement, in my view, implies a larger
role for the justice than contemplated by the Code  (s. 548 ).   The
justice's role at the preliminary inquiry consists only in the
determination of whether or not the accused should stand trial, as this Court
unanimously held in R. v. Barbeau, supra.   It also implies that
deference should be paid to his or her ""judicial determination"",
therefore again mischaracterizing the role of the justice at a preliminary
inquiry.   As I indicated earlier, the prosecutor who prefers an indictment
under s. 574(1) (b) does not overrule the justice.   My colleague relies
on s. 548  of the Code  and on the fact that the justice presiding at the
preliminary enquiry makes a ""judicial determination"" to conclude that
the ""appropriate disposition of charges for which there is insufficient
evidence to put the accused on trial is discharge of the accused on those
charges"" (p. 547).   In this connection, the meaning of s. 574  is very
clear and does not require the determination of the accused's status in respect
of the charges for which there was insufficient evidence to put him or her on
trial.  Section 574(1) (b) states that an indictment can be preferred in
respect of ""any charge founded on the facts disclosed by the evidence
taken on the preliminary inquiry, in addition to or in substitution for
any charge on which that person was ordered to stand trial"" (emphasis
added).   I cannot see how such clear wording could prevent an
indictment from being preferred in respect of a charge for which the justice
found that there was insufficient evidence to put the accused on trial. 
Section 574  does not deal with the question of discharge.   Contrary to what my
colleague asserts, while I agree that the Code  must be read as a whole (R.
v. Compagnie Immobilière BCN Ltée, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 865), when s. 566(3)  is
read in context, it is clear that only s. 574 , and not s. 577 , applies where
the accused elects to be tried by a judge without a jury.  To go beyond such clear
words would violate Parliament's intent.  Section 577  applies only to jury
trials and is of no help in the interpretation of s. 574 .   These are two
separate and different rules which obey different imperatives.

 

                   The reference to McKibbon
v. The Queen, supra, is not relevant.   That case dealt with s. 577 in the
context of a jury trial, before the 1985 amendments.   According to my
colleague, the 1985 amendments were not intended to make fundamental changes
but rather were more in the nature of a codification of the powers of
prosecutors to prefer indictments.   Even if this were so, s. 496 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, which governed trials without a jury, made
no reference to whether an accused was discharged or not (see s. 496(2)(b)).  
Consequently, McKibbon v. The Queen cannot support my colleague's point
that the issue of whether the accused was discharged is relevant to this case.

 

                   Furthermore, it
makes eminent sense that, for the more serious crimes, those to be tried before
judge and jury, exigences be greater than for less serious crimes, those tried
before judge alone.  This is, in my view, what ss. 577  and 574  of the Code 
aim to accomplish.  My colleague's interpretation blurs that distinction to the
point of devoiding s. 574 of its real meaning.

 

                   As a result, I
would dismiss the appeal.

                   The accused was
charged with sexual assault and kidnapping.  On the day of the incident, the
complainant, a 17‑year‑old girl who had been under psychiatric
treatment for depression and anxiety, went with two men, D and S, to B's
trailer, where they drank beer.  Later in the afternoon, the complainant and D,
whom she had dated on a few occasions, had consensual intercourse in a wooded
area.  After D went home, the accused and his friend M arrived at the trailer
and left with B to go to a nearby pub while S and the complainant stayed at the
trailer and engaged in sexual intercourse.  In the evening, M and the accused
came back to the trailer.  While the accused drove S some distance away, M
attempted to have intercourse with the complainant.  She testified that she did
not consent to his advances and that he prevented her from getting dressed. 
She managed to get her underpants on as the accused entered the room.  He threw
her over his shoulder and carried her out to the car.  The complainant
testified that she resisted leaving the trailer and asked for her clothes but that
the accused put her in the back seat of the car and tore off her underpants.  M
drove them to a cabin 40 miles away and left.  The accused pulled her into
a bedroom, tied her up and had sexual intercourse with her.  Shortly after
3:30 a.m., an RCMP constable found the complainant on the highway.  She
was screaming and crying.  She was taken to the hospital where her medical
examination revealed a number of injuries generally more consistent with sexual
assault than consensual intercourse.  The police also found a pair of torn
women's underpants lying on the ground some 20 feet from the trailer.

 

                   At trial, the
accused testified that the complainant was an eager although not active
participant in all the acts leading up to and including sexual intercourse. 
She only resisted when he tried to shave her pubic area at the cabin.  The
accused admitted, however, that he ""overrode"" her complaints about
being forced while naked to leave the trailer.  Defence counsel sought to cross‑examine
the complainant on her medical records, specifically on a notation indicating
that she was concerned that her attitude and behaviour may have influenced the
accused to some extent.  He indicated that the cross‑examination would be
directed toward ""what kind of person the complainant is"".  The trial
judge refused to permit the cross‑examination, ruling that the records
had been admitted into evidence for the limited purpose of determining the
complainant's competence to testify and that to use them for any other purpose
would be a violation of the complainant's privacy.  He also declined to charge
the jury with respect to the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent. 
He ruled that in this case there was no ""air of reality"" to the
defence.  The accused was found guilty on both counts and his appeal to the
Court of Appeal was dismissed.  This appeal raises two issues:  (1) whether the
trial judge erred in restricting the cross‑examination of the complainant
on her medical records; and (2) whether the ""air of reality"" test set
out in s. 265(4)  of the Criminal Code  violates the accused's rights
under ss. 11 (d) and 11 (f) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms .

 

                   Held (La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be
allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

                   (1)  Per
Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ.
(La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ.
dissenting):  The trial judge erred in failing to allow the cross‑examination
of the complainant on her medical records.

 

                   (2)  Section 265(4)
of the Code does not violate s. 11 (d) or 11 (f) of the
Charter .

 

                                 ‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑

 

                   Per Cory and Major JJ.:  The right
to cross‑examine witnesses, which is now protected by ss. 7  and 11 (d)
of the Charter , is fundamental to providing a fair trial to an accused. 
Despite its importance, the right to cross‑examine has never been
unlimited and must conform to the basic principle that all evidence must be
relevant in order to be admissible.  In addition, the probative value of
evidence must be weighed against its prejudicial effect.  Relevance and
probative value must be determined in the context of the purpose for which
evidence is tendered.  In the context of sexual assaults, this limitation on
cross‑examination has been recognized to prevent its use for improper
purposes.  Both Seaboyer and the new s. 276  of the Criminal Code 
suggest the factors which should be considered in limiting the scope of cross‑examination
of a complainant in a sexual assault trial.  Sections 15  and 28  of the Charter 
guaranteeing equality to men and women, although not determinative, should also
be taken into account in determining the reasonable limitations.  Generally, a
complainant may be cross‑examined for the purpose of eliciting evidence
relating to consent and pertaining to credibility when the probative value of
that evidence is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice
which might flow from it.  Cross‑examination for the purpose of showing
consent or impugning credibility which relies upon groundless rape myths and
fantasized stereotypes is improper and should not be permitted.  The trial
judge must consider all of the evidence presented at the voir dire to
determine if there is a legitimate purpose for the proposed cross‑examination. 
In each case he must carefully balance the accused's right to a fair trial
against the need for reasonable protection of a complainant.  If at the conclusion
of the voir dire the cross‑examination is permitted then the jury
must be advised as to the proper use that can be made of the evidence derived
from the cross‑examination.  Here, the privacy of the complainant is an
interest that merits protection, as does the need for a relationship of
confidence between a patient and her psychiatrist, but the cross‑examination
on the complainant's medical records, within the guidelines outlined, should
have been permitted to ensure a fair trial and to avoid a miscarriage of
justice.  While the trial judge was correct in refusing to permit cross‑examination
for the purpose of determining ""what kind of person the complainant
is"", it was the trial judge's duty to ensure that the accused's rights
with regard to cross‑examination were protected.  It would have been
appropriate to permit cross‑examination on the medical records, in
particular the notation, to determine if they would throw any light either on a
possible motive for the complainant's allegation that she was the victim of
sexual assault or with regard to her conduct which might have led the accused
to believe that she was consenting to sexual advances.  There was thus a proper
purpose for permitting cross‑examination on the medical records.  The
denial of the opportunity to cross‑examine on these records, and the
impossibility of ascertaining what might have been the result of the cross‑examination,
make it necessary to order a new trial.

 

                   Section 265(4)
of the Code simply sets out the basic requirements which are applicable
to all defences:  a defence should not be put to the jury if a reasonable jury
properly instructed would have been unable to acquit on the basis of the
evidence tendered in support of that defence.  In other words, there must be
evidence sufficient to give an air of reality to the defence before it can be
left with the jury.  It is the trial judge who determines if there is
sufficient evidence adduced to give rise to a defence.  The defence of honest
but mistaken belief in consent in a sexual assault trial must meet the same
threshold requirement as that demanded of all defences.  There must be evidence
that gives an air of reality to the accused's argument that he believed the
complainant was consenting before the issue goes to the jury.  There is no
requirement that there be evidence independent of the accused.  What is
required is that the defence be supported by evidence beyond the mere assertion
of a mistaken belief.  The defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent can
realistically only arise when the accused and the complainant tell essentially
the same story and then argue that they interpreted it differently.  Where the
evidence given is directly opposed as to whether there was consent, the defence
simply cannot exist.  However, even in the absence of the defence, the jury
will nonetheless be bound to acquit if it has a reasonable doubt as to whether
there was consent in light of the conflicting evidence on the issue.  In this
case, the Court of Appeal correctly held that the trial judge erred in finding
that the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent was unavailable on
the basis of the accused's evidence alone.  However, it erred in finding that
there could be no air of reality to the defence on the basis that the complainant
had been kidnapped by the accused since there had not been a previous or
separate conviction on the kidnapping charge.  The mens rea for the
kidnapping charge and that for the sexual assault were so closely connected as
to be inseparable.  The kidnapping could therefore not be used as the basis for
rejecting the defence.  As there must be a new trial to allow for a cross‑examination
on the medical records, it would be inappropriate to discuss whether there was
sufficient evidence to justify putting the defence to the jury in light of the
fresh evidence that may be forthcoming.

 

                   Section 265(4)
of the Code does not infringe s. 11 (d) of the Charter . 
While the air of reality threshold in s. 265(4)  creates an evidentiary
burden on the accused, in the sense that he must raise sufficient evidence to
give the defence an air of reality to justify its presentation to the jury, the
burden of proving all the elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt
rests squarely with the Crown.  All criminal defences must meet a threshold
requirement of sufficient evidence  before the trial judge should leave them
with a jury.  This does not violate the presumption of innocence.  Nor does
s. 265(4)  infringe s. 11 (f) of the Charter .  The
requirement that there be an air of reality to the defence of honest but
mistaken belief in consent is reasonable and entirely valid.  It is only a
reaffirmation of an integral part of the judge's role in supervising a jury
trial.  Whether there is sufficient evidence to raise a defence is a question
of law, and therefore is properly in the domain of the judge.  There was
consequently no violation of the accused's right to a trial by jury.

 

                   Per Iacobucci J.:  Cory J.'s
reasons were agreed with; however, no comment was expressed on the new s. 276 
of the Criminal Code .

 

                   Per Sopinka J.: Cory J.'s
reasons were agreed with, subject to the following reservations.  First, no
comment was expressed on the new s. 276  of the Criminal Code . 
Second, with respect to the defence of honest but mistaken belief,
s. 265(4) of the Code sets out the basic requirements applicable to
all defences.  It requires no more of the accused than the discharge of an
evidentiary burden to adduce or point to some evidence on the basis of which a
reasonable jury properly instructed could acquit.  The addition of the term
""air of reality"" does not help in understanding the duty of a trial
judge with respect to this defence and may only create confusion.  Third, the
defence of honest but mistaken belief is not excluded when the complainant and
the accused relate diametrically opposed versions of what occurred.  To exclude
the defence in these circumstances would rest on the questionable assumption
that either the accused's or the complainant's story is a complete account of
what occurred.  In assessing the evidence of a witness, it is not an all‑or‑nothing
proposition.  The jury may accept only some of what a witness said, and reject
the rest.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J.: The trial judge
erred in failing to allow the cross‑examination of the complainant on her
medical records.  The cross‑examination was appropriate because it had a
proper purpose ‑‑ namely, to determine whether there was evidence
to support a defence of honest but mistaken belief or evidence to support an
allegation of fabrication.  The denial of the opportunity to cross‑examine
on the medical records deprived the accused of his right to a fair trial.

 

                   With respect to the
defence of honest but mistaken belief, Sopinka J.'s reasons were agreed
with.

 

                   Per La Forest, Gonthier and
McLachlin JJ. (dissenting):  Before cross‑examination can be allowed
on a complainant's prior sexual conduct, the trial judge must determine whether
the defence has demonstrated a potential relevance to the cross‑examination
capable of outweighing the damage and invasion of privacy it might cause to the
complainant.  To be satisfied that the threshold of relevance is met, the trial
judge must ensure that the evidence is tendered for a legitimate purpose, and
that it logically supports a defence.  Here, the only purpose invoked by the
defence for cross‑examining the complainant on her medical records was
the very sort of improper purpose for which evidence cannot be adduced.  The
defence's failure to raise a valid reason for the cross‑examination was
fatal.  In our criminal trial system, the trial judge does not have a duty to
ensure that all legitimate grounds of cross‑examination are explored by
counsel.  Further, even assuming that a court of appeal confronted by an
unexplored avenue of cross‑examination which might have led to a
reasonable doubt as to guilt should direct a new trial to avoid a miscarriage
of justice, the accused is not entitled to a new trial in this case on the
ground of denial of cross‑examination since no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice occurred.  On the defence theory that the complainant
may have fabricated her story to avoid a confrontation with her parents, there
was ample evidence before the jury of the difficult relationship between the
complainant and her parents and their disapproval of some of her conduct.  On
the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent, there was also a great
deal of negative evidence before the jury about the complainant's
""attitude and behaviour"" on the day in question.

 

                   Before any defence
can be put to the jury, the evidence must provide a basis for that defence.  It
must have an ""air of reality"".  In order to give an air of reality to
the defence of honest but mistaken belief, there must be:  (1) evidence of
lack of consent to the sexual acts; and (2) evidence that notwithstanding
the actual refusal, the accused honestly but mistakenly believed that the
complainant was consenting.  The bare assertion of the accused that he believed
in consent is not enough to raise the defence; the assertion must be supported
to some degree by other evidence or circumstances.  The supporting evidence may
come from the accused or from other sources.  The defence of honest but
mistaken belief is not precluded where the evidence consists of two
diametrically opposed stories, one alleging lack of consent and the other
consent.  In rare situations, it is possible for a jury to accept parts of the
testimonies of both the complainant and the accused, concluding that
notwithstanding lack of actual consent, the accused honestly believed in
consent.  In this case, there was no evidence, from the accused or from some
other source, supporting the accused's assertion of honest belief.  Finally,
the Court of Appeal did not use the kidnapping charge as a ground for rejecting
the defence of honest but mistaken belief.  It only said that the evidence of
confinement robbed that defence of any foundation.

 

                   For the reasons
given by Cory J., s. 265(4) of the Code does not violate s.
11 (d) or 11 (f) of the Charter .

 

                   Per La Forest and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ.
(dissenting): In criminal cases, the defence normally has no access to the
medical records of a witness.  Medical records evidence is generally completely
marginal to the central issue of a trial.  Given the fundamental importance
placed on the confidentiality of medical records in our society, and the high
degree of prejudice to the witness caused by delving into these records, they
should only be disclosed in the rare cases when there is cogent evidence to suggest
(1) that the competence of the witness to testify is in serious doubt or
the witness's testimony with respect to the particular issue to be decided is
unreliable because of the witness's medical condition; and (2) that
without such disclosure,  there would be serious prejudice to the accused's
right to make full answer and defence.  Mere suggestion, speculation or
possibility raised on the part of the defence that such records may be relevant
cannot be sufficient.  Fishing expeditions should not be permitted. In the
event that disclosure is required, the cross‑examination on the witness's
medical records must be restricted to the purpose for which they were
introduced.  Even when the records contain information that is relevant to
other issues to be decided, cross‑examination on such information should,
except in extraordinary cases, nonetheless remain impermissible.  Trial judges
possess the undoubted discretion to both exclude evidence and limit cross‑examination
on matters which, although arguably relevant to the issue, are outweighed by
their potential to prejudice the trial of the issue.  Particularly in the case
of complainants in sexual assault trials, there is a serious risk that such
information will be used to draw impermissible inferences and encourage the
trier of fact to rely on myths about the credibility of sexual assault victims
to the prejudice of both the witness and the trial process.  Here, the
complainant's medical records should not have been disclosed to the accused and
admitted into evidence.  There was no evidence that the complainant was
incapable of giving reliable testimony in general, let alone reliable testimony
as to the particular issue to be decided ‑‑ the issue of consent ‑‑
or that the complainant was in fact suffering from a condition that would
affect her capacity to give reliable testimony.  However, once the medical
records were disclosed, the trial judge was correct in restricting the purposes
for which they could be used and in concluding that the privacy of the complainant
was an important value which should play a role in determining the scope of the
use of the medical records.

 

                   The accused was not
denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence because he was unable to
cross‑examine the complainant on her medical records, including the
notation.  The material in these records was not relevant to the issue of her
consent to the sexual assault.  On that issue, the jury already had the benefit
of the complainant's direct testimony as to the events themselves and the
absence of her consent.  She was also cross‑examined extensively on this
point.  There was thus no need to resort to the medical records.  On the issue
of the accused's honest but mistaken belief in consent, the complainant's
thoughts about the sexual assault after the fact are completely irrelevant. 
The defence normally only arises where the complainant and the accused tell
essentially the same story about what occurred but differ in their
interpretations as to whether the activity in question amounted to consent.  In
this case, any mistake of perception or interpretation that might have existed
was a matter located solely in the accused's mind.  Finally, the material in
the medical records concerning the complainant's relationship with her parents
was not relevant to the issue of whether she was sexually assaulted.  In any
event, the jury was already aware of the complainant's difficulties with her
parents and the theory of the defence that she invented the story of the
assault to avoid repercussions with her parents.  It is obvious that the
proposed cross‑examination to determine ""what kind of person the
complainant is"" would have been highly prejudicial.  Its purpose was to
attack the complainant's credibility in a general way by putting before the jury
every difficulty in her personal life in the hope that they would then draw
negative inferences about her character and credibility.  Cross‑examination
for this purpose is clearly impermissible.  These are precisely the inferences
based upon rape myths which work to the prejudice of complainants in sexual
assault cases and which Parliament, in enacting s. 276 of the Code,
has attempted to prevent.  Furthermore, the proposed cross-examination could
only have prejudiced the trial by distracting the jury from the narrow issue of
consent.

 

                   The trial judge was
correct in not putting the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent to
the jury.  In the circumstances of this case, there was no air of reality to
the defence.  While it was open to the jury to disbelieve the complainant and
either believe or have a reasonable doubt as to the testimony of the accused,
the jury was obliged to reach their verdict on the basis of the evidence before
them.  Had the trial judge left the defence with the jury, he would have been
inviting them to speculate on yet a third version of events wholly unsupported
by the evidence of either party.  To do so would have been an error on the part
of the trial judge.

 

                   For the reasons
given by Cory J., s. 265(4) of the Code does not violate s.
11 (d) or 11 (f) of the Charter .

 

                   The
reasons of McLachlin J. were substantially agreed with.

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   Lamer
C.J. -- I have read the
reasons of Justice Cory and concur in his result.

 

                   I agree with my
colleague that the trial judge erred in refusing to permit cross-examination on
the medical records.  The cross-examination was appropriate because it had a
proper purpose -- to determine whether there was evidence to support a defence
of honest but mistaken belief or evidence to support an allegation of
fabrication.  The denial of the opportunity to cross-examine on the medical
records deprived the accused of his right to a fair trial.

 

                   With respect to the
defence of mistaken belief, I am in agreement with my colleague, Justice
Sopinka.

 

                   Accordingly, I
would allow the appeal and order a new trial on the ground that the trial judge
erred in failing to allow the cross-examination of the complainant on her
medical records.

 

                   The reasons of La
Forest and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ. were delivered by

 

                   L'Heureux-Dubé
J. (dissenting) -- I have
had the advantage of the reasons of my colleagues and for the following reasons
I do not agree with Cory J.'s reasons nor with his disposition of the appeal. 
I agree substantially with McLachlin J.'s reasons as well as the result she
reaches.  However, I wish to deal with additional points as well as different
considerations on the points dealt with by my colleagues.

 

                   I will discuss the
two issues raised in this appeal in the following order.  First, does s. 265(4) 
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , infringe the rights of the
accused as guaranteed by s. 11 (d) or 11 (f) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?  Second, did the trial judge err in
restricting the cross-examination of the complainant on her medical records? 
This second issue raises, in turn, questions concerning the privacy interest in
medical records and the particular considerations which surround complainants
in sexual assault trials.

 

Constitutionality of
Section 265(4)  of the Criminal Code 

 

                   On the issue of the
constitutionality of s. 265(4)  of the Criminal Code , I agree with
my colleagues' reasons that the section infringes neither s. 11 (d)
nor s. 11 (f) of the Charter .  The general rule is that
defences should not be put to the jury which do not arise on the evidence.  As
with any defence, this section simply requires that, in the case of assault,
there be a factual foundation, or, to put it more colloquially, an ""air of
reality"" to a defence before the trial judge is required to leave it with
the jury.  Thus, the section conforms completely with normal trial procedure
and the interests in ensuring that the jury is not distracted by extraneous
matters in the trial of an issue.

 

                   As to its relevance
in this particular case, in my opinion, the defence of mistaken belief in
consent was completely unwarranted given both the evidence and the manner in
which the defence was conducted.  This case involves, as the trial judge put
it, ""a straight issue of consent or no consent"".  The complainant and
the appellant each testified as to the events in issue.  The evidence of each
concerning the events preceding the assault was consistent up to a certain
point.  Specifically, there is no question that the complainant was taken by
the appellant to a cabin 40 miles away in the woods in the winter without her
clothes on; nor does the appellant contest that he overrode her objections in
doing so.

 

                   However, their
versions differed completely in respect of consent to sexual relations.  The
defence proceeded entirely on the basis that the complainant willingly and
eagerly consented to sexual relations, not that he may have been mistaken about
whether or not she consented.  By contrast, the complainant testified that at
no time did she consent to the sexual activity in question but had been subject
to a series of assaults beginning when the appellant abducted her in a car. 
This testimony was corroborated by both physical evidence and the testimony of
other witnesses.

 

                   By way of example,
I shall recount but a portion of the evidence.  The complainant testified that
her panties had been ripped off her when she was taken away by the appellant in
the car; ripped panties were found by the police near where the car had been
parked.  She testified that she was struck on the head while she was taken into
the car and bound by the wrists when she was assaulted; medical evidence
confirmed that she had bruises on her wrists and on her head.  In addition, the
police officer who found her naked by the side of the road at 3:30 a.m.
testified that she cried uncontrollably for two hours afterwards and vomited in
the police station.

 

                   Under these
circumstances, there was no air of reality to the defence of mistaken belief in
consent.  The jury found the appellant guilty of sexual assault.  While it was
open to the jury to disbelieve the complainant and either believe or have a
reasonable doubt as to the testimony of the appellant, the jury was obliged to
reach their verdict on the basis of the evidence before them.  Had the trial
judge left the defence with the jury, he would have been inviting them to
speculate on yet a third version of events wholly unsupported by the evidence
of either party.  To do so would have been an error on the part of the trial
judge, subject to review on appeal.

 

Cross-examination on
Medical Records

 

                   In this case, there
was no challenge to the ability of the complainant to testify at the outset;
the trial judge found her ""quite capable of testifying"" and noted
that her competency had never been called into question.  Nonetheless, because
the appellant was aware that she had a history of hospital admissions for
psychiatric problems, he sought an order for the production of the
complainant's medical records.  The trial judge decided, on the basis of Toohey
v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner, [1965] 1 All E.R. 506 (H.L.), and R.
v. Hawke (1975), 22 C.C.C. (2d) 19 (Ont. C.A.), that in order to permit the
accused the opportunity of full answer and defence, the medical records of the
complainant should be made available to the defence.  This was done for the
sole purpose of permitting the defence to attempt to establish that the
complainant suffered from a medical or psychiatric condition that rendered her
testimony unreliable.  Despite free use of the information in the records and
the testimony of its own psychiatric expert, the defence was unable to succeed
in demonstrating that the complainant was, for this reason, an unreliable
witness.

 

                   However, having
failed at this objective, once in possession of the medical records, the
defence then argued that because the records were allowed in, it should be
permitted unrestricted cross-examination on them to challenge the credibility
of the complainant on the issue of consent.  The trial judge refused to allow
such cross-examination on the grounds that it would be a violation of the
complainant's privacy.  The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had erred
in refusing the cross-examination because of the complainant's right to
privacy, but dismissed this ground of appeal because it was unable to ascertain
the questions that the appellant's counsel intended to ask.

 

                   Cory J. is of the
view that the trial judge should have permitted cross-examination on the July
9th notation in the medical records for the purpose of determining if there was
an air of reality to the appellant's defence of mistaken belief in the
complainant's consent.

 

                   I totally disagree
with my colleague Cory J. on the issue of the cross-examination of the complainant
on her medical records, as does my colleague McLachlin J.  Furthermore, there
is a prior issue which must be addressed:  whether the records should have been
disclosed to the appellant and admitted into evidence at all in the
circumstances.  In this case, the Crown has not cross-appealed the order for
the production of the complainant's medical records to the appellant, although
prior to the disclosure order, counsel argued vigorously before the trial judge
that they were totally irrelevant and that their use would be highly
prejudicial to the complainant and sidetrack the trial of the issue.  However,
as many of the concerns which I shall outline below are relevant to both the
question of disclosure and the scope of cross-examination in the event that
disclosure is ordered, I find it unavoidable to address the matter of
disclosure to some degree as well in this case.

 

                   It must be recalled
at the outset that, as is the case with witnesses in any trial, the defence
ordinarily has no access to the medical records of the complainant in a sexual
assault case.  The reason is clear:  such information is, in the vast majority
of cases, irrelevant to the issue to be determined.  As a matter of policy and
procedure we do not permit random fishing expeditions and less so into matters
that cannot be expected to have any bearing on the trial.  Moreover, such an
invasion of the privacy of an individual goes against the policy of privileged
communications between doctor and patient which some provinces, Quebec in particular,
do protect unless a superior interest is at stake.

 

                   Thus the question
becomes, whether, upon the release of such records, the right of the accused to
make full answer and defence entails the right to cross-examine on information
generated from medical records that, except for the extraordinary circumstance
of a challenge to the competence of a witness or the reliability of her
testimony, would be completely unavailable and even unknown to the accused.  In
my opinion it does not.  Moreover, in my view, the starting point to the
examination of this question is not the wide ability of the accused to
cross-examine the complainant, but, rather, the following two considerations
which arise much earlier in the trial process:  the fundamental entitlement of
us all, guaranteed by s. 8  of the Charter , to privacy and control
over personal information obtained to facilitate medical treatment and the
principle that information that is not relevant to an issue is to be excluded.

 

                   Hence, the
following two interrelated questions must be addressed.  First, under what
circumstances is disclosure of the psychiatric or medical history of a witness
imperative to the interests of justice and the ability of the accused to fully
answer the accusations he faces?  In other words, when and why are such records
relevant?  Second, should the use of such information, even if disclosed to the
defence, be limited?

 

                   In my view, these
issues must be examined in light of the general expectation held by society
that the privacy interest in information obtained for medical and therapeutic
purposes will be respected.  First, the existing rules regarding challenges to
the competence of witnesses and the reliability of testimony must be examined. 
Second, one must consider the evidentiary principles governing the admission of
evidence and cross-examination.  Third, the policy concerns raised by
permitting widespread use of medical records must be addressed.  Finally, the
particular concerns which surround challenges to the credibility of witnesses
in sexual assault trials must be confronted.

 

Analysis

 

1.  Privacy

 

                   This Court has
recognized that the value of privacy is fundamental to the notions of dignity
and autonomy of the person (R. v. Pohoretsky, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 945, and R.
v. Dyment, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417).  Equally, privacy in relation to personal
information and, in particular, the ability to control the purpose and manner
of its disclosure, is necessary to ensure the dignity and integrity of the
individual.  In the words of La Forest J. in Dyment, supra, at
pp. 429-30, while

 

[w]e
may, for one reason or another, wish or be compelled to reveal such
information, ... situations abound where the reasonable expectations of the
individual that the information shall remain confidential to the persons to
whom, and restricted to the purposes for which it is divulged, must be
protected.

 

We also recognize that it is often
important that privacy interests be respected at the point of disclosure if
they are to be protected at all, as they often cannot be vindicated after the
intrusion has already occurred (Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R.
145, and Dyment, at p. 430).

 

                   The importance of
privacy as a fundamental value in our society is underscored by the protection
afforded to everyone under s. 8  of the Charter  ""to be
secure against unreasonable search or seizure"".  This value finds expression
in such legislation as the Privacy Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. P-21 ,
which restricts the purposes for which information may be used to those for
which it was received.

 

                   The question of
privacy of medical information was extensively discussed in the reasons of La
Forest J. in Dyment, supra.  In that case, La Forest J. noted
that the confidentiality of the doctor-patient relationship has long been
respected as an important social value.  Protection of information is necessary
because persons are especially vulnerable in such circumstances; in order to
protect their life or health, they are required to reveal information of an
intimate character.  La Forest J. also observed in Dyment, on the basis
of the Department of Communications/Department of Justice Task Force report on Privacy
and Computers (1972), that hospitals have been identified as a specific
area of concern in the protection of privacy.  As the Report of the
Commission of Inquiry into the Confidentiality of Health Information
(Ontario 1980) found, in vol. 2, at p. 91, there are concerns that
persons in need of medical care might be deterred from seeking valuable and
needed treatment if the exchange of information were routine and easily
available.  Thus, the report concluded that ""physicians, hospital
employees and other health-care workers ought not to be made part of the law
enforcement machinery of the state"".  Not only would trust in the
administration of justice be undermined by such practices, but so would the
effective operation of medical care.

 

                   The decision in Dyment
clearly establishes the commitment of this Court to the value of privacy of
medical information.  In addition, the Court has also recognized the fiduciary
nature of the doctor-patient relationship and the special duties that arise
from this relationship of trust and confidence in McInerney v. MacDonald,
[1992] 2 S.C.R. 138, and Norberg v. Wynrib, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 226.

 

                   In light of these
general principles, the Court has seen fit to protect privacy interests in
relation to specific and limited medical activities such as the taking of a
blood sample where the interests of the accused are at stake (see R. v.
Dersch, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 768).  There is no doubt that any attempt by the
Crown to conduct a wide-ranging inquiry into the entire medical history of a
criminal accused would be met with concerns about prejudice to the accused and
irrelevance to the issue at trial.

 

                   However, while it
was the rights of the accused that were at stake in Dyment, as well as
in Dersch, supra, the interest in the privacy of medical records
was recognized in the former case as a broad and independent value, separate
and distinct from considerations about the fairness of the trial process. 
Thus, the privacy interest discussed in Dyment may be seen as an interest
that pertains to all of us which may arise in a number of different
circumstances.  Indeed, it would be odd if the protection of medical records
were to be available only to those accused of criminal offences.  Such a
finding could hardly inspire confidence in the administration of justice.  In
my opinion, the inescapable conclusion is that the arguments expressed in Dyment
in respect of privacy interests are equally applicable, if not more compelling,
in the case of witnesses called by the Crown in a criminal matter.

 

                   Because the trial
judge in this case based the disclosure order on the following jurisprudence, I
shall next turn to an examination of the rules governing the challenges to the
competence and the reliability of witnesses.

 

2.  Competence and
Challenges to the Reliability of Testimony

 

                   In the present
case, the trial judge, relying on the rule in Toohey, supra,
followed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Hawke, supra, ordered the
disclosure of the complainant's records to the appellant in order to permit him
to attempt to establish the unreliability of the complainant's testimony.

 

                   The basic rule as
to challenges to the competency of witnesses is as follows.  All witnesses,
with the exception of children under a specified age, are presumed competent to
testify unless and until found otherwise due to some condition which renders it
unsafe for the trier of fact to rely on the testimony.  A finding that the
witness suffers from a particular mental or psychiatric condition does not
necessarily or in itself disqualify a witness; in order to disqualify a
witness, the witness's particular condition must be such as to substantially
negative the trustworthiness of the evidence on the specific subject.

 

                   This issue was
canvassed extensively by Dubin J.A. (now C.J.O.) in Hawke, supra.  As he
noted, citing McCormick's Handbook of the Law of Evidence (2nd ed.
1972), {SS} 45, at p. 93, ""a distinction must be made between
attacks on competency and attacks on credibility"".  Wigmore, for his part,
has this to say:

 

                   This
broad and rational principle -- that the derangement or defect, in order to
disqualify, must be such as substantially negatives trustworthiness upon the specific
subject of the testimony -- is now practically everywhere accepted.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   First, the mere fact of derangement or
defect does not in itself exclude the witness; the various forms of
monomania are no longer treated as equivalent to complete lunacy;

 

                   Secondly, the inquiry is always as to the
relation of the derangement or defect to the subject to be testified
about.  If on this subject no aberration appears, the person is acceptable,
however untrustworthy on other subjects;  [Emphasis in original.]

 

(Wigmore on Evidence (3rd ed.
1940), vol. 2, {SS} 492, at pp. 585-86.)

 

                   From these general
principles, it is apparent that, in order to challenge the competency of a
witness to testify, it must be established that the witness is unable to
give reliable evidence on the specific issue in question.  In addition, as an
exception to the general rule which provides that an expert may not testify as
to the credibility of a witness, expert testimony is permitted to establish
that the witness suffers from some ""hidden defect"" which affects the
reliability of the testimony.  However, as both the trial judge and the Court
of Appeal found in this case, this situation must be distinguished from that of
calling an expert to establish that a witness, though capable of testifying
reliably, chooses not to do so.

 

                   The general
principle is set out as follows in Toohey, supra.  In that case, Lord
Pearce, speaking for all the law lords, held at p. 512 that:

 

Medical
evidence is admissible to show that a witness suffers from some disease or
defect or abnormality of mind that affects the reliability of his evidence. 
Such evidence is not confined to a general opinion of the unreliability of the
witness, but may give all the matters necessary to show not only the foundation
of and reasons for the diagnosis but also the extent to which the credibility of
the witness is affected.

 

                   In Hawke,
the Ontario Court of Appeal followed Toohey and held that the trial
judge had erred in rejecting psychiatric evidence given by the doctors of a
crucial witness in a murder trial.  At the time of the trial, the witness had
been in the care of these doctors for over four years for treatment of serious
psychiatric disturbance.  The doctors testified in a voir dire, on the
basis of an examination of her made the preceding evening, that the witness had
been actively hallucinating while giving evidence on the stand during the
trial.  Moreover, they testified that the nature of the hallucination was such
that it directly affected the truth of that testimony.  As is apparent, such
circumstances caused the case to fall squarely within the rule in Toohey.

 

                   However, such cases
are clearly exceptional and this jurisprudence does not permit the exploration
of the psychiatric history of a witness simply on the basis that the defence
hopes such material may be relevant or useful to impugn the witness's
testimony.  Nor does it require the trial judge to order the disclosure of the
complainant's medical records in order to permit the defence to attempt to
establish that a witness's evidence may be unreliable.  It is clear that the
rule in Toohey is intended to ensure that, when there are serious
concerns about the reliability of a witness due to mental or psychiatric
disturbance, there is a mechanism by which those concerns can be brought to
light at trial.  Furthermore, it is also clear that expert evidence is
permitted only for the limited purpose of establishing that some aspect of the
witness's condition may affect the reliability of the witness's testimony on
the issue in question; otherwise, such evidence, as both courts below found in
the present case, may be inadmissible.  Such evidence is not intended to
provide easy access to fishing expeditions on the part of the defence where the
psychiatric history of a witness may be marginal or totally irrelevant to the
issue to be decided.  Nor, in my opinion, can the rule in Toohey be used
to provide a method of gathering all sorts of other information which,
although, no doubt, of interest to the defence in its attempts to undermine the
credibility of the witness, would otherwise remain beyond its reach.

 

                   Moreover, this
jurisprudence does not mandate the disclosure of medical records to the defence
in order to allow it to establish the unreliability of a witness's testimony. 
In the event that the defence has established that, for example, because of the
demeanour or behaviour of a witness, such an investigation is crucial to the
fairness of the trial, the usual method would be, as was the case in Hawke,
to call evidence from the witness's own doctor to testify as to whether there
is anything in the nature of the witness's psychiatric or mental condition
which would bear specifically on her ability to give reliable evidence on the
matter in issue.

 

3.  Limitations on
Cross-examination

 

                   In my view, in the
event that disclosure is required, the limited purposes for which such evidence
is available in the first place indicate that restrictions on the scope of
cross-examination are also warranted.  However, my colleague Cory J. found
that, once a witness's medical records are admitted, cross-examination must
then be allowed on any information garnered from the records which may be
relevant to an issue in the case.  Although my colleague himself finds that
defence counsel's submissions as regards the purpose of cross-examination
appeared ""to be the very sort of improper purpose for which evidence
cannot be adduced"", (p. 673) he still finds that it was the duty of the
trial judge ""to permit cross-examination with regard to the July 9 record,
particularly to determine if it would throw any light either upon a possible
motive of the complainant to allege that she was the victim of sexual assault
or with regard to her conduct which might have led the appellant to believe
that she was consenting to sexual advances"" (pp. 673-74).  For the
following reasons, I disagree.

 

                   Medical records
only become relevant if there is serious reason to believe that the competence
to testify, which we normally presume in all adult witnesses, is in question. 
To the extent that such records are necessary to establish that the witness is
incapable of giving reliable testimony in relation to the specific matter in
issue, they remain relevant.  If the alleged unreliability cannot be
established, then, once again, the information in the records becomes
tangential and cross-examination on such information will be impermissible
simply on the grounds that it is either clearly irrelevant or too remote and of
scant probative value.

 

                   Given the
limitations on the exploration of a witness's particular mental or psychiatric
state I have discussed above in regards to Toohey and Hawke, in
my opinion it follows that cross-examination on the medical records that
extends beyond the scope of establishing the unreliability of the witness's
testimony due to that mental condition should also be curtailed.  In other
words, cross-examination on medical records must be restricted to the purpose
for which they were introduced.  The defence may not argue that, because the
medical records were relevant to the issue of the witness's competence to
testify or reliability as to the issue to be decided, it may then cross-examine
on all the information contained therein for whatever use it may be to the rest
of the defence's case.

 

                   There may be
instances, as in the present case, in which the defence argues that the records
contain information that is relevant to the issues to be decided.  In my
opinion, both on basic evidentiary principles and for the policy reasons which
I shall discuss below, cross-examination on such information should, except in
extraordinary cases, nonetheless remain impermissible.

 

                   In the words of
McCormick, supra, at p. 438, ""relevance is not always
enough"".  Trial judges possess the undoubted discretion to both exclude
evidence and limit cross-examination on matters which, although arguably
relevant to the issue, are outweighed by their potential to prejudice the trial
of the issue.  Central among these concerns are the following:  such facts may
unduly arouse sentiments of prejudice, hostility or sympathy; they may distract
the trier of fact from the main issue to be decided; and the exploration of the
issue may consume an undue amount of time.  (See also:  Wigmore on Evidence,
vol. 1A (Tillers rev. 1983), at p. 969.)

 

                   In my opinion, the
nature of medical records is such that all of these concerns would often be
engaged by unlimited cross-examination.  Such evidence is, in the vast majority
of cases, completely marginal to the central issue of the trial.  It may well invite
prejudice against the witness by the trier of fact.  Furthermore, the process
of proof and counterproof to establish the reliability of the evidence entails
large amounts of time and may potentially sidetrack the trial of the case.  For
these reasons, its prejudicial effect on the witness, and also in many cases on
the trial process itself, will, even in the event that the medical records are
relevant to the trial, outweigh its probative value.  More specifically,
particularly in the case of complainants in sexual assault trials, there is
serious risk that such information will be used to draw impermissible
inferences and encourage the trier of fact to rely on myths about the
credibility of sexual assault victims to the prejudice of both the witness and
the trial process.

 

4.  Policy Concerns
Regarding the Disclosure of Medical Records

 

                   As I have discussed
above, this Court has already acknowledged in Dyment, supra, that there
are serious dangers in the unrestricted use of information obtained in a doctor-patient
or other form of therapeutic relationship.  For the purposes of this
discussion, it is important to explore the following concerns as they pertain
to the initial disclosure of medical records and the limitations on
cross-examination subsequent to any disclosure.  These are but the most obvious
concerns; further research and information may very well disclose other
dangers.

 

                   First, common sense
dictates that if people are aware that medical records can and may very well be
obtained to attack the credibility of a witness, they may be reluctant to seek
needed and valuable treatment if there is any prospect that they may be
required to testify at trial, particularly if there is any connection between
the events at trial and the subjects of discussion in the treatment process. 
Few people are comfortable with the public disclosure of such information, and
many people may fear that such disclosure would not be entirely without effect
on other areas of their lives.

 

                   In addition,
routine disclosure of medical records and unrestricted cross-examination upon
disclosure threaten to function very unfairly against anyone who has undergone
mental or psychiatric therapy, whatever the precipitating event or nature of
the treatment, as compared to other members of the public.  Such persons would
be subject to an invasion of their privacy not suffered by other witnesses who
are required to testify.  They may have to answer to details of their personal
life reflected in their records and effectively overcome a presumption, most
often entirely unfounded, that their medical history is relevant to their
credibility and ability to testify on the matter in issue.

 

                   Moreover, medical
records concerning statements made in the course of therapy are both hearsay
and inherently problematic as regards reliability.  A witness's concerns
expressed in the course of therapy after the fact, even assuming they are
correctly understood and reliably noted, cannot be equated with evidence given
in the course of a trial.  Both the context in which the statements are made
and the expectations of the parties are entirely different.  In a trial, a
witness is sworn to testify as to the particular events in issue.  By contrast,
in therapy an entire spectrum of factors such as personal history, thoughts,
emotions as well as particular acts may inform the dialogue between therapist
and patient.  Thus, there is serious risk that such statements could be taken
piecemeal out of the context in which they were made to provide a foundation
for entirely unwarranted inferences by the trier of fact.

 

                   Finally,
credibility is an issue in many trials but particularly in trials involving
sexual assault.  In my view, if disclosure is accepted as relevant in such
cases, in any such trial, nothing will prevent any accused from requesting in
any case the medical and psychiatric records of the complainant and
cross-examining her on all matters in the record.

 

                   In light of these
concerns, courts must weigh carefully the cost of such disclosure, not only in
personal terms to the persons subject to disclosure orders or cross-examination
on information elicited from such records, but also to the effective
prosecution of the very issue at hand.  If the net result is to discourage
witnesses from reporting and coming forward with evidence, then, in my view, it
cannot be said that such practices would advance either the trial process
itself or enhance the general goals of the administration of justice.

 

                   In addition to
these general concerns which may affect all witnesses, in my opinion, it is
important to look at the specific position of the complainant in a sexual
assault trial.

 

5.  Sexual Assault

 

                   It is not without
significance that this challenge to the credibility of the witness has arisen
in the context of a sexual assault trial.  It has, since 1983, by reason of the
now s. 277  of the Criminal Code , been impermissible to challenge
the credibility of a complainant by adducing evidence about her sexual
reputation.  Moreover, Parliament has recently amended the Criminal Code 
(An Act to amend the Criminal Code (sexual assault), S.C. 1992,
c. 38, s. 2), to replace the former s. 276 of the Code
which was held unconstitutional by this Court in R. v. Seaboyer, [1991]
2 S.C.R. 577.  The former s. 276  prevented the accused, subject to a number of
exceptions, from adducing evidence of the complainant's sexual activity with
anyone other than the accused.  The amendments strongly evidence Parliament's
desire to instate guidelines to prevent the diversion of sexual assault trials
into inquiries into the moral character and past behaviour of the complainant. 
In my view, there is a real risk that the use of medical records may become the
means by which counsel indirectly bring evidence concerning the complainant
before the trier of fact which they are no longer permitted to do directly. 
Moreover, because of the beliefs which have typically informed notions of
relevance and credibility in sexual assault trials, the mere existence of
challenges to credibility on mental or psychiatric grounds in a sexual assault
trial raises serious questions about the persistence of rape myths.

 

                   Historically, a
host of factors were deemed relevant to the credibility of complainants in
sexual assault trials that did not bear on the credibility of witnesses in any
other trial and which functioned to the prejudice of victims of sexual
assault.  In Seaboyer, supra, I discussed at length the hurdles that
complainants faced in sexual assault trials due to these unfounded
presumptions.  They include myths that deem certain types of women
""unrapable"" and others, because of their occupations or previous
sexual history, unworthy of belief.  These myths suggest that women by their
behaviour or appearance may be responsible for the occurrence of sexual
assault.  They suggest that drug use or dependence on social assistance are
relevant to the issue of credibility as to consent.  They suggest that the
presence of certain emotional reactions and immediate reporting of the assault,
despite all of the barriers that might discourage such reports, lend
credibility to the assault report, whereas the opposite reactions lead to the
conclusion that the complainant must be fabricating the event.  Furthermore,
they are built on the suggestion that women, out of spite, fickleness or
fantasy and despite the obvious trauma for victims in many, if not most, sexual
assault trials, are inclined to lie about sexual assault.  The net result has
been that sexual assaults are, and continue to be, underreported and
underprosecuted; furthermore, the level of convictions that result in those
cases that do reach the courts is significantly lower than for other offences.

 

                   It is against this
backdrop that challenges to the credibility of sexual assault victims on
psychiatric grounds must be examined.  There is absolutely no evidence to
suggest that false allegations are more common in sexual assaults than in other
offences; indeed, given the data indicating the strong disincentives to
reporting, it seems much more likely that the opposite is true.  Nonetheless,
myths about the extraordinary need for caution with respect to the credibility
of complainants continue to play a role in the prosecution of sexual assaults. 
To illustrate their persistence, it is only necessary to point out that, apart
from cases of sexual assault, it is rare to encounter a suggestion that the
psychiatric history of a witness is at all relevant to the trial of the issue. 
Moreover, trial judges are normally unlikely to even entertain such submissions
unless the defence is able to conclusively establish beforehand that an inquiry
into a witness's medical history is crucial to the determination of the issue
at bar.

 

                   In the face of such
practices, the question that must be asked then is, why are medical records
deemed, or more likely to be deemed, both relevant and necessary in sexual
assault trials?

 

                   Relevance is
typically described in such terms as ""whatever accords with common
sense"" (P. K. McWilliams, Canadian Criminal Evidence (3rd ed.
1988), at p. 11-32) or that which is ""logically probative"" of the
matter in issue, the definition adopted by this Court in Morris v. The Queen,
[1983] 2 S.C.R. 190.  While we may, at first blush, think that the question of
the relevance of evidence is a relatively straightforward matter to determine,
as I stated in Seaboyer, supra, at pp. 679-80:

 

                   Whatever
the test, be it one of experience, common sense or logic, it is a decision
particularly vulnerable to the application of private beliefs.  Regardless of
the definition used, the content of any relevancy decision will be filled by
the particular judge's experience, common sense and/or logic.  For the most
part there will be general agreement as to that which is relevant and the
determination will not be problematic.  However, there are certain areas of
inquiry where experience, common sense and logic are informed by stereotype and
myth.  As I have made clear, this area of the law has been particularly prone
to the utilization of stereotype in determinations of relevance and again, as
was demonstrated earlier, this appears to be the unfortunate concomitant of a
society which, to a large measure, holds these beliefs.  It would also
appear that recognition of the large role that stereotype may play in such
determinations has had surprisingly little impact in this area of the law. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   Despite the fact
that there is much wider recognition, both among those involved in the
administration of justice and among the public at large, that unfounded beliefs
about sexual assault victims prejudicially affect both the victims and the
trial of the issue, their force and effect has not been eliminated.  Of their
very nature, beliefs will inform notions of relevance.  However, as they often
function unconsciously, their effect can be unacknowledged and identifying them
may be a difficult and elusive process.  In recognition of this fact,
Parliament, in the amendments to the Criminal Code , has now expressly
directed the judge to take into account, in determining whether evidence should
be admissible, the following matters:

 

                   276. ...

 

                   (3)  In
determining whether evidence is admissible under subsection (2), the judge,
provincial court judge or justice shall take into account

 

                                                                    ...

 

(b)  society's
interest in encouraging the reporting of sexual assault offenses;

 

                                                                    ...

 

(d)  the
need to remove from the fact-finding process any discriminatory belief or bias;

 

(e)  the
risk that the evidence may unduly arouse sentiments of prejudice, sympathy or
hostility in the jury;

 

(f)  the
potential prejudice to the complainant's personal dignity and right of privacy;

 

(g)  the
right of the complainant and of every individual to personal security and to
the full protection and benefit of the law;

 

                   Because of this, in
my view, evidence which normally lies outside the purview of the trial process
but is deemed relevant to the credibility of sexual assault complainants must
be carefully, and perhaps sceptically, scrutinized.  In my opinion, the best
way to examine the question of relevance is to place the proposed use of
psychiatric evidence in the circumstances of the ordinary trial.

 

                   Credibility is a
central issue in many criminal cases.  Moreover, the entire trial process is
structured to provide the trier of fact with opportunities to assess the
veracity of witnesses.  However, as I have discussed above, the competence of
witnesses to testify is normally presumed and challenges to the reliability of
evidence on the basis of the mental or psychiatric condition of the witness
rarely form part of the trial process.  Unless we are to resurrect, consciously
or unconsciously, the myth that complainants in sexual assault trials are
inherently more untrustworthy than witnesses in any other trial where
credibility is an issue, challenges to a witness's testimony on mental or
psychiatric grounds must be measured against the same standard of relevance in
sexual assault trials as in the trial of any other offence.  Thus, even a
request, let alone an order, for the production of a complainant's medical
records should be an extraordinary event.

 

                   Moreover, the costs
to both the witnesses and the trial process of both admitting medical records
and permitting cross-examination of the complainant by the defence on the
material contained in them must be clearly confronted.  In my opinion, for the
following reasons, the inescapable conclusion is that such practices would only
frustrate further our still inadequate attempts to extend to victims of sexual
assault the protection of the justice system to which they are entitled.

 

                   One of the most
powerful disincentives to reporting sexual assaults is women's fear of further
victimization at the hands of the criminal justice system; as I discussed in Seaboyer,
supra, at p. 650, almost half of unreported incidents may be traced to
this perception on the part of sexual assault victims.  With good reason, women
have come to believe that their reports will not be taken seriously by police
and that the trial process itself will be yet another experience of trauma.  It
must be obvious that if, in addition to the current disincentives, such victims
face the revelation of intimate details of their lives via the release of their
medical records, the disincentive to reporting could only increase.

 

                   Two alternatives
seem likely. If victims of sexual assaults feared that their medical records
could be deemed relevant to the assault, then they may very well make the
decision to forego medical treatment if they intend to report the assault or if
charges are already outstanding.  Those that did undergo treatment may be
reluctant to fully disclose information out of fear that such information might
be used against them, either in the trial or, because of the public nature of
the trial process, in other areas of their lives.  Such a decision may very
well prevent a discussion of matters that are vital to both the course of
therapy and their ultimate well-being.

 

                   On the other hand,
victims who choose to undergo therapy, as well as those for whom therapy is
essential for their very survival, would be less likely to come forward with
complaints about the assaults.  This, of necessity, would lead to lack of
prosecution and conviction in such cases and may, in turn, result in both
continued victimization and increased risk of assault to other potential
victims.

 

                   Furthermore, the
nature of therapy is such that mere disclosure itself could be prejudicial to
the health of the witness.

 

                   Indeed, recent
reports indicate some support for these very concerns.  As a consequence of
recent decisions in both Nova Scotia (R. v. Ross (1993), 121 N.S.R. (2d)
242 (C.A.), leave to appeal to Supreme Court of Canada refused, [1993] 3 S.C.R.
viii) and British Columbia (R. v. O'Connor (1992), 18 C.R. (4th) 98
(S.C.)), groups representing, among others, both victims of sexual assault and
disabled persons have expressed serious concern about these very outcomes (The
Globe and Mail, May 15, 1993, at p. D3, and July 15, 1993, at p. A7; and
the Calgary Herald, July 16, 1993, at p. A12).

 

                   Ironically, then, a
procedure justified by the accused's right to full answer and defence risks
frustrating the object of protecting victims of sexual assault by becoming the
means by which offenders escape prosecution.

 

                   It must be recalled
that experts called by the defence in their attempts to impugn the reliability
of the complainant are entitled and expected to discuss the foundations of
their opinions.  Under such circumstances, it seems impossible to prevent the
disclosure of information from the medical records about the witness's
behaviour and background which, although irrelevant to the issues, because of
the persistence of beliefs about sexual assault victims, may unfairly prejudice
the complainant in the eyes of the jury.  This, in turn, may prejudice the
trial by diverting the focus of the jury to the character of the complainant
and away from consideration of the narrow issue before it, the question of the
assault.

 

                   In my view, to
ensure against such consequences, victims of sexual assault must be secure
beforehand in knowing that their medical records will be unavailable to the
defence.

 

Conclusion

 

                   I would conclude,
then, that the compulsion to disclose such records may only occur where there
is serious reason to believe that, absent such disclosure, a miscarriage of
justice is likely.  Given the premium placed on the confidentiality of medical
records in our society, and the high degree of prejudice to the witness caused
by delving into psychiatric records, in my view, such records should only be
disclosed when there is cogent evidence to suggest that: the competence of the
witness to testify is in serious doubt or the witness's testimony with respect
to the particular issue to be decided is unreliable because of the witness's
medical condition; and furthermore, that without such disclosure, there would
be serious prejudice to the accused's right to make full answer and defence. 
Mere suggestion, speculation or possibility raised on the part of the defence,
as is the case here, that such records may be relevant cannot be sufficient.

 

                   Because the issue
of disclosure was not argued in this case and remains to be fully canvassed by
this Court, I refrain from a more specific discussion of what must ordinarily
be established to meet this threshold at this time.

 

                   However, in the
event that medical records are released to the defence, in my view, their use
must be limited to the specific purpose for which they were released.  In other
words, their use is limited to establishing that the witness's testimony is, by
reason of a medical condition, unreliable.  The defence may not ordinarily make
further use of the records to obtain evidence on other issues to be decided. 
While there may be instances in which, because the evidence revealed is both
directly relevant to the matter in issue and carries high probative value and
inability to make further use of such information may lead to a miscarriage of
justice, such instances will be rare indeed and even then, for the reasons
which I have discussed above, defence counsel may not use these records to
obtain information with which to impugn the credibility of the witness
generally.  Medical records, particularly psychiatric records, potentially
provide a gold mine of material for defence lawyers in this regard.  Therefore,
in the extraordinary event that medical records are admitted into evidence,
courts must take particular care in the case of sexual assault trials that
medical records are not used to confront complainants about past sexual history
or invoke rape mythology by raising issues which might be perceived by the
trier of fact as establishing the ""bad character"" of the complainant,
which is precisely what the defence here alleged:  ""what kind of person
the complainant is"".

 

                   In conclusion, I
feel compelled to point out that the defence normally has no access to the
medical records of a witness.  Unless we are prepared to accept the argument
that access to medical records is to be provided in every case in which
credibility is an issue (which, for reasons of relevance, we do not), I fail to
see how the inability to access this information, or to fully cross-examine the
complainant on these records, prevents the accused from making full answer and
defence.  Such an argument would imply an entitlement on the part of the
accused to virtually unrestricted latitude to expand the focus of the trial. 
The rights of the accused to both adduce evidence and cross-examine are not
unlimited but must be first, circumscribed by the question of relevance and
second, balanced by countervailing factors such as the privacy interests of the
witness and the prejudice to both the witness and the trial process.

 

Application to the
Case

 

                   In the present
case, counsel to the appellant originally sought disclosure of the
complainant's entire medical record and full cross-examination on all of the
complainant's psychiatric problems, all her medication and all her
counselling.  Prior to disclosure, counsel freely admitted that he did not know
what he would find and that the records might not supply him with anything of
assistance, but he nonetheless claimed that they were necessary to make full
answer and defence.  The trial judge was apparently of the view that, because
it was possible that the complainant might be suffering from a severe
psychiatric illness, her medical records should be disclosed.

 

                   In my opinion,
there is nothing in the record of this case to suggest that there were
sufficient grounds to warrant an order for the disclosure of the records to the
defence in the first place.  The issue was the narrow one of consent to sexual
relations with the appellant on the day in question.  There was no evidence
that the complainant was incapable of giving reliable testimony in general, let
alone reliable testimony as to the particular issue to be decided.  Rather, the
opposite was true.  The complainant was able to, and did give, prior to the
order for disclosure, a clear, full and detailed account of the events. 
Nothing prevented the defence from conducting a full cross-examination of the
complainant as to those events.

 

                   In addition, there
was absolutely no evidence that the complainant was in fact suffering from a
condition that would affect her capacity to give reliable testimony; the only
evidence was that she had been admitted to the psychiatric ward on several
occasions because of difficulties with her family and problems related to low
self-esteem.  Moreover, the complainant herself had already admitted her
psychiatric history prior to the release of her medical records.  Thus, there
was no evidence of a ""hidden defect"" in her mental condition that
necessitated revelation by psychiatric testimony.

 

                   However, given the
trial judge's understanding that he was required to order the disclosure of the
complainant's medical records, in my opinion, it was not only proper but
essential for him to restrict the purposes for which they could be used.  Nor
did the trial judge err in concluding that the privacy of the complainant was
an important value which should play a role in determining the scope of the use
of the medical records.  Finally, the trial judge was entirely correct in
refusing to allow the defence to cross-examine on the records to attempt to
elicit information to establish the defence of mistaken belief in consent.  The
evidence in the medical records was, of necessity, totally irrelevant and
without any probative value as regards this issue.

 

                   Despite the
production of the medical records, the appellant was unable to establish via
the complainant's doctor or its own expert witness that the complainant
suffered from some defect of the mind that prevented her from reliably
testifying as to consent to sexual relations on that day.  The appellant's
counsel cross-examined the complainant's own psychiatrist, Dr. MacTavish, in a voir
dire on the basis of those records.  However, Dr. MacTavish rejected the
proposition that the complainant suffered from a personality disorder and, when
asked directly about it by the trial judge, expressly stated that he thought
her evidence was capable of being relied upon at face value.

 

                   However, once the
appellant was in possession of the medical records, he then argued that,
because the records were allowed in, he should be permitted unrestricted
cross-examination on them to challenge the credibility of the complainant as to
the issue of consent.  For the reasons I have discussed, in my view the trial
judge's discussion to prevent the cross-examination was correct.  Moreover, it
is clear that the appellant intended to use these records to establish the very
sort of prejudice to the complainant which informs rape myths.

 

                   In my opinion, once
the appellant was unable to establish that the complainant was unable to give
reliable testimony, the trial judge was entirely correct in finding that this
was the end of any use of her medical records in the trial.

 

                   Contrary to the
finding of the Court of Appeal, we do have a record, drawn from the submissions
of the appellant's counsel which preceded the disclosure order and those
preceding the ruling on the cross-examination, of the questions and line of
inquiry that the defence intended to pursue in cross-examining the complainant
on her medical records.  Counsel to the appellant frankly admitted that he
wanted to adduce evidence concerning her parents' reaction to the assault
because ""that relates directly to what kind of person the complainant
is"".  Moreover, the cross-examination of her psychiatrist, Dr. MacTavish,
on those records in the voir dire also clearly reveals the manner in
which the appellant regarded the material as relevant.  Both sources disclose
that the defence intended to use the information gained from the record to wage
a wide-ranging attack on the credibility of the complainant and establish her
""bad character"".  This is evident in the voir dire of Dr.
MacTavish, in which the defence raised such issues as her past use of drugs and
alcohol, difficulties in social relations, previous history of sexual relations,
and fights with her mother.  I can only conclude that the defence hoped to use
expert testimony on the medical records to invite the jury to draw inferences
about the credibility of the complainant based on, among other things, her past
sexual history.  These are precisely the inferences based upon myths which work
to the prejudice of complainants in sexual assault and which Parliament, in its
amendments to the law governing sexual assault, has attempted to prevent.

 

                   As to the proposed
cross-examination of the complainant, in his submissions before this Court, the
appellant urged that the July 9th notation in the complainant's medical record,
to the effect that she was concerned that her behaviour may have influenced the
appellant's behaviour, was relevant to the defences of consent and mistaken
belief in consent.  He also contended that entries in her medical records
indicating that she had a turbulent relationship with her parents were relevant
to the defence theory that she made up the allegations of the assault to avoid
a confrontation with her parents after she had been out all night.

 

                   With regard to the
July 9th notation, I am unable to see how this statement, four and a half
months after the incident, can be at all relevant to the issues of consent or
the appellant's mistaken belief in consent at the time.  The complainant's
reflections on how the situation might have been avoided, even assuming they
are correct, can have no probative value as to whether or not there was consent
to the assault or mistaken belief in consent on the part of the appellant.  In
any event, it is hardly surprising that such statements are to be found in her
medical records; in this, as in other traumatic situations such as the death of
a loved one, especially by suicide, it is not uncommon for people to blame
themselves for the event.  It is well-known that victims of sexual assault in
particular often feel responsible for not having done enough to prevent the
attack.

 

                   Furthermore, as the
Court of Appeal noted in its reasons, there is no evidence that the medical
record contained any prior inconsistent statements relevant to the
complainant's testimony on the issue of consent.  The trial judge, who heard
all of the evidence and read all of the medical records, was unable to find any
relevance to the proposed cross-examination and accordingly refused to permit
the cross-examination.  Nor does the appellant allege that the records contain
prior inconsistent statements.  In my opinion, the appellant clearly has not
established that he has been prevented from making full answer and defence by
the trial judge's ruling that he may not cross-examine the complainant on her
psychiatric records.

 

                   On the issue of
consent, the jury already had the benefit of the complainant's direct testimony
as to the events themselves and the absence of the complainant's consent.  She
was cross-examined extensively on this issue.  In addition, the appellant also
testified as to his ""expectations"" about what would happen. 
Therefore, there was no need to resort to second hand reports in the medical
records and no reason to believe that anything would be gained by questioning
her further on this point, particularly as the appellant would have been bound
by her answers on this collateral issue.

 

                   As to the issue of
the accused's honest but mistaken belief in consent, the complainant's thoughts
about the assault after the fact are completely irrelevant.  The defence of
mistaken belief in consent, as opposed to the defence of consent, normally only
arises where the complainant and the accused tell essentially the same story
about what occurred but differ in their interpretations as to whether the
activity in question amounted to consent (see Director of Public
Prosecutions v. Morgan, [1976] A.C. 182 (H.L.), and Pappajohn v. The
Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120).  In the present case, any mistake of
perception or interpretation that might have existed was a matter located
solely in the mind of the appellant; nothing in the subsequent comments of the
complainant could add to, detract from, or have any relevance to presence or
absence of that belief at the time.

 

                   The material in the
medical records concerning the complainant's relationship with her parents is
also completely irrelevant to the issue of whether she was assaulted.  Thus,
any cross-examination in this area would be impermissible.  But, in any event,
the jury was already aware of the complainant's difficulties with her parents
and the theory of the defence that she invented the story of the assault to
avoid repercussions with her parents.  Again, there is no evidence that further
cross-examination on this issue would have had any effect on the outcome of the
trial.

 

                   In summary,
important as cross-examination is, and I agree with Cory J. on this, I
cannot agree that the appellant was denied the opportunity to make full answer
and defence because he was unable to cross-examine the complainant on her
medical record.  There is nothing to suggest that the material in the records
for this proposed cross-examination was anything other than irrelevant to the
issue of her consent to the assault.  Moreover, it is obvious that it would
have been highly prejudicial and that its purpose was to attack the credibility
of the complainant in a general way by putting before the jury every difficulty
in her personal life in the hope that they would then draw negative inferences
about her character and credibility.  Cross-examination for this purpose is
clearly impermissible; furthermore, it could only have prejudiced the trial by
distracting the jury from the narrow issue of consent to the assault on that
particular event.

 

Disposition

 

                   In the result, I
find that s. 265(4)  of the Criminal Code  is constitutional and,
like McLachlin J., I would dismiss the appeal.

 

                   The reasons of La
Forest, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. were delivered by

 

                   McLachlin
J. (dissenting) -- This
appeal raises two issues -- the question of what must be established before the
judge may put the defence of honest but mistaken belief to the jury in a case
of sexual assault and the question of when cross-examination on sensitive
medical records should be allowed in such a case.  Both are issues of great
importance, not only to the proper development of the criminal law, but also to
the proper prosecution of one of the most serious maladies that afflicts our
society, sexual assault.

 

                   While I agree with
much of what my colleagues Cory J. and L'Heureux-Dubé J. say, I take a somewhat
different approach to each of the two issues raised on this appeal.  In the
end, I would dismiss this appeal substantially for the reasons given by the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia.

 

                   The facts have been
detailed by my colleagues.  On some things, the evidence is uncontradicted. 
There is no dispute that the two accused, Osolin and McCallum, went to the
complainant's trailer and entered her bedroom after having been told she was ""easy"". 
There is no dispute that their intention was to have sexual intercourse with
her.  There is no dispute that Smith, the man she was with, was driven away. 
There is no dispute that Osolin carried the complainant out of the trailer and
that she was protesting as he did so.  There is no dispute that she was driven
40 miles to a remote cabin, where McCallum, the driver, left Osolin and the
complainant.  There is no dispute that Osolin tied the complainant up,
spread-eagled on the bed, and then had sexual intercourse with her.  There is
no dispute that the complainant was found crying and hysterical on the highway
at 3:30 a.m. in the morning, nor that she told the police that she had been
raped.  There is no dispute that her hysteria continued, and that she was taken
to hospital.  Finally, there is no dispute that her physical condition,
including a bruised wrist and bruising and discoloration to the pubic area, was
more consistent with resistance and rape than with consensual intercourse. 
Additionally, the complainant's version of the struggle was confirmed by the
discovery of her underpants about 20 feet from the trailer, where she said they
had been torn off her after she was placed in the back seat of the car that
took her to the remote cabin.  The appellant admitted that the complainant made
some protests over the course of the evening (C.O.A., at p. 471), that he
overrode her complaints about her nakedness (C.O.A., at p. 497) and that he
tends to adopt the attitude that ""no"" means ""yes"" until
there is a clear indication of no consent (C.O.A., at p. 509).

 

                   On the issue of
consent, the complainant's and Osolin's stories diverged entirely.  The
complainant maintained that she never consented to the abduction, and resisted
as best she could throughout the long ordeal.  Osolin, on the other hand,
maintains that she was a willing participant in the night's events.

 

                   Osolin was charged
with sexual assault and kidnapping.  McCallum was charged with kidnapping. 
Osolin's defence, as revealed by his evidence, McCallum's evidence, and the
nature of the cross-examination of the complainant, was that the complainant
had consented.  The theory of the defence was that the complainant had in fact
consented to the sexual abduction and acts, and had fabricated the story that she
had not consented after the fact to avoid confrontation with her parents. 
Osolin did not specifically deny that he had forcibly confined the complainant
by taking her out of the trailer or having her driven to the cabin.  He
testified, however, that she seemed to be going along with things, albeit
passively, and said in cross-examination that he had no doubt that everything
that took place in the cabin took place by consent (C.O.A., at p. 458).  The
burden of his evidence was that the complainant had in fact consented; he never
addressed the question of whether he might merely have had an honest belief in
her consent, even though she did not consent.

 

                   The trial judge,
while leaving it open to the jury to find that the complainant had consented,
refused to leave with them the defence that Osolin had an honest but mistaken
belief that she had consented, on the ground that the evidence did not give
that defence an ""air of reality"" as required by the law.  The jury
convicted him of kidnapping and sexual assault and he was sentenced to six
years in prison.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal sustained the
conviction:  (1991), 7 B.C.A.C. 181, 15 W.A.C. 181, 10 C.R. (4th) 159.  Osolin
now appeals to this Court.

 

Analysis

 

Restriction of Cross-examination

 

                   The complainant
spent time in psychiatric care before and after the events at issue on the
trial.  Osolin's counsel sought and was granted production of her medical
records for the purpose of permitting an expert to consider the complainant's
competence to testify under oath.  The validity of the order for production is
not in issue on these proceedings.

 

                   Osolin's counsel
sought leave to cross-examine the complainant on these records, and in
particular on an entry to the effect that the complainant, subsequent to the
events in issue, had expressed concern to her doctor ""that her attitude
and behaviour may have influenced the man to some extent"" and that she was
""having second thoughts about the entire case"".  Osolin's counsel
told the judge that the purpose of the cross-examination was to show ""what
kind of person the complainant is"".

 

                   I agree with my
colleague Cory J.'s review of the principles governing the decision of the
trial judge whether to permit cross-examination on matters such as this.  I
also agree with the emphasis my colleague L'Heureux-Dubé J. places both on the
discretionary nature of the judge's decision where the evidence relates to the
prior sexual conduct of the complainant, and on the caution which a court must
exercise in permitting examination on matters like the complainant's
background, which may have little or no relevance to the actual issues and at
the same time may unduly prejudice her reputation and privacy.  Moreover, as
pointed out by my colleague L'Heureux‑Dubé J., there may be special
dangers associated with the use of psychiatric evidence in cross‑examination. 
The rule is clear.  Before cross-examination can be allowed on a complainant's
prior sexual conduct, the defence must demonstrate that the cross-examination
possesses ""a degree of relevance which outweighs the damages and
disadvantages presented by the admission of such evidence"":  R. v.
Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 634.

 

                   This then was the
task of the trial judge.  Faced with the application for cross-examination, he
had to determine whether the defence had demonstrated a potential relevance to
the cross-examination capable of outweighing the damage and invasion of privacy
it might cause to the complainant.  To be satisfied that the threshold of
relevance is met, the trial judge, as I said in Seaboyer (at
p. 634), ""must ensure that evidence is tendered for a legitimate
purpose, and that it logically supports a defence"". I specifically
added:  ""The fishing expeditions which unfortunately did occur in the
past should not be permitted."" (Emphasis added.)

 

                   In order to meet
this test, the accused must demonstrate that the cross-examination is directed
at a ""legitimate purpose"", at a specific defence.  Here counsel for
the accused failed to do this.  The only purpose he gave for wanting to
cross-examine on the medical record was to show ""what kind of person the
complainant is"".  As Cory J. states, this is the very sort of improper
purpose for which evidence cannot be adduced under the principles which
this Court adopted in Seaboyer, and that without something more,
""the trial judge was correct in refusing to permit cross-examination for
that purpose"" (p. 673).

 

                   The question then
is whether this ""something more"" was shown in this case.  Counsel for
Osolin did not offer anything more; his only purpose on the record was to
discredit the complainant's character.

 

                   But it is argued
that counsel's failure to adduce a relevant reason for the cross-examination
does not end the inquiry imposed on the trial judge.  It is suggested that the
judge has an independent duty to examine the material available for
cross-examination and to ensure that any relevant avenues for impeachment of
the complainant which counsel for the accused may have overlooked are
explored.   It is further said that the trial judge failed to discharge this
duty.  He should, it is suggested, have insisted that cross-examination take
place on the notation in question, not with a view to what it might show about
the complainant's character, but rather for the purpose of showing that the
complainant might have had a motive to falsely allege that she was the victim
of a sexual assault, as well as on the question of whether she did anything
which might have led Osolin to believe that she was consenting to his sexual
advances.  Accordingly, it is argued, there must be a new trial.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
rejected this submission.  Southin J.A., for the court, held that the failure
of counsel to raise a valid reason for the cross-examination was fatal to this
ground of appeal.  My colleague Cory J., on the other hand, accepts this
submission.  Respectfully, I find myself in Southin J.A.'s camp.

 

                   My colleague Cory
J. (at p. 673) states that ""quite apart from the submissions of the
defence counsel, it is the duty of the trial judge to ensure that the accused's
rights with regard to cross-examination, which are so essential to the defence,
are protected"".  This statement seems to me to pose two difficulties.

 

                   The first
difficulty is the implication that, contrary to the rule set out in Seaboyer,
the onus will no longer lie solely upon the accused to establish a legitimate
purpose for the cross-examination.  Instead, where defence counsel fails to
demonstrate a legitimate purpose, the onus may now shift to the trial judge to
determine independently whether there are any potential grounds for a
legitimate cross-examination.

 

                   The second
difficulty lies in what would follow upon a judicial determination that
potential grounds for legitimate cross-examination remain to be explored.  Cory
J. (at p. 673) says in such circumstances it is ""appropriate to permit
cross-examination"".  (Emphasis added.)  But it is not a matter of permitting,
since counsel has not requested the cross-examination for the legitimate
purpose.  In a case like this, where counsel has not requested permission to
cross-examine on the matters which are legitimate, two options would seem to be
open to the judge if he or she is to discharge his or her duty ""to ensure
that the accused's rights with regard to cross-examination, which are so
essential to the defence, are protected"".  First, the judge could direct
counsel to cross-examine on the untouched matter for the proper purpose.  (It
would seem insufficient to merely suggest such cross-examination, since if
counsel declined, that would not ensure that the accused's rights are
protected.)  Second, the trial judge could himself undertake the omitted
cross-examination.  Both alternatives are fraught with difficulty.  On the
first, the trial judge usurps the right of counsel (and impliedly the accused)
to conduct the case as they see fit.  On the second, the trial judge finds
himself drawn into the role of counsel.

 

                   It is my view that
to place a duty on a trial judge to ensure that all legitimate grounds of
cross-examination are explored is inconsistent with the nature of our trial
process and would confuse and complicate the prosecution of criminal offences
unduly.  Our criminal trial system is essentially adversarial.  The Crown puts
forward evidence directed to showing that the accused is guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt.  The accused points out weaknesses in the Crown's case and
sometimes offers contrary evidence.  The court, comprised of judge and jury,
sits as neutral arbiter, charged with deciding, whether, at the close of all
the evidence, the Crown has proven the accused guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt.

 

                   The dangers of the
judge abandoning the traditional role of neutral adjudicator have often been
confirmed.  The general rule has emerged that while judges may ask questions of
clarification and amplification, they need not, indeed should not, take the
case out of the hands of competent counsel and into their own hands:  Boran
v. Wenger, [1942] O.W.N. 185 (C.A.); R. v. Ignat (1965), 53 W.W.R.
248 (Man. C.A.); Majcenic v. Natale, [1968] 1 O.R. 189 (C.A.); and Jones
v. National Coal Board, [1957] 2 All E.R. 155 (C.A.).  Indeed, trial judges
have been criticized and verdicts overturned precisely because judges have
entered the arena and subjected the accused to their own cross-examination:  Brouillard
v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 39; R. v. Turlon (1989), 49 C.C.C.
(3d) 186 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Valley (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 207 (Ont.
C.A.), leave to appeal to Supreme Court of Canada refused, [1986] 1 S.C.R.
xiii.

 

                   A number of
considerations support this view of the proper role of the trial judge.  First,
the judge must not only be impartial; he or she must appear to be impartial; R.
v. Sussex Justices; Ex parte McCarthy, [1924] 1 K.B. 256, at p. 259. 
A judge who takes up the role of counsel, whether for the Crown or for the
defence, risks giving the appearance of partiality and courts the danger of
psychological identification with the successful answers he or she elicits.

 

                   A second risk is
that judicial intervention may harm the case for the defence.  Defence counsel
may have good reason for leaving untouched an area of cross-examination which
may seem to be a fertile ground for exploration to a trial judge who lacks the
opportunities available to counsel of exploring and considering the
implications of raising the issue.  In Yuill v. Yuill, [1945] 1 All E.R.
183 (C.A.), cited with approval in Brouillard, supra, Lord Greene M.R.
explained, at p. 185 that:  ""It must always be borne in mind that the
judge does not know what is in counsel's brief and has not the same facilities
as counsel for an effective examination-in-chief or cross-examination"".

 

                   Finally, it is
questionable whether the efficient conduct of trials supports mandatory
judicial intervention on cross-examination where counsel fails to explore
potential areas of cross-examination.  The trial judge already bears the heavy
burden of running the trial in a fair and expeditious manner and listening to
and evaluating the evidence.  In a jury trial, he or she assumes the additional
burden of ensuring that the jury is properly instructed.  To add to this the
duty to review potential areas of cross-examination which counsel has left
untouched would place upon the trial judge yet another task, that of counsel --
counsel, moreover, for both parties.  The task might be time-consuming, as the
present case illustrates.  The medical records filed in the case at bar
consisted of approximately 100 pages of reports.  If the appellant is correct,
the trial judge must examine all of these pages to see whether there may be
some entry which might be a ground for cross-examination supportive of the
defence.  Presumably, in fairness, the judge would be obliged to do the same
with respect to the Crown's case.  Bearing these implications in mind, it seems
to me that the only fair and practical rule is to leave it to counsel to choose
the cross-examination upon which they will embark.  The judge may ask questions
by way of clarification and amplification.  But he or she is not to be faulted
for having failed to insist upon the cross-examination of an area which counsel
has chosen to leave fallow.

 

                   My colleague Cory
J. suggests that a court of appeal confronted by an unexplored avenue of
cross-examination which might have led to a reasonable doubt as to guilt should
direct a new trial to avoid a miscarriage of justice. Accepting for the
purposes of this point that a court of appeal is bound to direct a new trial
where it appears that counsel has chosen not to canvas a crucial point in
cross-examination which might lead to a miscarriage of justice, I do not see
this as such a case.  It was argued that cross-examination on the notation in
question might have led to an admission by the complainant that she fabricated
the story of sexual assault to avoid confrontation with her parents.  I agree
with Southin J.A. in the Court of Appeal that to the extent that the evidence
elicited might have had some slight evidentiary value with respect to the
defence's theory that she had fabricated the story to avoid confrontation with
her parents, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice can be said to have
occurred.  There was ample evidence before the jury of the difficult
relationship that existed between the complainant and her parents and their
disapproval of some of her conduct.  

 

                   Before us, it was
argued that cross-examination might also have supported the alternative theory
that the accused honestly but mistakenly believed the complainant consented. 
There is a question, as my colleague L'Heureux-Dubé J. points out, as to the
importance of any answers that might have been elicited, given the
well-documented phenomenon of victim guilt in cases such as these.  In any
event, it is far from clear that answers favourable to the accused on this
point would have made any difference to the jury's verdict in the context of
all the evidence of the case.  In this connection, I note that the trial judge
permitted one Bragg to be cross-examined as to what he told Osolin about the
complainant's engaging in sexual activity with one Dick the day of the events
at issue.  He also ruled that the complainant could be cross-examined as to her
sexual activity on that day.  In short, there was already a great deal of
negative evidence before the jury about the complainant's ""attitude and
behaviour"" on the day in question.  In these circumstances, I find it
impossible to conclude that defence counsel's failure to cross-examine on these
same matters entitles Osolin to a new trial.

 

                   In assessing
whether the trial judge should have intervened, it must be borne in mind that
this line of questioning would have contradicted the theory of the defence at
trial.  The defence, as characterized by Osolin's evidence and his counsel's
cross-examination of the complainant, was directed to showing that the
complainant was a willing participant in the evening's events and had made up
the story of abduction and sexual assault after the event to avoid confrontation
with her parents.  Questioning about whether the complainant, while not
consenting, might have acted in a way which could have led Osolin to believe
that she was consenting, would have contradicted the theory of the defence. 
This may explain why counsel may have chosen not to cross-examine on this
point.  He wanted to cross-examine for the purpose of showing the complainant's
bad character, a purpose consistent with the theory that she had consented to
Osolin's acts and was lying when she said otherwise.  But he apparently did not
wish to cross-examine on the contrary thesis that she had not consented, but
that Osolin honestly but mistakenly believed that she had.  Nor, presumably,
would he have wished the trial judge to intervene to conduct an examination on
that subject.  To pursue this line of cross-examination would have been to put
before the jury a version of events which he was urging the jury to reject.

 

                   Having chosen to
conduct his case as he saw best at the time, Osolin comes to this Court and
asks for a new trial so that he can explore alternative avenues which he
thought it best to eschew at the time, pleading that failure to grant him this
new trial will amount to a fundamental miscarriage of justice.  I cannot
agree.  An accused is entitled to a trial, in which he may cross-examine on as
many defences as he chooses.  He is not entitled to a series of trials,
exploring one theory on one and another on a second.

 

                   For these reasons,
I would not order a new trial on the ground of denial of cross-examination.

 

Honest but Mistaken
Belief in Consent and the Air of Reality Test

 

                   Different defences
may be raised to a charge of sexual assault.  One is that the physical acts
complained of never occurred.  That defence was not raised here.  Another is
that while the acts occurred, the complainant consented to them.  This was the
theory of the defence in the case at bar.  A third is that while the acts
occurred and the complainant did not consent to them, the accused entertained
an honest but mistaken belief that she was consenting.  As such, he did not
possess the necessary subjective mens rea or guilty mind to support a
conviction.

 

                   As my colleagues
point out, before any defence can be put to the jury, the evidence must provide
a basis for that defence.  This requirement is sometimes described by saying
that there must be an ""air of reality"" to the defence.  To put a
defence to the jury where this ""air of reality"" is lacking on the
evidence would be to risk confusing the jury and to invite verdicts not
supported by the evidence.

 

                   While the rule
applies generally, it has attracted special attention in the context of trials
for sexual assault.  This is because one of the most common defences on such
trials, the defence of honest but mistaken belief, is frequently asserted in
cases where there is no evidentiary foundation for it, requiring the court to
advise the jury that there is no air of reality to the defence.

 

                   In order to give an
""air of reality"" to the defence of honest but mistaken belief, there
must be:  (1) evidence of lack of consent to the sexual acts; and (2) evidence
that notwithstanding the actual refusal, the accused honestly but mistakenly
believed that the complainant was consenting.

 

                   The evidence of
lack of consent in most cases is supplied by the complainant's testimony.  To
prove honest but mistaken belief, on the other hand, the accused typically
testifies that he honestly believed that the complainant consented. 
Theoretically, such a belief could be asserted in every case, even where it is
totally at odds with the evidence as to what happened.  So it has been held
that the bare assertion of the accused that he believed in consent is not
enough to raise the defence of honest but mistaken belief; the assertion must
be ""supported to some degree by other evidence or circumstances"":  R.
v. Bulmer, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 782, at p. 790.  The support may come from
the accused or from other sources; on this point I agree with Cory J.'s
resolution of the confusion which existed in the earlier cases.  But the
support must exist.  As Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest put it, a ""facile
mouthing of some easy phrase of excuse"" will not suffice:  Bratty v.
Attorney-General for Northern Ireland, [1963] A.C. 386 (H.L.), at
p. 417.

 

                   It is suggested
that this requirement is at variance with the general rule in criminal law that
wherever there is some evidence supporting a defence, however weak, it must be
left to the jury to determine the sufficiency of that evidence.  Provided there
is any evidence, it is suggested, it is for the jury to decide upon its
sufficiency, not the judge.  To hold otherwise would deprive the accused of his
fundamental right to be tried by a jury.

 

                   It seems to me that
this argument is met by the fact that the accused's mere assertion of his
belief is not evidence of its honesty.  The requirement that the belief be
honestly held is not equivalent to an objective test of what the reasonable
person would have believed.  But nevertheless it does require some support
arising from the circumstances.  A belief which is totally unsupported is not
an honestly held belief.  A person who honestly believes something is a person
who has looked at the circumstances and has drawn an honest inference from
them.  Therefore, for a belief to be honest, there must be some support for it
in the circumstances.  The level of support need not be so great as would
permit the belief to be characterized as a reasonable belief.  But some support
there must be.  A person who commits a sexual assault without some support in
the circumstances for inferring the consent of the complainant has, at very
least, been wilfully blind as to consent.  The law draws a distinction between
""honest belief"" in consent, which arises from an inference, however
mistaken, from the circumstances, and ""wilful blindness"" as to
consent, which is belief not grounded on the circumstances, and which does not
serve as a defence.

 

                   This brings me to
the facts of this case.  The theory of the defence, as noted, was that the
complainant consented, but that she lied about her consent in order to avoid a
confrontation with her parents.  It was in this context that the accused
testified that he believed that the complainant consented.  However, when the
time came to charge the jury, Osolin asked the trial judge to charge the jury
on the additional defence of honest but mistaken belief, which was founded on
the theory that the complainant had not consented.  The trial judge, after noting
that the complainant and the accused told widely different stories, and after
reviewing the law on honest but mistaken belief and the need for support in the
evidence giving the defence an air of reality, concluded:

 

There
must be evidence beyond the mere assertion of belief in consent by the
accused.  That evidence must appear from or be supported by sources other than
the accused in order to give it an air of reality.

 

                   I
find that is lacking here, that there is not that other evidence, and
consequently I am not going to charge the jury, and I am not going to permit
counsel to refer to the defence of mistake of fact.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
agreed.  Southin J.A. held that the trial judge had erred in suggesting that
the evidence needed to give the defence an air of reality must come from
persons other than the accused.  Nevertheless, she concluded that on the
evidence there was no air of reality to the arguments that the accused's belief
in consent deprived him of the necessary mens rea for the offences of
kidnapping or sexual assault (at pp. 183-84 C.R.):

 

The
appellant never said that he honestly believed the taking of her to Parksville
to be not against her will.  He did not say he believed that this complainant
who was naked was agreeing to go on a 40-mile ride on a cold March night with
two comparative strangers both of whom were twice her size.  He did not say
that he had no intention to confine her against her will.  If he had so
testified, who would have believed him?

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   There
is no more imprisoning state short of actual physical restraint than being
without one's clothes.  The best that the appellant said for himself was,
""I wasn't thinking"".  That to me is, at the very least, recklessness
or wilful blindness.

 

                   On the sexual
assault charge, Southin J.A. held that had the abduction not occurred, it might
have been that the issue of honest but mistaken belief should have been left to
the jury.  However, she concluded (at p. 184 C.R.):

 

                   To
my mind, an argument that a man who, knowingly or recklessly, forcibly confined
a woman against her will can have an honest belief that, during her
confinement, she was freely consenting to his sexual advances has no air of
reality about it at all.

 

                   We are left with
one question:  whether there was evidence, from the accused or from some other
source, supporting Osolin's assertion of honest belief.  I agree with the
courts below that there was none.  The undisputed facts reviewed at the outset
of these reasons simply do not admit of an honest belief.  At the very most
they were consistent with wilful blindness.  Any man who drags a woman from her
home naked and protesting, transports her to a remote place, and there ties her
to the bed and has sex with her is at very least put on notice that she may not
be consenting.  His failure to enquire is consistent only with two states of
mind:  an intention to have his way without her consent; or wilful blindness as
to whether she consented or not.  To put it another way, no person, reasonable
or otherwise, could honestly infer consent in such circumstances from
the mere fact that at certain stages, the complainant may have been passively
acquiescent.  The evidence which Osolin put before the jury may have been, as
the trial judge concluded, consistent with wilful blindness.  It offered no
support for the defence of honest but mistaken belief.  As Osolin himself told
the jury, ""I wasn't thinking"".

 

                   Before leaving this
question, I should comment on two points.  The first is the argument that the
divergent stories of the complainant and the accused on consent, as a matter of
law, necessarily preclude a third alternative, the defence of honest but mistaken
belief.  I am not so convinced as my colleagues that where the evidence
consists of two diametrically opposed stories, one alleging lack of consent and
the other consent, it is logically impossible to conceive of the defence of
honest but mistaken belief arising.  While it may rarely occur, it seems to me
possible for a jury to accept parts of the testimonies of both the complainant
and the accused, concluding that notwithstanding lack of actual consent, the
accused honestly believed in consent.  As A. W. Bryant states:

 

...the
removal of this alternative plea on the basis that the testimony of the
complainant and the accused are diametrically opposed, and that there is a lack
of common ground for the defence is based, in part, on the premise that the complainant's
version is complete -- a questionable assumption in some cases.  Moreover, a
requirement for corroboration may wrongly encourage an accused to dovetail
partially his testimony with that of the complainant in order to supply the
necessary common ground for the defence.

 

(""The Issue of Consent in the
Crime of Sexual Assault"" (1989), 68 Can. Bar Rev. 94, at p. 149.)

 

                   The second matter
is the comment of my colleague Cory J. that the Court of Appeal erred in
concluding that the kidnapping could not be used as a ground for rejecting the
defence of mistake of fact.  He reasons that this was incorrect since there had
been no prior conviction for kidnapping.  In other words, he sees the reasoning
of the Court of Appeal as circular, in that it makes the inference that there
is no defence with respect to the offence of sexual assault because there was
none on kidnapping, which itself was in issue.  I must say that I do not read
the reasons of the Court of Appeal in this manner.  It seems to me that Southin
J.A. was saying only that the evidence of confinement robbed the defence
of honest but mistaken belief of any foundation.

 

                   I agree for the
reasons given by Cory J. that the section of the Criminal Code  which
requires the accused who raises the defence of honest but mistaken belief in
consent to show that the defence has an air of reality, s. 265(4) , does not
violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

Disposition

 

                   I would dismiss the
appeal.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   Sopinka
J. -- I have read the
reasons of Justice Cory and agree with the result he has reached and with his
reasons, subject to the following observation.

 

                   While I agree with
his reasons relating to cross-examination on the medical records, I would
prefer not to comment on s. 276  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.
C-46  (as amended by An Act to amend the Criminal Code (sexual assault),
S.C. 1992, c. 38, s. 2).  My colleague's reference to it might be construed as
a comment on its constitutionality which is not an issue that is before us.  

 

                   With respect to the
defence of mistaken belief, I agree with Cory J. that s. 265(4)  ""simply
sets out the basic requirements which are applicable to all defences"" (p.
676) and that it requires no more of the accused than the discharge of an
evidentiary burden to adduce or point to some evidence on the basis of which a
reasonable jury properly instructed could acquit.  I believe we are all in
agreement in this respect.  Indeed, this is the basis for our determination
that it is constitutional.  The term ""evidentiary burden"" and the
definition I have set out are well known to trial judges and well accepted.  I
cannot understand how the addition of the term ""air of reality"" helps
in understanding the duty of a trial judge with respect to this defence.  I am
concerned that when an attempt is made to add to the definition of a basic
concept in the criminal law, it only creates confusion.  Just as attempts to
refine the meaning of ""reasonable doubt"" have frequently resulted in
reversible error, so too the use of the ""air of reality"" test
encourages trial judges to weigh the evidence rather than apply the legal
definition to which I have referred.

 

                   I agree with the
reservations expressed by McLachlin J. with respect to Cory J.'s approval of
the principle that the defence of mistaken belief is not available if the
complainant and the accused relate diametrically opposed versions of what
occurred.

 

                   Excluding the
defence of mistaken belief where the accused and complainant tell opposing
versions rests on the assumption that either the accused's or the complainant's
story is a complete account of what occurred.  As J. M. Williams (""Mistake
of Fact:  The Legacy of Pappajohn v. The Queen"" (1985), 63 Can.
Bar Rev. 597) points out, this is a questionable assumption.  Referring to Pappajohn
([1980] 2 S.C.R. 120), Williams, at pp. 611-12, states:

 

It
is implicit in the majority decision that the jury would either totally accept
one story or totally reject it.  If this was a correct reading of what the jury
would do then one can readily understand why the majority could not see any
purpose in putting the alternative defence of mistake to the jury.  Assuming,
as was suggested, that the two stories were totally incompatible then, if the jury
believed the accused's story in toto, he would be acquitted on the basis
that there was no actus reus (i.e., consent was present).  If the jury
totally believed the complainant, then not only would the actus reus
have been proven but moreover the jury would have already branded the accused
as a liar.  Therefore, it becomes unrealistic to suggest that they would
nonetheless hold that he had an honest belief in consent.  

 

                   The
above reasoning appears logical, given the premise.  The question remains, however,
whether it is correct to assume that a jury will accept one story in its
totality and reject the other completely?  It would seem not.  Where there are
conflicting versions of facts, the trier of fact must ""find"" what
happened.  It is well accepted that in doing so, the trier of fact is not bound
to deal with one party's evidence as a whole but may accept some of it and
reject that which is unacceptable.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

                   In Lee
Chun-Chuen v. The Queen, [1963] 1 All E.R. 73 (P.C.), Lord Devlin, in
discussing the manner in which an evidentiary burden in respect of provocation
may be discharged, stated, at p. 80:

 

What
is essential is that there should be produced, either from as much of the
accused's evidence as is acceptable or from the evidence of other witnesses or
from a reasonable combination of both, a credible narrative of events
disclosing material that suggests provocation in law.  If no such narrative is
obtainable from the evidence, the jury cannot be invited to construct one.

 

                   As a matter of
standard practice, a jury in criminal cases is instructed that in assessing the
evidence of a witness, it is not an all-or-nothing proposition.  A typical jury
instruction is as follows:

 

                   When
you consider the evidence of a witness, please understand that you do not have
to accept or reject everything a particular witness said.  You may, of course,
decide to accept or reject everything a witness said in the witness box.  But
you may also decide to accept only some of what a witness said, and reject the
rest.

 

(G. A. Ferguson and J. C. Bouck, Canadian
Criminal Jury Instructions (2nd ed. 1989), vol. 1, at p. 4.12-2.)

 

                   I would dispose of
the appeal as proposed by Cory J.

 

                   The judgment of
Cory and Major JJ. was delivered by

 

                   Cory
J. -- There are two basic
issues raised on this appeal.  One is whether the ""air of reality""
test which is set out in s. 265(4)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-46 , violated the appellant's constitutional rights under ss. 11 (d)
and 11 (f) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  The
other is whether the Court of Appeal erred in failing to grant a new trial on
the basis of the restrictions imposed by the trial judge on the
cross-examination of the complainant.

 

I.  Factual Background

 

                     The complainant
in this case is a 17-year-old girl.  She had been in a psychiatric hospital in
January and February of 1987, but by March 26, of that same year she was living
with her parents near Ladysmith in British Columbia.  Although she was 17 years
of age, she had a limited education.  She had completed grade 8 and left school
at 14 years of age.  She is not physically a big girl,  5 feet 7 inches in
height and weighing only 115 pounds.

 

                   On the morning of
March 26, a friend by the name of Brad Dick, whom she had dated on a few
occasions, called her and they arranged to meet at eleven o'clock that
morning.  Dick, who was in his mid twenties arrived at the meeting place with a
friend of his by the name of Ken Smith, who was in his thirties.  

 

                   The three went to
Jim Bragg's trailer, north of Ladysmith.  There they drank some beer.  From
there, they went to Dual Mountain and then went to Boat Harbour.  There Brad
Dick and the complainant went to a secluded area and had consensual sexual
relations.  

 

                   The three friends
eventually returned to the trailer.  There Smith gave Dick a ride into town
around 5:00 p.m.  Smith returned and he, the complainant and Bragg spent time
together drinking and playing cards.  The complainant stayed with Bragg and
Smith because in her words they seemed like ""pretty nice guys"" and
she enjoyed their company.  The three went for a drive in Smith's car but it
was experiencing mechanical difficulties.  It stalled some 100 feet from the
trailer and they had to push it.  While they were doing so, the appellant,
Stephen Osolin, and Russell McCallum came by in another car.  All five spent a
few minutes in the trailer.  Smith and the complainant went out to his car
where they were kissing and petting.  Bragg, McCallum and Osolin left the
trailer to go to a pub.  When they did so, Bragg told Smith and the complainant
that they could use the trailer.  Smith and the complainant then went into the
bedroom of the trailer where they engaged in sexual intercourse.  

 

                   Meanwhile at the
pub, Bragg told McCallum and Osolin that the complainant was promiscuous, or in
his words ""easy"", and they all could have a turn with her.  McCallum
and Osolin left Bragg at the Pub and drove back to his trailer.  There they
barged into the bedroom, rousted Smith out of bed, took him outside and drove
him some distance away from the trailer.  In passing it should be noted that
Smith, who was 5 feet 7 inches and weighing 150 pounds, was considerably
smaller than the other men.

 

                   Back in the
bedroom, McCallum grabbed the complainant and threw her onto the bed.  She was
shocked and scared.  McCallum touched and fondled her and would not let her get
dressed.  He attempted to have sexual intercourse with her but she struggled. 
He became angry and his threatening words made her fearful.  She heard the car
returning and tried to put on her blouse, but once again McCallum prevented
her.  In doing so, he tore her Viking pendant from her neck.  She saw it fall
onto the bed and clutched it.  Later she let the pendant fall in the cabin in
Parksville, where it was located by the police.  She managed to get her
underpants on as Osolin entered the room.  

 

                   She stated that
someone hit her on the side of the head.  Osolin threw her over his shoulder
and carried her out to the car.  When she was being carried out she said that
she wanted her clothes.  The complainant said that she resisted leaving the
trailer, said that she wanted her clothes but that her head was hit on the door
jam and Osolin struck her on the face.  Neither Osolin nor McCallum got her
clothes for her.  The appellant admitted that he ""overrode"" her
complaints about being forced while naked to leave the trailer.  The
complainant testified that Osolin then put the complainant in the back seat of
the car and tore off her underpants.  Osolin and McCallum both testified that
the complainant was nude at this time and Osolin had not ripped off her
underpants.  The police later found a pair of torn women's underwear pants
lying on the ground some 20 feet from the front of the trailer.  

 

                   Osolin got into the
back seat with the complainant and McCallum then drove away.  She was on her
left side and Osolin would not let her sit up.  She said that she was crying at
the time and unable to move.  Osolin fondled her breasts and tried to pry her
legs apart with his hands.  She did not consent to any of the touching and said
she was struggling when he forcefully hit her on the side of the face.  She
specifically denied kissing, petting and drinking beer or having a friendly
conversation with him.  Osolin testified that the complainant did nothing which
indicated she was not consenting.

 

                   Eventually the car
stopped and Osolin pulled her out.  He held her by the right biceps and pulled
her through a fence.  McCallum drove away.  At this time she was wearing only a
pair of white socks.  She was very cold, upset and crying.  In the cabin he
pulled her into a bedroom.  The complainant testified that he threw her on the
bed and tied her hands behind her back with a cord, which he pulled from a
lamp.  When Osolin left the bedroom for a moment, she ran to a window and tried
to escape but he returned with more electrical cords which he had torn from an
appliance.  He tied her spread eagle to the bed frame.  She testified that she
was screaming and he said ""I could kill you so easily"" and would do
so unless she was ""good"".  He returned to the bedroom with soap and a
razor and started shaving her pubic hair.  She told him to stop but he
persisted.  She managed to hit him with one knee and he tied that leg tighter. 
He then raped her.  The appellant testified that the complainant was an eager
although not active participant in all the acts leading up to and including
sexual intercourse.  

 

                   After the act of
intercourse he untied her and she asked if she could take a bath.  Although she
locked the bathroom door, the appellant pried it open and came in.  She
testified that while in the bathroom the appellant apologized for all that had
happened.  The appellant said he apologized only for using the razor, because there
was nothing else to apologize for.  He gave her an old nightgown and a  sweater
to wear.  When she got out of the bath, the two laid down on the bed and either
passed out or fell asleep.  The complainant testified that when she awoke the
appellant was touching her again.  The complainant became hysterical and said
she wanted to go home.  The appellant testified that he was awoken by the
complainant saying she had to go to Ladysmith.  The appellant said McCallum
would pick them up in the morning, but when she insisted on leaving he put her
out of the cabin and pointed her to the highway.

 

                   Shortly before 3:30
a.m. an RCMP constable found the complainant on the highway, screaming and
crying hysterically.  He asked her if she had been raped and she replied that
she had.   He drove her back to the police detachment where she asked to use
the washroom and vomited.  She continued to cry hysterically and was taken to
the emergency room at the hospital in Nanaimo.

 

                   The medical
examination revealed the complainant had a number of bruises, abrasions and
scratches, including bruising, swelling and discoloration in the genital area. 
Generally, the injuries noted were more consistent with sexual assault than
consensual intercourse.

 

                   The jury found the
appellant guilty of both sexual assault and kidnapping.  He was sentenced to
six years on the count for sexual assault and four years for kidnapping, the
sentences to be served concurrently.

 

II.  Courts Below

 

Trial Court

 

                   The trial judge
directed the jury that with respect to the charge of kidnapping the Crown had
to demonstrate that the appellant had intended to  confine the complainant
against her will.  With regard to sexual assault, he told the jury that lack of
consent on the part of the complainant had to be proven beyond a reasonable
doubt.  He did not specifically tell the jury that the accused had to
appreciate that the complainant was not consenting in order to commit the
offence, and he declined to charge the jury with respect to the defence of
honest but mistaken belief in consent.  He ruled that there was no ""air of
reality"" to the defence of mistake of fact as was required by the
decisions in Pappajohn v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120, and Sansregret
v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 570.  He stated ""[t]here must be
evidence beyond the mere assertion of belief in consent by the accused.  That
evidence must appear from or be supported by sources other than the accused in
order to give it an air of reality"".  

 

                   During the course
of the trial the complainant's mental health records were admitted.  They had
been obtained in order to permit an expert to consider them on the issue of the
complainant's competence to testify under oath.  Counsel sought leave to
cross-examine the complainant on those records, specifically on the following
note in the records which is dated July 9, 1987:

 

The
hearing into the sexual assault has been postponed until September.  Linda now
wishes that it had not been postponed.  She is concerned that her attitude and
behaviour may have influenced the man to some extent and is having second
thoughts about the entire case.

 

                   The trial judge
refused to permit counsel to cross examine on this note ruling that the records
had been made available for the limited purpose of determining competence of
the complainant to testify under oath.  Further exploration by means of
cross-examination would in his opinion be a violation of the complainant's
right to privacy.  

 

The Court of Appeal (1991), 7 B.C.A.C. 181, 15 W.A.C.
181, 10 C.R. (4th) 159

 

                   Southin J.A.
writing for the court considered first whether the trial judge had erred in
failing to charge the jury with respect to the mens rea required for the
offences of sexual assault and kidnapping.  On the basis of R. v. Robertson,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 918, and R. v. Bulmer, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 782, she held
with regard to sexual assault that the trial judge had erred in his appreciation
of the air of reality requirement.  She expressed the opinion that the
testimony of the accused alone might give an air of reality to the defence of
mistaken belief that the complainant was consenting.

 

                   However, she found
that while the trial judge had erred on this issue, the error did not result in
any misdirection to the jury, as there was nothing in the appellant's evidence
which required the trial judge to charge the jury on the mens rea
required to commit the offence of kidnapping.  The appellant had never
testified that he believed that the complainant was consenting to being taken
to Parksville without any clothes, nor that it was not his intention to confine
her against her will.  In any event, she expressed the opinion that he would
not have been believed, if he had testified in such a manner.  In the absence
of the commission of the offence of kidnapping by the appellant, she noted that
it might have been preferable that the issue of mens rea had been left
with the jury on the question of sexual assault.  However she wrote (at p. 184
C.R.):

 

...an
argument that a man who, knowingly or recklessly, forcibly confined a woman
against her will can have an honest belief that, during her confinement, she
was freely consenting to his sexual advances has no air of reality about it at
all.

 

                   Thus it was held
that the omission from the charge of any direction as to mens rea for
sexual assault did not amount to a misdirection.  

 

                   Southin J.A. then
dealt with the appellant's alternative submission that the trial judge's
decision not to refer to the defence of honest but mistaken belief in his
charge to the jury constituted a violation of the appellant's rights to be
presumed innocent until proven guilty and to a trial by jury as guaranteed by
ss. 11 (d) and 11 (f) of the Charter .  She rejected this
contention holding that the Charter  does not require the judge in his
charge to draw to the attention of the jury all legally possible issues
regardless of whether they arise on the evidence.

 

                    Lastly on the
cross-examination question, it was held that the trial judge erred in basing
his refusal to allow cross-examination on the complainant's mental health
records on the grounds that it would violate her right to privacy.  It was held
that if the cross-examination on the records went to the credibility of the
complainant then counsel for the appellant should have been permitted to
cross-examine.  However, since the trial record did not disclose what questions
counsel proposed to ask, it was determined that this ground of appeal must also
fail.  

 

III.  Analysis

 

A.  The Trial Judge's Restriction
of Cross-examination

 

                   (1) Cross-examination
as a Fundamental Aspect of a Fair Trial

 

                   There can be no
question of the importance of cross-examination.  It is of essential importance
in determining whether a witness is credible.  Even with the most honest
witness cross-examination can provide the means to explore the frailties of the
testimony.  For example, it can demonstrate a witness's weakness of sight or
hearing.  It can establish that the existing weather conditions may have
limited the ability of a witness to observe, or that medication taken by the
witness would have distorted vision or hearing.  Its importance cannot be
denied.  It is the ultimate means of demonstrating truth and of testing
veracity.  Cross-examination must be permitted so that an accused can make full
answer and defence.  The opportunity to cross-examine witnesses is fundamental
to providing a fair trial to an accused.  This is an old and well established
principle that is closely linked to the presumption of innocence.  See R. v.
Anderson (1938), 70 C.C.C. 275 (Man. C.A.); R. v. Rewniak (1949), 93
C.C.C. 142 (Man. C.A.); Abel v. The Queen (1955), 115 C.C.C. 119 (Que.
Q.B.); R. v. Lindlau (1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 47 (Ont. C.A.).  The
importance of the right to cross-examine was well expressed by the Court in the
reasons of Ritchie J. in Titus v. The Queen, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 259, at pp.
263-64.  There he wrote:

 

                   I
think it essential to stress the purpose for which the cross- examination is
permitted, namely, in order that the defence may explore to the full all
factors which might expose the frailty of the evidence called by the
prosecution.  That the accused as he stands in the prisoner's box on trial for
murder is deemed to be innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
is one of the fundamental presumptions inherent in the common law and as such
the accused is entitled to employ every legitimate means of testing the
evidence called by the Crown to negative that presumption and in my opinion
this includes the right to explore all circumstances capable of indicating that
any of the prosecution witnesses had a motive for favouring the Crown.

 

                   In R. v.
Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, it was once again emphasized that the right
to cross-examine constitutes a principle of fundamental justice that is
critical to the fairness of the accused's trial.  In that case, the right to
cross-examine was placed in the context of the right to make full answer and
defence (at p. 608, per McLachlin J.):

 

                   The
right of the innocent not to be convicted is dependent on the right to present
full answer and defence.  This, in turn, depends on being able to call the
evidence necessary to establish a defence and to challenge the evidence called
by the prosecution.    

 

                                                                    ...

 

In
short, the denial of the right to call and challenge evidence is tantamount to
the denial of the right to rely on a defence to which the law says one is
entitled.  The defence which the law gives with one hand, may be taken away
with the other.  Procedural limitations make possible the conviction of persons
who the criminal law says are innocent.

 

                   Cross-examination
is all the more crucial to the accused's ability to make full answer and
defence when credibility is the central issue in the trial.  Such was the
finding made by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Anandmalik (1984),
6 O.A.C. 143, at p. 144:

 

In a
case where the guilt or innocence of the [accused] largely turned on
credibility, it was a serious error to limit the [accused] of his substantial
right to fully cross-examine the principal Crown witness.  It would not be
appropriate in the circumstances to invoke or apply the curative provisions of
s. 613(1)(b)(iii).

 

The same point was made by the Alberta
Court of Appeal in R. v. Giffin (1986), 69 A.R. 158, at p. 159:

 

                   We
agree ...that the events about which counsel sought to cross-examine were
relevant on the question of the credibility of the witness .... The accused in
this case cannot be said to have had an opportunity for a fair answer and
defence when he was not permitted to ask them.

 

To the same effect is R. v. Wallick
(1990), 69 Man. R. (2d) 310 (C.A.), where at p. 311 it was said:

 

                   Cross-examination
is a most powerful weapon of the defence, particularly when the entire case turns
on credibility of the witnesses.  An accused in a criminal case has the right
of cross-examination in the fullest and widest sense of the word as long as he
does not abuse that right.  Any improper interference with the right is an
error which will result in the conviction being quashed.

 

                   Thus it can be seen
that the right to cross-examine has always been held to be of fundamental
importance in a criminal trial.  That right is now protected by ss. 7  and
11 (d) of the Charter .  As a result it should be interpreted in
the ""broad and generous manner befitting its constitutional status""
(see R. v. Potvin, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 525, at p. 544).

 

                   (2) Limitations
on the Right to Cross-examine

 

                   Despite its
importance the right to cross-examine has never been unlimited.  It must
conform to the basic principle that all evidence must be relevant in order to
be admissible.  In addition the probative value of evidence must be weighed
against its prejudicial effect.  See Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 1A
(Tillers rev. 1983), at pp. 969 and 975.  Lamer J. (as he then was)
commented on the need for cross-examination to comply with these two principles
in Morris v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 190, at p. 201:

 

                   Thayer's
statement of the law which is still the law in Canada, was as follows:

 

(1)
that nothing is to be received which is not logically probative of some matter
requiring to be proved; and (2) that everything which is thus probative should
come in, unless a clear ground of policy or law excludes it.

 

To
this general statement should be added the discretionary power judges exercise
to exclude logically relevant evidence

 

...
as being of too slight a significance, or as having too conjectural and
remote a connection; others, as being dangerous, in their effect on the jury,
and likely to be misused or overestimated by that body; others, as being
impolitic, or unsafe on public grounds; others, on the bare ground of
precedent.  It is this sort of thing ... -- the rejection on one or another
practical ground, of what is really probative, -- which is the characteristic
thing in the law of evidence; stamping it as the child of the jury system. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   Relevance and
probative value must be determined in the context of the purpose for which
evidence is tendered.  Evidence relevant and probative to one issue may not be
relevant and probative to another.  In the context of sexual assaults, this
limitation on cross-examination has been recognized to prevent its use for
improper purposes.  For example, it cannot be used to elicit the prior sexual
history of a complainant for the purpose of impugning her credibility.  It has
been recognized that the myth that for some reason the complainant's
credibility would be affected by prior sexual experience is completely
groundless.  In Seaboyer, supra, s. 277  of the Criminal Code 's
prohibition of cross-examination on prior sexual history for the purpose of
impugning credibility of the complainant was upheld in the following terms (at
pp. 612-13, per McLachlin J.):

 

                   Section
277  excludes evidence of sexual reputation for the purpose of challenging or
supporting the credibility of the plaintiff.  The idea that a complainant's
credibility might be affected by whether she has had other sexual experience is
today universally discredited.  There is no logical or practical link between a
woman's sexual reputation and whether she is a truthful witness.  It follows
that the evidence excluded by s. 277  can serve no legitimate purpose in
the trial.  Section 277 , by limiting the exclusion to a purpose which is
clearly illegitimate, does not touch evidence which may be tendered for valid
purposes, and hence does not infringe the right to a fair trial.

 

                   In contrast,
s. 276  of the Criminal Code  was struck down since it provided a
blanket prohibition on cross-examination on previous sexual history of the
complainant in a sexual assault case regardless of the purpose for which that
evidence was being adduced.  The Court held that such evidence could not be
said to be of such trifling weight that its prejudicial effect would always
outweigh its probative value (Seaboyer, supra, at p. 613).

 

                   The issue of
admissibility of evidence in a sexual assault case requires a careful
balancing.  On one hand there must be care and sensitivity exhibited to ensure
that the complainant's cross-examination is relevant and pertinent and not
needlessly extended for improper purposes.  On the other hand the accused's
right to a fair trial must always be protected.  This principle was accepted in
Seaboyer, supra, and is reflected in Parliament's enactment of new
provisions to replace the former s. 276  (An Act to amend the Criminal
Code (sexual assault), S.C. 1992, c. 38, s. 2, which came into force
on August 15, 1992).  These provisions aim directly at preventing the use of
cross examination and introduction of evidence for improper purposes.  The new
section provides:

 

                   276.     (1) In proceedings in respect of
an offence under section 151, 152, 153, 155 or 159, subsection 160(2) or (3) or
section 170, 171, 172, 173, 271, 272 or 273, evidence that the complainant has
engaged in sexual activity, whether with the accused or with any other person,
is not admissible to support an inference that, by reason of the sexual nature
of that activity, the complainant

 

(a)
is more likely to have consented to the sexual activity that forms the
subject-matter of the charge; or

 

(b)
is less worthy of belief.

 

                   (2)
In proceedings in respect of an offence referred to in subsection (1), no
evidence shall be adduced by or on behalf of the accused that the complainant
has engaged in sexual activity other than the sexual activity that forms the
subject-matter of the charge, whether with the accused or with any other
person, unless the judge, provincial court judge or justice determines, in
accordance with the procedures set out in sections 276.1 and 276.2, that the
evidence

 

(a)
is of specific instances of sexual activity;

 

(b)
is relevant to an issue at trial; and

 

(c)
has significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the
danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice.

 

                   (3)
In determining whether evidence is admissible under subsection (2), the judge,
provincial court judge or justice shall take into account

 

(a)
the interests of justice, including the right of the accused to make a full
answer and defence;

 

(b)
society's interest in encouraging the reporting of sexual assault offences;

 

(c)
whether there is a reasonable prospect that the evidence will assist in
arriving at a just determination in the case;

 

(d)
the need to remove from the fact-finding process any discriminatory belief
or bias;

 

(e)
the risk that the evidence may unduly arouse sentiments of prejudice,
sympathy or hostility in the jury;

 

(f)
the potential prejudice to the complainant's personal dignity and right
of privacy;

 

(g)
the right of the complainant and of every individual to personal security and
to the full protection and benefit of the law; and

 

(h)
any other factor that the judge, provincial court judge or justice considers
relevant.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Sections 276.1 to 276.3 deal with
application for a hearing, exclusion of the jury and public and publication
bans.  Finally s. 276.4 provides:

 

                   276.4  Where evidence is admitted at trial
pursuant to a determination made under section 276.2, the judge shall instruct
the jury as to the uses that the jury may and may not make of that evidence.

 

                   These statutory
provisions mirror the concern for the appropriate protection of the interest of
the complainants in sexual assault cases that were set forth in Seaboyer. 
Both the reasons of McLachlin J. and the new provisions of the Code
suggest the factors which should be considered in limiting the scope of cross-examination
of a complainant in a sexual assault trial.  It cannot be forgotten that a
sexual assault is very different from other assaults.  It is true that it, like
all the other forms of assault, is an act of violence.  Yet it is something
more than a simple act of violence.  Sexual assault is in the vast majority of
cases gender based.  It is an assault upon human dignity and constitutes a
denial of any concept of equality for women.

 

                   The reality of the
situation can be seen from the statistics which demonstrate that 99 percent of
the offenders in sexual assault cases are men and 90 percent of the victims are
women.  See Gender Equality in the Canadian Justice System:  Summary
Document and Proposals for Action (April 1992), at p. 13.  We have
seen that the accused's rights to a fair trial and to cross-examine are
protected by the common law and given constitutional sanctity by ss. 7  and
11 (d).  However in the context of sexual assault the rights of the
complainant cannot be completely overlooked.  The provisions of ss. 15  and
28  of the Charter  guaranteeing equality to men and women, although not
determinative should be taken into account in determining the reasonable
limitations that should be placed upon the cross-examination of a complainant. 
It is only right that reasonable limitations be placed upon such
cross-examination.  A complainant should not be unduly harassed and pilloried
to the extent of becoming a victim of an insensitive judicial system.  Yet a
fair balance must be achieved so that the limitations on the cross-examination
of complainants in sexual assault cases do not interfere with the right of the
accused to a fair trial.

 

                   In Seaboyer
it was stressed that the trial judge must be responsible for ensuring that only
probative evidence is admitted and that the purpose for which that evidence is
admitted is legitimate.  At page 634 the following appears:

 

First,
the judge must assess with a high degree of sensitivity whether the evidence
proffered by the defence meets the test of demonstrating a degree of relevance
which outweighs the damages and disadvantages presented by the admission of
such evidence....The trial judge must ensure that evidence is tendered for a
legitimate purpose, and that it logically supports a defence.  The fishing expeditions
which unfortunately did occur in the past should not be permitted.  The trial
judge's discretion must be exercised to ensure that neither the in camera
procedure nor the trial become forums for demeaning and abusive conduct by
defence counsel.

 

. .
. It is hoped that a sensitive and responsive exercise of discretion by the
judiciary will reduce and even eliminate the concerns which provoked
legislation such as s. 276 , while at the same time preserving the right of
an accused to a fair trial.

 

                   The reasons in Seaboyer
make it clear that eliciting evidence from a complainant for the purpose of
encouraging inferences pertaining to consent or the credibility of rape victims
which are based on groundless myths and fantasized stereotypes is improper.  A
number of rape myths have in the past improperly formed the background for
considering evidentiary issues in sexual assault trials.  These include the
false concepts that:   women cannot be raped against their will; only ""bad
girls"" are raped; anyone not clearly of ""good character"" is more
likely to have consented.  (See C. A. MacKinnon, Toward a Feminist Theory of
the State (1989), at p. 175; L. L. Holmstrom and A. W. Burgess, The
Victim of Rape:  Institutional Reactions (1983); and Gender Equality in
the Canadian Justice System, supra, at p. 18.)  In Seaboyer, supra,
McLachlin J. observed that these myths were now discredited at p. 604:

 

Evidence
that the complainant had relations with the accused and others was routinely
presented (and accepted by judges and juries) as tending to make it more likely
that the complainant had consented to the alleged assault and as undermining
her credibility generally.  These inferences were based not on facts, but on
the myths that unchaste women were more likely to consent to intercourse and in
any event, were less worthy of belief.  These twin myths are now discredited.

 

                   It might be helpful
to summarize the principles that can be taken from Seaboyer with regard
to the cross-examination of complainants.  Generally, a complainant may be
cross-examined for the purpose of eliciting evidence relating to consent and
pertaining to credibility when the probative value of that evidence is not
substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice which might flow
from it.  Cross-examination for the purposes of showing consent or impugning
credibility which relies upon ""rape myths"" will always be more
prejudicial than probative.  Such evidence can fulfil no legitimate purpose and
would therefore be inadmissible to go to consent or credibility. 
Cross-examination which has as its aim to elicit such evidence should not be
permitted.  It will be up to the trial judge to take into consideration all of
the evidence presented at the voir dire and to then determine if there
is a legitimate purpose for the proposed cross-examination.

 

                   In each case the
trial judge must carefully balance the fundamentally important right of the
accused to a fair trial against the need for reasonable protection of a
complainant, particularly where the purpose of the cross-examination may be
directed to ""rape myths"".  In order to assure the fairness of the
trial, where contentious issues arise as to the cross-examination of the
complainant a voir dire should be held.  In the voir dire it will
be necessary to show either by way of submissions of counsel, affidavit or viva
voce evidence that the proposed cross-examination is appropriate.  If at
the conclusion of the voir dire the cross-examination is permitted then
the jury must be advised as to the proper use that can be made of the evidence
derived from the cross-examination. As a general rule the trial of an accused
on a charge of sexual assault need not and should not become an occasion for
putting the complainant's lifestyle and reputation on trial.  The exception to
this rule will arise in those relatively rare cases where the complainant may
be fraudulent, cruelly mischievous or maliciously mendacious.  

 

                   (3) Application
to the Facts of this Case

 

                   Some 100 pages of
medical records were placed before the court in order to determine the
complainant's reliability to testify under oath.  Counsel for the appellant
sought to cross-examine the complainant on them, particularly on the notation
made on July 9, 1987, referred to above in the summary of the reasons of the
trial court.

 

                   Before this Court
it was argued that cross-examination on this entry might have elicited evidence
which would be relevant to the appellant's belief in the complainant's
consent.  

 

                   It will be
remembered that the trial judge refused cross-examination on the ground that it
would be a violation of the complainant's privacy to use the medical records
for any purpose other than determining her ability to testify under oath.  The
Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had erred, but concluded that there
was nothing in the medical records which would allow it to deduce what
questions counsel at trial proposed to ask had he been permitted to make use of
those records.  Therefore the Court of Appeal found that it could not properly
deal with the ruling on the cross-examination.  

 

                   There has been no
submission made that the medical records were improperly before the court.  It
was accepted by all parties that they were necessary to determine the issue as
to the complainant's ability to testify under oath.  Once the medical records
were properly admitted, then it was open to the defence to cross-examine upon
them in appropriate circumstances.  This should not be taken to mean that
medical or psychiatric records of complainants in sexual cases will
automatically be admissible.  There must be a sound basis in relevance for
their admission.  In most cases there should be a reasonably close temporal
connection between the medical reports and the assault.

 

                   It is true that the
privacy of the complainant is an interest that merits protection as does the
need for a relationship of confidence between a patient and her psychiatrist. 
However, that right to privacy must be balanced against the need to provide a fair
trial for the accused and to avoid a miscarriage of justice.  Once the medical
reports were properly admitted, then in order to ensure a fair trial,
cross-examination upon them within the guidelines set out earlier, should have
been permitted.  

 

                   The purpose of the
cross-examination must be a significant factor in determining if it is
appropriate.  Here the defence counsel in submissions to the trial judge
indicated that the cross-examination would be directed towards ""what kind
of person the complainant is"".  This on its face appears to be the very
sort of improper purpose for which evidence cannot be adduced and a jury would
have to have been cautioned to that effect.  Without anything further as to the
object it would seem that the trial judge was correct in refusing to permit
cross-examination for that purpose.

 

                   However, quite
apart from the submissions of the defence counsel, it is the duty of the trial
judge to ensure that the accused's rights with regard to cross-examination,
which are so essential to the defence, are protected.  The trial judge had
before him all the medical records.  It would have been appropriate to permit
cross-examination with regard to the July 9 record, particularly to determine
if it would throw any light either upon a possible motive of the complainant to
allege that she was the victim of sexual assault or with regard to her conduct
which might have led the appellant to believe that she was consenting to sexual
advances.  

 

                   There was then a
sound basis for permitting cross-examination upon the medical reports,
particularly the notation of July 9.  In the absence of that cross-examination,
it is impossible to know what evidence might have been adduced.  When the
opportunity to cross-examine was denied, the accused was deprived of his right
to a fair trial.  As Wilson J. stated in Potvin, supra, at p. 543:

 

...
it is the opportunity to cross-examine and not the fact of cross-examination
which is crucial if the accused is to be treated fairly.

 

                   I would repeat for
purposes of emphasis that the cross-examination of a complainant can only be
undertaken for proper purposes and its ambit may well be restricted.  Although
cross-examination on the medical records ought to have been permitted in this
case, that does not mean that it will necessarily bring forth evidence helpful
to the position of the appellant.  For example what the complainant said to her
counsellor on July 9, could well reflect a victim's unfortunate and unwarranted
feelings of guilt and shame for actions and events that were in no way her
fault.  Feelings of guilt, shame and lowered self-esteem are often the result
of the trauma of a sexual assault.  If this is indeed the basis for her
statement to the counsellor, then they could not in any way lend an air of
reality to the accused's proposed defence of mistaken belief in the
complainant's consent.  However, in the absence of cross-examination it is
impossible to know what the result might have been.  

 

                   In summary then,
the opportunity to cross-examine on the medical record was essential to ensure
that the accused had the benefit of a fair trial.  The denial of that
opportunity, and the impossibility of ascertaining what might have been the
result of the cross-examination, make it necessary to order a new trial on those
grounds.  

 

                   However, the
appellant also challenges the validity of s. 265(4)  of the Criminal
Code  and that issue must be resolved.

 

B.  Section 265(4) of the Criminal
Code:  the Mistake of Fact and Defence

 

                   Section 265(4)
provides as follows:

 

                          265.  ...

                   (4)
Where an accused alleges that he believed that the complainant consented to the
conduct that is the subject-matter of the charge, a judge, if satisfied that
there is sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence
would constitute a defence, shall instruct the jury, when reviewing all the
evidence relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused's belief,
to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief.  

 

                   The appellant's
first submission is that the courts below erred in their finding that the
evidence was insufficient to justify putting the defence of mistaken belief in
the complainant's consent to the jury.  In the absence of any evidence which
might be held to be admissible arising from a cross-examination on the medical
records at a new trial, and considering only the evidence presented at the
trial it would be difficult to find any error in that decision.  Here the
evidence of the complainant was emphatically to the effect there was no consent
and that nothing she said or did would give rise to a belief that she was
consenting to the actions of the appellant.  On the other hand the appellant
testified that the complainant was throughout an enthusiastic and willing if
not a particularly active participant in all his actions.  On that basis there
would appear to be no basis for considering the defence of a mistaken belief in
the consent of the complainant.  However, as there must be a new trial to allow
for a cross-examination upon the medical records within the guidelines
outlined, it would be inappropriate to discuss this issue in light of the fresh
evidence that may be forthcoming.  

 

                   The second position
put forward by the appellant is that s. 265(4) violates the rights of an
accused under ss. 11 (d) (the presumption of innocence) and 11(f)
(the right to trial by jury).  

 

(1) 
Interpretation of Section 265(4)

 

                   Section 265(4)  of
the Criminal Code  is applicable to all assaults, not just sexual
assaults.  It appears to be no more than the codification of the common law
defence of mistake of fact.  See Robertson, supra, and R. v. Jobidon,
[1991] 2 S.C.R. 714, at p. 730.  In my view the section simply sets out the
basic requirements which are applicable to all defences.  Namely, that a
defence should not be put to the jury if a reasonable jury properly instructed
would have been unable to acquit on the basis of the evidence tendered in
support of that defence.  On the other hand, if a reasonable jury properly instructed
could acquit on the basis of the evidence tendered with regard to that defence,
then it must be put to the jury.  It is for the trial judge to decide whether
the evidence is sufficient to warrant putting a defence to a jury as this is a
question of law alone. (See Parnerkar v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 449,
and Pappajohn, supra.)  There is thus a two step procedure which
must be followed.  First, the trial judge must review all the evidence and
decide if it is sufficient to warrant putting the defence to the jury.  Second,
if the evidence meets that threshold, the trial judge must put the defence to
the jury, which in turn will weigh it and decide whether it raises a reasonable
doubt.  See Wigmore on Evidence, supra, at pp. 968-69; and R. v.
Faid, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 276.  I take this to be the meaning
of the words ""sufficient evidence"" as they appear in s. 265(4) .

 

                   It is trite law
that a trial judge must instruct the jury only upon those defences for which
there is a real factual basis.  A defence for which there is no evidentiary
foundation should not be put to the jury.  This rule extends well beyond the
defence of mistaken belief in consent and is of long standing.  In Kelsey v.
The Queen, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 220, at p. 226, Fauteux J., writing
for the majority, held:

 

                   The
allotment of any substance to an argument or of any value to a grievance
resting on the omission of the trial Judge from mentioning such argument must
be conditioned on the existence in the record of some evidence or matter apt to
convey a sense of reality in the argument and in the grievance. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   In Parnerkar,
supra, it was argued that the defence of provocation must be put to the
jury if there was ""any evidence"" to support it.  Fauteux C.J.,
writing for the majority, rejected this argument.  At page 454 he wrote:

 

                   The
function assigned to the jury with respect to the particular facts mentioned in
s. 203(3) does not in any way differ from the function they have to decide all
other questions of fact, whether these facts constitute elements of a crime or
elements of an excuse  or a justification for a crime charged.  Indeed and in
all of the cases, the valid exercise of the function of the jury is, according
to the very words of the oath of office taken by them, to give a verdict
according to evidence.  They cannot go beyond the evidence and resort to
speculation nor, of course, would it be proper for the trial judge to invite
them to do so.  If, then, the record is denuded of any evidence potentially
enabling a reasonable jury acting judicially to find a wrongful act or insult
of the nature and effect set forth in s. 203(3)(a) and (b),
it is then, as a matter of law, within the area exclusively reserved to the
trial judge to so decide and his duty to refrain from putting the defence of
provocation to the jury.

 

                   There
is nothing, either expressed or necessarily implied, in the language of
s. 203(3) to indicate an intention of Parliament to modify the principle
according to which the sufficiency of evidence, which is an issue only where
there is some evidence, is a question of fact for the jury and the absence of
evidence is a question of law for the trial judge.

 

                   In R. v. Squire,
[1977] 2 S.C.R. 13, the Court again dealt with the defence of provocation and
the circumstances in which it should be put to a jury.  Spence J. cited Parnerkar,
supra, and concluded, at p. 21:

 

                   As
I have said, it is the duty of this Court to come to a decision whether those
circumstances amount to any evidence that a reasonable jury acting judicially
could find a wrongful act or insult sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of
the power of self-control (s. 215(2)), and I am strongly of the view, with
great respect to the opinion expressed by Martin J.A., that no jury acting
judicially could come to such a conclusion.

 

                   Dickson J., as he
then was, set out the two-pronged approach to defences in Faid, supra,
at pp. 276-77:

 

Whether
the accused was provoked to lose his self-control is a question of fact for the
jury.  Where an accused testifies that he killed impulsively in hot blood it
must be left to the jury to decide whether he is to be believed or not.  There
is, however, the preliminary question to be decided by the judge as a question
of law, namely, whether there was any evidence produced on which a jury could
decide that the accused acted in the heat of passion.  The question as to
whether or not there is any evidence is for the court, but subject to that the
following matters are both questions of fact for the jury, namely, (i) the
sufficiency of the particular wrongful act or insult to cause an ordinary
person to be deprived of self-control, and (ii) whether the accused was
actually deprived of his self-control....

 

Dickson J. went on to state, at p.
278:

 

                   In
the present case the question is whether there was any evidence potentially
enabling a reasonable jury acting judicially to find that Faid was deprived of the
power of self-control by the provocation that he alleged he received.

 

The question is not whether there is
some evidence, but rather, whether there is some evidence capable of supporting
the particular defence alleged by the accused.  This is made clear by the
manner in which the Court examined the evidence in Faid, at p. 278:

 

                   There
can be no doubt that a reasonable jury acting judicially could find a blow to
the head or a knife attack to be a wrongful act or insult of the nature and
effect set forth in s. 215(3).  Provocation no doubt existed here but that is
not the end of the inquiry.  The critical question to be answered in this case
was whether there was any evidence that Faid was provoked.  Was there any
evidence of passion or that he ""acted upon"" the provocation on the
sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool?  We have only his
evidence on the point and nowhere in that evidence does one find any suggestion
that as a result of the blows or other conduct of Wilson he was enraged, or
that his passions were inflamed, or that he killed in heat of blood.

 

                   There was evidence
before the jury of acts that could amount to provocation.  Yet it was not
sufficient to support the defence argued since there was no evidence that Faid
was provoked by those acts.  Thus, the trial judge should not have put that
specific defence to the jury.

 

                   The same reasoning
was applied to the defence of necessity in Morgentaler v. The Queen,
[1976] 1 S.C.R. 616.  Laskin C.J. (dissenting on another point) stated (at p.
654):

 

                   The
trial Judge in charging the jury on necessity could only have done so on the
basis that there was evidence to go to the jury on which they could make a
finding that the defence was made out.

 

Writing for the majority, at p. 659,
Pigeon J. stated:

 

In Parnerkar
v. The Queen, (at p. 454) Fauteux C.J., speaking for a majority, said:

 

If,
then, the record is denuded of any evidence potentially enabling a reasonable
jury acting judicially to find a wrongful act or insult of the nature and
effect set forth in s. 203(3)(a) and (b), it is then, as a matter
of law, within the area exclusively reserved to the trial judge to so decide
and his duty to refrain from putting the defence of provocation to the jury.

 

This
reasoning is clearly applicable to every defence, seeing that it rests on the
fundamental definition of the respective roles of judge and jury.

 

                   The same rule has
been applied in the context of self-defence.  In Brisson v. The Queen,
[1982] 2 S.C.R. 227, the Court held that there must be an air of reality to the
defence before it can be put to the jury.  McIntyre J. for the majority on this
issue stated (at p. 235):

 

                   A
trial judge must put to the jury all defences which arise from the evidence. 
There must, however, be some evidence sufficient to give an air of reality to a
defence before the obligation to put a defence can arise.

 

                   This Court again
stated the requirement that there must be evidence sufficient to give an air of
reality before a defence may be put to a jury in R. v. Aalders, [1993] 2
S.C.R. 482.  Writing for the majority, I held that the alternative verdict of
manslaughter should not have been put to the jury because in light of the
evidence presented in that case ""[t]here was no air of reality to the
defence"" (pp. 505-6).

 

                   All these cases
recognize the wise concept that the jury should only be instructed on defences
that arise from the evidence which has been tendered.  A juror should not be
required to listen to instructions on defences which simply cannot be
applicable to the case that they have heard.  The comments to this effect made
by Doherty J.A. in R. v. Haughton (1992), 11 O.R. (3d) 621, at p. 625,
are particularly appropriate.

 

                   In the realm of
sexual assault cases the requirement of sufficient evidence has caused some
confusion.  Yet in my view these words require no more than the application of
the principles that have been set out above.  In Pappajohn, supra, it
was held that the defence of mistaken belief in consent should only be put to
the jury if there was an adequate and evidentiary foundation found for it. 
There McIntyre J. writing for the majority stated that in order for the defence
to be put to the jury it must have ""an air of reality"".  He explained
that term in these words (at pp. 126-27):

 

Before
any obligation arises to put defences, there must be in the evidence some basis
upon which the defence can rest and it is only where such an evidentiary basis
is present that a trial judge must put a defence.

 

He then went on to state (at p. 133):

 

                   It
would seem to me that if it is considered necessary in this case to charge the
jury on the defence of mistake of fact, it would be necessary to do so in all
cases where the complainant denies consent and an accused asserts it.

 

                   In Bulmer, supra,
McIntyre J. had a further opportunity to explore the defence of mistake and the
air of reality requirement.  He restated his earlier position (at pp. 789-90):

 

                   It
is well settled law that in his charge the trial judge must put to the jury all
defences that may arise upon the evidence, whether they have been raised by
counsel for the defence or not.  In doing so, he is obliged to explain the law
respecting the defence and to refer the jury to the evidence which may be
relevant on that issue.  Before putting the defence, however, the trial judge
must decide whether in the facts before him the defence arises on the evidence. 
It is only when he decides this question in favour of the defence that he must
leave it to the jury, for a trial judge is not bound to put every defence
suggested by counsel in the absence of some evidentiary base.  Indeed, he
should not do so, for to put a wholly unsupported defence would only cause
confusion.

 

He then continued, at p. 791:

 

                   When
the defence of mistake of fact -- or for that matter any other defence -- is
raised, two distinct steps are involved.  The first step for the trial judge is
to decide if the defence should be put to the jury.  It is on this question, as
I have said, that the ""air of reality"" test is applied.

 

                   In a judgment
released concurrently (Robertson, supra), Wilson J., writing for the
Court, also discussed the air of reality threshold (at p. 933):

 

                   Although
there has been some difference of view on the Court as to whether the accused's
knowledge of lack of consent is to be described as an element of the offence or
as a defence of mistake of fact, the Court has been unanimous in its agreement
on one proposition -- there must be evidence that gives an air of reality to
the accused's argument that he believed the complainant was consenting before
the issue goes to the jury.

 

And further at p. 938:

 

In
my view, the inclusion of s. 244(4) [now s. 265(4) ] in the Code
makes it clear that the trial judge should not in every case instruct the jury
to consider whether the accused had an honest, though mistaken, belief in
consent.  The trial judge should only give such an instruction when certain
threshold requirements have been met.  These requirements are totally
consistent with the previous case law.

 

                   It can be seen that
this Court has consistently held that the defence of mistake of fact in a
sexual assault trial will be put to the jury so long as it meets the same
threshold requirement as that demanded of all defences.  The term ""air of
reality"" simply means that the trial judge must determine if the evidence
put forward is such that, if believed, a reasonable jury properly charged could
have acquitted.  If the evidence meets that test then the defence must be put
to the jury.  This is no more than an example of the basic division of tasks
between judge and jury.  It is the judge who must determine if evidence sought
to be adduced is relevant and admissible.  In the same way, it is the judge who
determines if there is sufficient evidence adduced to give rise to the
defence.  If there has been sufficient evidence put forward, then the jury must
be given the opportunity to consider that defence along with all the other
evidence and other defences left with them in coming to their verdict.  See Morgentaler,
supra, at p. 659, per Pigeon J.; and Wigmore on Evidence, supra,
at p. 976.  

 

                   The jury system has
in general functioned exceptionally well.  Its importance has been recognized
in s. 11 (f) of the Charter .  One of the reasons it has
functioned so very well is that trial judges have been able to direct the minds
of jurors to the essential elements of the offence and to those defences which
are applicable.  That process should be maintained.  The charge to the jury
must be directed to the essential elements of the crime with which the accused
is charged and defences to it.  Speculative defences that are unfounded should
not be presented to the jury.  To do so would be wrong, confusing, and
unnecessarily lengthen jury trials.

 

                   In coming to a
conclusion as to the sufficiency of the evidence pertaining to a defence, the
trial judge must consider all the evidence and all the circumstances.  It is
only when the totality of the evidence tendered at the trial has been taken
into account and considered in the light of all the relevant circumstances that
the trial judge will be in a position to make a ruling.  See Bulmer, supra,
at pp. 790-91, and Squire, supra, at p. 21.  

 

                   In what
circumstances will it be appropriate to consider a defence of mistaken belief
in consent?  It is the position of the intervener, the Attorney General for
Ontario, that the defence cannot arise in situations where the evidence of the
complainant and the accused are diametrically opposed.  For example, if the
accused states that there was willing consent and the complainant denies any
consent then the defence simply cannot arise.  In such circumstances for a jury
to accept the defence of mistaken belief in consent it would have to reject all
the evidence given at the trial including that tendered by both the complainant
(no consent) and that of the accused (willing consent).  Indeed in order to
give effect to the defence a jury would have to speculate upon and give effect
to a third version of events which was not in evidence.  See, for example, R.
v. Guthrie (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 73 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 83-84.

 

                   McIntyre J.
adverted to this issue when he stated in Pappajohn, supra, at pp.
133-34:

 

                   Where
the complainant says rape and the accused says consent, and where on the whole
of the evidence, including that of the complainant, the accused, and the
surrounding circumstances, there is a clear issue on this point, and where as
here the accused makes no assertion of a belief in consent as opposed to an
actual consent, it is unrealistic in the absence of some other circumstance or
circumstances ...to consider the judge bound to put the mistake of fact
defence.

 

                   This point was also
made in the House of Lords decision in Director of Public Prosecutions v.
Morgan, [1976] A.C. 182.  Lord Cross explained at p. 204:

 

So,
as the judge made clear at the outset of his summing up, the only real issue in
the case was whether what took place in the Morgan's house that night was a
multiple rape or a sexual orgy.  The jury obviously considered that the
appellants' evidence as to the part played by Mrs. Morgan was a pack of
lies and one must assume that any other jury would take the same view as to the
relative credibility of the parties.  That any jury which thought that the
grounds for a belief in consent put forward by the defendants, which if truly
held would have been eminently reasonable, were in fact never entertained by
them at all, should in the same breath hold that they may have had an honest
belief in consent based on different and unreasonable grounds is inconceivable.

 

Lord Hailsham stated the issue as
follows, at p. 207:

 

                   The
choice before the jury was thus between two stories each wholly incompatible
with the other, and in my opinion it would have been quite sufficient for the
judge, after suitable warnings about the burden of proof, corroboration,
separate verdicts and the admissibility of the statements only against the
makers, to tell the jury that they must really choose between the two versions,
the one of a violent and unmistakable rape of a singularly unpleasant kind, and
the other of active co-operation in a sexual orgy, always remembering that if
in reasonable doubt as to which was true they must give the defendants the
benefit of it.  In spite of the valiant attempts of counsel to suggest some way
in which the stories could be taken apart in sections and give rise in some way
to a situation which might conceivably have been acceptable to a reasonable
jury in which, while the victim was found not to have consented, the
appellants, or any of them could conceivably either reasonably or unreasonably
have thought she did consent, I am utterly unable to see any conceivable
half-way house.  The very material which could have introduced doubt into
matter of consent goes equally to belief and vice versa.

 

See also:  Bratty v.
Attorney-General for Northern Ireland, [1963] A.C. 386 (H.L.).

 

                   I agree with this
position.  The defence of mistake may arise when the accused and the
complainant tell essentially the same story and then argue that they
interpreted it differently.  Realistically it can only arise when the facts
described by the complainant and the accused generally correspond but the
interpretation of those facts leads to a different state of mind for each of
the parties.  In a situation where the evidence given is directly opposed as to
whether there was consent, the defence of mistake as to consent simply cannot
exist.  However, even in the absence of that defence, the jury will nonetheless
be bound to acquit if it has a reasonable doubt as to whether there was consent
in light of the conflicting evidence on the issue.  Lack of consent is an
integral element of the offence.  In cases where there is conflicting evidence
on the issue the trial judge will always direct the jury that they must be
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that consent was lacking.

 

                   It should be emphasized
once again that the defence of mistaken belief in consent will be invoked
rarely.  In the vast majority of cases a sexual assault does not occur as a
result of accident or mistake.  It is simply not a crime that lends itself to
commission by mistake or by accident.  As Dickson J. dissenting in Pappajohn,
supra, stated, at p. 155, it is not a crime that is committed per
incuriam.  Indeed it may well be appropriate for a trial judge to charge a
jury that in the usual course of events this is not a crime that can be
committed accidentally.

 

                   (2)  Evidentiary
Burden of Section 265(4) 

 

                   The next question
that must be addressed is what evidence must be adduced before the trial judge
should put the defence of mistake to the jury.  This issue has caused some
confusion.  In Pappajohn, supra, at p. 133, McIntyre J. stated:

 

To
require the putting of the alternative defence of mistaken belief in consent,
there must be, in my opinion, some evidence beyond the mere assertion of
belief in consent by counsel for the appellant.  This evidence must
appear from or be supported by sources other than the appellant in order to
give it any air of reality.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   McIntyre J.
clarified his position in Bulmer, supra, at p. 790:

 

There
will not be an air of reality about a mere statement that ""I thought she
was consenting"" not supported to some degree by other evidence or
circumstances arising in the case.  If that mere assertion were sufficient
to require a trial judge to put the ""mistake of fact"" defence, it
would be a simple matter in any rape case to make such an assertion and,
regardless of all other circumstances, require the defence to be put. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   The question that
arises is whether this means that in order for the defence to be put to the jury
there must be some evidence of mistaken belief in consent emanating from a
source other than the accused.  In my view, this proposition cannot be
correct.  There is no requirement that there be evidence independent of the
accused in order to have the defence put to the jury.  However, the mere
assertion by the accused that ""I believed she was consenting"" will
not be sufficient.  What is required is that the defence of mistaken belief be
supported by evidence beyond the mere assertion of a mistaken belief.  In the
words of the Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest, there must be more than a
""facile mouthing of some easy phrase of excuse"" (Bratty, supra,
at p. 417).  

 

                   In order to have
the defence put to the jury the same requirement must be satisfied as for all
other defences.  Just as a defence of provocation will not be put to the jury
on the basis of the bare assertion of the accused that ""I was
provoked"", see Faid, supra, at p. 278, so too the bare assertion of
the accused that ""I thought she was consenting"" will not warrant
putting the defence of mistaken belief in consent to the jury.  The requisite
evidence may come from the detailed testimony of the accused alone, on this
issue or from the testimony of the accused coupled with evidence from other
sources.  For example, the complainant's testimony may supply the requisite
evidence.

 

                   In the case at bar,
the Court of Appeal correctly held that the trial judge erred in finding that
the defence of mistake was unavailable on the basis of the accused's evidence
alone.  However, it erred in finding that there could be no air of reality to
the defence on the basis that the complainant had been kidnapped by the
appellant.  The basic premise that Southin J.A. elaborated is correct.  That is
to say the belief by a convicted kidnapper that his victim consented to a
sexual assault on the occasion of the kidnapping has no air of reality. 
However, in this case there had not been a previous or separate conviction on
the kidnapping charge.  Indeed, the mens rea for the kidnapping charge
and that for the sexual assault were so closely connected as to be
inseparable.  The kidnapping could not therefore be used as the grounds for
rejecting the defence of mistake.

 

(3) 
Constitutionality of Section 265(4) 

 

(i) The
Presumption of Innocence:  Section 11 (d)

 

                   The fundamental
principle protected by s. 11 (d) is the guarantee of a right to be
presumed innocent, that is, that an accused is not to be convicted when there
exists a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.  Any law which places a persuasive
burden on the accused to prove either the existence or non-existence of a fact
essential to guilt will infringe upon the right guaranteed by s. 11 (d).
 As I have indicated, all criminal defences must meet a threshold requirement
of sufficient evidence, or in other words, an air of reality, before the trial
judge should leave them with a jury.  In my view this does not violate the
presumption of innocence.

 

                   This Court has
earlier had occasion to consider whether such a requirement places an
unacceptable reverse onus of proof on the accused.  For example, in Perka v.
The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 232, Dickson J. discussed this issue in relation
to the defence of necessity (at pp. 257-58):

 

                   Although
necessity is spoken of as a defence, in the sense that it is raised by the
accused, the Crown always bears the burden of proving a voluntary act.  The
prosecution must prove every element of the crime charged.  One such element is
the voluntariness of the act.  Normally, voluntariness can be presumed, but if
the accused places before the Court, through his own witnesses or through
cross-examination of Crown witnesses, evidence sufficient to raise an issue
that the situation created by external forces was so emergent that failure to
act could endanger life or health and upon any reasonable view of the facts,
compliance with the law was impossible, then the Crown must be prepared to meet
that issue.  There is no onus of proof on the accused.

 

In conclusion he stated at p. 259:

 

...
where the accused places before the Court sufficient evidence to raise the
issue, the onus is on the Crown to meet it beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

                   The distinction
between a burden of proof with regard to an offence or an element of the
offence, and an evidentiary burden is critical.  It must be remembered that the
accused only bears the evidentiary burden of raising the issue of mistake, and
in fact, only bears that burden if sufficient evidence has not already been
raised by the prosecution's case.  The reasons of Wilson J. in Robertson,
supra, at p. 933, deal with this issue:

 

In
addition, I believe that previous case law establishes the proposition that,
where there is sufficient evidence for the issue to go to the jury, the Crown
bears the burden of persuading the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused knew the complainant was not consenting or was reckless as to whether
she was consenting or not.  Using the language of Glanville Williams in Criminal
Law:  The General Part (2nd ed. 1961), at pp. 871-910, there are two
separate burdens in relation to the issue of honest but mistaken belief -- the
evidentiary burden and the burden of persuasion.  Evidence must be introduced
that satisfies the judge that the issue should be put to the jury.  This
evidence may be introduced by the Crown or by the defence.  The accused bears
the evidentiary burden only in the limited sense that, if there is nothing in
the Crown's case to indicate that the accused honestly believed in the
complainant's consent, then the accused will have to introduce evidence if he
wishes the issue to reach the jury.  Once the issue is put to the jury the
Crown bears the risk of not being able to persuade the jury of the accused's
guilt.

 

McIntyre J. also made this fundamental
distinction in Pappajohn, supra, at p. 127:

 

                   What
is the standard which the judge must apply in considering this question? 
Ordinarily, when there is any evidence of a matter of fact, the proof of which
may be relevant to the guilt or innocence of an accused, the trial judge must
leave that evidence to the jury so that they may reach their own conclusion
upon it.  Where, however, the trial judge is asked to put a specific defence to
the jury, he is not concerned only with the existence or non-existence of
evidence of fact.  He must consider, assuming that the evidence relied upon by
the accused to support a defence is true, whether that evidence is sufficient
to justify the putting of the defence.

 

                   Section 265(4)  does
not create a statutory presumption.  The accused seeking to raise the defence
of mistaken belief only bears a tactical evidentiary burden.  This point was
made by Wilson J. in Robertson, supra, at pp. 936:

 

                   There
is an evidentiary burden on the accused but (and this, in my opinion, is the
important point) if there is sufficient evidence to put the issue before the
jury, then the Crown has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that
the accused did not have an honest belief as to consent.  The defence of
mistake, as Dickson J. pointed out in Pappajohn, is simply a denial of mens
rea which does not involve the accused in a burden of proof.

 

                   This position is
supported by Professor Hogg:

 

...
the presumption of innocence would not be infringed by a provision that imposed
on the accused the burden of adducing sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable
doubt as to the presence or absence of some fact that is an element of the
offence, a collateral factor, an excuse or a defence.  An evidentiary burden of
this kind does not infringe s. 11 (d), because a conviction could be avoided
simply by the accused raising a reasonable doubt in the mind of the
trier of fact.  [Emphasis in original.]

(Constitutional Law of Canada
(3rd ed. 1992), vol. 2, at p. 48-15.)

 

                   Section 265(4) 
leaves the burden on the Crown in regard to all the essential elements of the
offence.  The prosecution must prove both the mens rea and the actus
reus beyond a reasonable doubt:  that the accused engaged in sexual
intercourse with a woman who was not consenting, and that he intended to engage
in sexual intercourse without the consent of the woman.  It is always open to
the jury even without the defence of mistake of fact as to consent to find that
there was a reasonable doubt as to the accused's mens rea and acquit. 
The mere fact of the air of reality requirement does not displace the
presumption of innocence.

 

                   In conclusion,
then, the air of reality threshold set forth in s. 265(4)  does not violate
s. 11 (d).  While it creates an evidentiary burden on the accused in the
sense that he must raise sufficient evidence to give the defence an air of
reality to justify its presentation to the jury, the burden of proving all of
the elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt rests squarely with the
Crown.

 

(ii)Right
to a Trial by Jury:  Section 11 (f)

 

                   Section 11 (f)
confers on a person charged with an offence the right to be tried by a jury
where the maximum punishment for the offence is imprisonment for five years or
more.

 

                   It is a basic tenet
of the jury system that the jury decides issues of fact while the judge
determines questions of law.  Whether there is sufficient evidence to determine
if an issue has been properly raised is a question of law, and therefore is
properly in the domain of the judge (Bulmer, supra, at pp. 790-91 and
796).

 

                   The requirement
that there be an air of reality to the defence of mistaken belief in consent
set out in s. 265(4)  is reasonable and entirely valid.  It is no more than
a reaffirmation of an integral part of the judge's role in supervising a jury
trial.  The trial judge must determine questions of law such as the relevance
and admissibility of evidence and the competence and compellability of
witnesses.  In doing so the trial judge cannot be accused of usurping the role
of the jury or violating the accused's rights.  Similarly it is appropriate
that the judge determine if there is sufficient evidence to raise the defence
of mistaken belief in consent.  In considering the evidence giving rise to the
air of reality, it must be remembered that the trial judge is not weighing the
evidence, but is simply examining it to determine what defences are available. 
See Guthrie, supra, at p. 84.

 

                   The appellant was
provided with a trial by jury.  The only elements of the trial that were
decided by the trial judge were those things properly within his realm, namely
those issues pertaining to trial process and questions of law.  There is
consequently no violation of the appellant's right to a trial by jury.

 

                   (iii) 
Section 1

 

                   As I have concluded
that the air of reality threshold contained in s. 265(4)  violates neither
s. 11 (d) or s. 11 (f) there is no need to consider s. 1 
of the Charter .

 

IV.  Disposition

 

                   The appeal should
be allowed and a new trial ordered on the ground that the trial judge erred in
failing to allow the cross-examination of the complainant on her medical
records.  That cross-examination should be allowed to the extent that it would
comply with these reasons.

 

                   The constitutional
questions should be answered as follows:

 

1.If
s. 265(4) of the Criminal Code  imposes an ""air of reality
test"" as a threshold to be met before the issue of mistaken belief is left
to the jury, does the subsection limit the right to be presumed innocent as
guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
or the right to a trial by jury as guaranteed by s. 11 (f) of the Charter ?

 

                   No.

                   J and the accused
were charged with first degree murder following the killing of J's employer.  J
believed that the victim, with whom he had a homosexual relationship, had
brought in a new employee to take his place.  On the night of the murder, the
accused drove J to the victim's antique shop.  According to J, the accused
never left the car and was unaware of what happened in the shop.  J admitted to
entering the shop, losing control and striking the victim with a hammer.  The
accused gave a different story.  According to him, J talked on the way to the
shop about killing the victim, although the accused took this to be a joke.  J
got out of the car carrying a hammer, balaclava and gloves, and ordered the
accused to follow him.  J entered the shop and the accused remained outside
near the door where he heard loud voices and noises, suggesting that someone
was getting hit.  The accused became frightened and ran down the driveway
toward the car.  J ran after him, hit him and forced him to return to the
shop.  He then told the accused to retrieve the cash box.  The Crown's theory
was that J and the accused both entered the shop and both participated fully in
the attacks as well as the robbery.  The trial judge charged the jury on both
murder and manslaughter.  He set out a number of plausible scenarios but in
none of them was it suggested that the accused might be guilty of
manslaughter.  Rather, the trial judge expressed the opinion that this was
unlikely.  The jury found J guilty of first degree murder and the accused of
second degree murder.  The Court of Appeal set aside the accused's conviction
and directed a new trial on the ground that the trial judge did not adequately
instruct the jury as to the accused's potential liability for manslaughter
under ss. 21(1)  and 21(2)  of the Criminal Code .

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
dismissed.

 

                   Per La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  A person who
aids and abets another in the offence of murder can be guilty of that offence
under s. 21(1)(b) and (c) of the Code if he possesses
the requisite mens rea for murder.  Where the aider and abettor does not
have the mens rea required for murder, he may be guilty of the lesser
offence of manslaughter if he possesses the requisite mens rea for that
offence.  Unlawful act manslaughter under s. 21(1) (b) and (c)
does not require a subjective appreciation of the consequences of the act.  The
test is objective.  Nor is it necessary that the risk of death be foreseeable. 
As long as the unlawful act is inherently dangerous and harm to another which
is neither trivial nor transitory is its foreseeable consequence, the resultant
death amounts to manslaughter.  A person may thus be convicted of manslaughter
who aids and abets another person in the offence of murder, where a reasonable
person in all the circumstances would have appreciated that bodily harm was the
foreseeable consequence of the dangerous act which was being undertaken.

 

 

                   As well, under
s. 21(2) of the Code, where a common unlawful purpose has been
demonstrated and one party to the purpose has committed murder, another party
to the purpose may be convicted of either murder or manslaughter.  The offence
referred to in s. 21(2)  is not confined to the offence of which the
perpetrator is convicted but extends to included offences.  The appropriate mens
rea for manslaughter under s. 21(2)  is objective awareness of the risk
of harm.  It follows that a conviction for manslaughter under s. 21(2) 
does not require foreseeability of death, but only foreseeability of harm,
which in fact results in death.   A party to a common intention to carry out an
unlawful purpose under s. 21(2)  may thus be guilty of manslaughter, even
though the perpetrator was guilty of murder, if he did not foresee the
probability of murder but a reasonable person in all the circumstances would
have foreseen at least a risk of harm to another as a result of carrying out
the common intention.

 

                   Here, the accused
was entitled to have the verdict of manslaughter clearly put to the jury.  The
evidence adduced at trial was capable of supporting a conviction for manslaughter
on the basis that the accused was an aider and abettor under s. 21(1)  or
that he was a party to a common intention to carry out an unlawful purpose
under s. 21(2) .  It was thus essential that the jury be instructed with
respect to the accused's potential liability for manslaughter under these
sections.  Given the trial judge's failure to set out the basis for convicting
the accused of manslaughter under ss. 21(1)  and 21(2)  and the absence of
any instruction that a party may be guilty of manslaughter even though the
perpetrator is guilty of murder, one cannot be satisfied that the verdict was
just.  This was not a proper case for the application of s. 686(1)(b)(iii)
of the Code.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J.:  The reasons of
McLachlin J. were generally agreed with.  In particular, an accused can be
convicted of manslaughter under s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code  if
the accused, having formed an intention in common to carry out an unlawful
purpose and to assist the perpetrator therein, knew or ought to have known that
a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose was the carrying out
by the perpetrator of a dangerous act which a reasonable person could recognize
as creating the risk of bodily harm which is neither trivial nor transitory. 
No Charter issue was raised in this appeal.

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   Lamer
C.J. -- I agree with Justice
McLachlin's proposed disposition of this appeal and generally with her
reasons.  In particular, I agree that having regard to the decisions of this
Court in R. v. Trinneer, [1970] S.C.R. 638, R. v. Kirkness,
[1990] 3 S.C.R. 74, and R. v. Creighton, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3, an accused
can be convicted of manslaughter under s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , if the accused, having formed an intention in common to
carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist the perpetrator therein, knew or
ought to have known that a probable consequence of carrying out the common
purpose was the carrying out by the perpetrator of a dangerous act which a
reasonable person could recognize as creating the risk of bodily harm which is
neither trivial nor transitory.  

 

                   In so holding, I
would emphasize that the Court is not here concerned with any issue under the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , no such point having been raised or argued.

 

                   The judgment of La
Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci and Major
JJ. was delivered by

 

                   McLachlin
J. -- Paul Benjamin Davy
stands convicted of the second degree murder of Eugene Rae.  The Court of
Appeal of Ontario ordered a new trial on the ground that the charge to the jury
did not adequately describe the alternative of manslaughter.  The Crown now
appeals to this Court.

 

                   Two issues arise on
this appeal.  The first concerns the principles which govern a conviction for
manslaughter.  The second is whether the charge given by the trial judge was in
conformity with those principles.  

 

The Background

 

                     Davy was charged,
together with Ricky Allan Jackson, with the first degree murder of Eugene Rae
which took place in the early morning of August 27, 1986.  Mr. Rae was the
owner of an antique shop, the Raebenloft, in the town of Bobcaygeon.  His
living quarters were in the shop.  Jackson had worked for Rae in the shop and
had been Rae's lover. 

 

                   In the summer of
1986, Rae hired a 19-year-old man named Michael Pearson.  Jackson became
concerned that Pearson would replace him in the shop and in Rae's affections. 
Jackson and Rae argued about Pearson and Rae assured Jackson that Pearson would
be leaving.

 

                   On the night of the
murder, Jackson was visiting Davy and his wife in their home in Orillia when he
decided to telephone Rae.  Upon doing so, he learned that, despite Rae's
promise, Pearson was at the Raebenloft with him.  Upset, Jackson asked Davy to
drive him to Bobcaygeon.

 

                   Here the stories of
Jackson and Davy diverge.  According to Jackson, Davy never left the car and
was unaware of the events that subsequently took place in the Raebenloft. 
Jackson admitted to entering the shop, losing control and striking Rae with a
hammer.  He was unable to say how many times he struck Rae.  He also recalled
chasing Pearson up the stairs, catching and hitting him about three-quarters of
the way up and then seeing Pearson lying beside the bed.  The next thing he remembered
was being out in Davy's car and giving him directions back to Orillia.

 

                   Davy's story was
quite different.  According to him, Jackson talked on the way to Bobcaygeon
about killing Rae, although Davy took this to be a joke.  Upon their arrival in
Bobcaygeon, they parked the car across the street from the Raebenloft.  Jackson
got out, carrying a hammer, balaclava and gloves, and ordered Davy to follow
him.  Jackson entered the shop and Davy remained outside, near the door.  Davy
saw another person in the house with Jackson and heard loud voices and
""three smacks"".  Davy then became frightened and ran down the
driveway toward the car.  Jackson ran after him, hit him and forced him to
return to the shop.  He told Davy to retrieve a cash box from the floor before
they returned to the car, whereupon Jackson ordered Davy to drive back to
Orillia.  Jackson disposed of the hammer and some stolen property on the way.

 

                   Pearson testified
that he had been awakened by screaming from the deceased and then heard a thumping
sound.  He remained upstairs, hiding behind the bed, until he saw Jackson in
the room looking at him.  He stood up and asked Jackson what was going on.  He
testified that he did not see any other person in the room and that he recalls
nothing after that until he awoke in the hospital with head wounds.

 

                   Forensic evidence
revealed the impressions of two different pairs of running shoes at the scene. 
One pair had a wavy pattern, the other a lug pattern.  The wavy prints were
found at various places in the downstairs living area and shop and some of them
were marked in blood.  The lug prints were found at the south end of the bed
and halfway between the bed and the doorway leading into the store front. 
These prints bore no evidence of blood.

 

                   The lug shoes were
found in Jackson's car on his arrest and Jackson testified that they were his. 
However, Davy testified that the lug shoes were his, that they had been worn by
him on the night of the killing and that he had given them to Jackson on
Jackson's orders later.  Jackson, he said, wore shoes with a wavy tread. 
Expert evidence was called which suggested that the lug shoes had been
routinely worn by Davy.

 

                   On the basis of
this evidence a number of scenarios may be constructed.  The strength and
plausibility of each depends upon the credibility of each witness and the
weight which might be ascribed to each piece of evidence.  The jury could have
found that Davy had nothing to do with the murder and must be acquitted.  Or,
the jury could have found that Davy assisted Jackson in the activities that led
to the murder or the robbery.  On yet another scenario, proffered by the Crown,
Jackson and Davy both entered Raebenloft and both participated fully in the
attacks as well as the robbery.  Davy's fate at trial depended upon the
scenario chosen and the conclusions drawn as to duress and his state of mind.

 

                   The trial judge
charged the jury on both the law of murder and of manslaughter.  In doing so,
he emphasized that the jury should consider each accused's liability
independently.  He set out a number of plausible scenarios and stated what the
liability of each accused would be under each.  In none of the scenarios was it
suggested that Davy might be guilty of manslaughter.  Rather, the trial judge
expressed the opinion that it was unlikely that Davy would be guilty of
manslaughter.  The jury, as noted, convicted Davy of second degree murder.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
set aside Davy's conviction and directed a new trial on the ground that the
judge's charge did not adequately deal with the possibility that he might be
guilty of manslaughter:  (1991), 51 O.A.C. 92, 68 C.C.C. (3d) 385, 9 C.R. (4th)
57.

Discussion

 

(1)   Manslaughter and its
Application in this Case

 

                   The main objection
to the charge is that the trial judge failed to properly instruct the jury with
respect to Davy's potential liability for manslaughter through the application
of ss. 21(1) (b), 21(1) (c) and 21(2)  of the Criminal Code .

 

(i) Aiding
and Abetting:  Section 21(1) (b) and (c)

 

                   I turn first to
Davy's potential liability for manslaughter as an aider and abettor under s.
21(1) (b) and (c).  A person is a party to an offence if he or she
aids or abets the commission of it.  In this case, Jackson committed the
offence of murder.  It was open on the evidence for the jury to find that Davy
aided and abetted him in that offence, and is guilty under s. 21(1) (b)
and (c) of the Criminal Code .  If he possessed the necessary mens
rea for murder he could be guilty of murder.  In the event that the jury
did not find the intent required for murder, the question arises whether and in
what circumstances Davy could be convicted under s. 21(1)  for the lesser
offence of manslaughter.

 

                   The trial judge did
not give the jury a specific direction that it could find Davy guilty of
manslaughter as an aider and abettor under s. 21(1)  of the Criminal Code . 
The Court of Appeal held that this was an error.  It held that the trial
judge should have told the jury that s. 21(1)(b) and (c) of the Code
would lead to a verdict of manslaughter if Davy did not have the mental
state required for murder but the unlawful act which was aided or abetted was
one he knew was likely to cause some harm short of death.  This follows from
the decision of this Court in R. v. Kirkness, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 74, at p.
88, per Cory J., where it was held that a person who aids and abets in
an attack which results in a death may be guilty of manslaughter where that
person does not have the requisite mens rea for murder but possesses the
requisite intention for manslaughter, and where his co-accused is guilty of
murder.  (See also Wilson J., at pp. 96-97.)

 

                   I agree with the
Court of Appeal that the jury could have convicted Davy of manslaughter under
these sections while convicting Jackson of murder.

 

                   I differ from the
Court of Appeal, however, in the state of mind required to be guilty of
manslaughter under s. 21(1) (b) and (c).  The Court of Appeal held
that the test was a subjective appreciation that the act was likely to cause
some harm short of death.  Since the date of the Court of Appeal's decision,
this Court has held that unlawful act manslaughter -- that is, the killing of a
person while engaged in an unlawful act -- does not require a subjective
appreciation of the consequences of the act.  The test is objective -- what a
reasonable person would have appreciated in all the circumstances.  Nor is it
necessary that the risk of death be foreseeable.  As long as the unlawful act
is inherently dangerous and harm to another which is neither trivial nor
transitory is its foreseeable consequence, the resultant death amounts to
manslaughter: R. v. Creighton, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3; see also R.
v. DeSousa, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944.

 

                   I conclude that a
person may be convicted of manslaughter who aids and abets another person in
the offence of murder, where a reasonable person in all the circumstances would
have appreciated that bodily harm was the foreseeable consequence of the
dangerous act which was being undertaken.  I further conclude that Davy might
fall within this rule on the evidence presented at trial.

 

(ii)
Common Unlawful Purpose: Section 21(2) 

 

                   I turn next to
Davy's potential liability for manslaughter under s. 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code , the ""common purpose"" section.

 

                   In my view, the
trial judge correctly instructed the jury on the potential liability of Davy
for murder under s. 21(2) .  He told the jury that if Davy formed a common
intention with Jackson to rob the deceased and Jackson committed murder in the
course of carrying out that robbery and foresaw that the murder was a probable
consequence of carrying out the robbery or common purpose, then Davy would be
guilty of second degree murder.  

 

                   The trial judge,
however, did not tell the jury that they could find Davy guilty of manslaughter
under s. 21(2) .  The Court of Appeal held that this was an error, and that he
should have instructed the jury that if they found Jackson guilty of murder, it
was open to them under s. 21(2)  to find Davy guilty of manslaughter.

 

                   This raises the
question of whether a party may be found guilty of manslaughter under s. 21(2) 
where the perpetrator of the offence under that section is found guilty of
murder.  In other words, is the offence referred to in s. 21(2)  confined to the
offence of which the perpetrator is convicted -- in this case murder -- or does
it extend to included offences such as manslaughter?  If it is found to extend
to included offences, then the further question arises of the required mens
rea for manslaughter under s. 21(2) .

 

                   Canadian courts
have divided on the question of whether s. 21(2)  imposes liability for included
offences.  In British Columbia and New Brunswick, appellate courts have held
that a party cannot be convicted of manslaughter under s. 21(2)  where the
perpetrator is convicted of murder: R. v. Wong (1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d)
196 (B.C.C.A.), at pp. 200-202; and Hébert v. R. (1986), 51 C.R. (3d)
264 (N.B.C.A.).  On the other hand, in Alberta and Manitoba the contrary view
has been taken: R. v. Emkeit (1971), 3 C.C.C. (2d) 309 (Alta. C.A.), at
pp. 336-37; and R. v. Kent (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 405 (Man. C.A.), at
pp. 431-32.

                   

                   In this case, the
Court of Appeal took the view that where a common unlawful purpose has been
demonstrated and one party to the purpose has committed murder, another party
to the purpose may be convicted of either murder or manslaughter.  Its reasons
may be summarized as follows.

 

                   First, the Court of
Appeal held that while Kirkness, supra, does not finally decide the
issue, its reasoning supports the conclusion that liability under s. 21(2)  may
extend to included offences.

 

                   Second, the Court
of Appeal held that the wording of the section admits of this conclusion.  It
is true that the reference in s. 21(2) ,  to ""an offence"" committed by
the principal, followed by the phrases ""the offence"" and ""that offence""
describing the second person's liability, suggest at first reading that the
second person's liability must be for the same offence as the principal's
liability, in this case murder.  However, if ""the offence"" and
""that offence"" are read as encompassing all included offences, a
different conclusion emerges.  Doherty J.A. wrote (at p. 420 C.C.C.):

 

The
accessory is liable for ""the offence"" committed by the perpetrator. 
If the perpetrator commits murder, he or she necessarily commits the offence of
manslaughter, although liability for manslaughter, being a lesser and included
offence in murder, is subsumed in the conviction for murder. . . .  The
accessory's liability under s. 21(2)  is properly addressed in relation to each
of the incidental offences committed by the perpetrator, not just by reference
to the offence to which the perpetrator is ultimately convicted.

 

                   Third, the Court of
Appeal held that interpreting s. 21(2)  in this way ""maintains an
appropriate equilibrium between moral culpability and the offence for which an
accused is ultimately convicted"" (p. 420 C.C.C.).   Doherty J.A. cited
Cooke J. (as he then was) in R. v. Tomkins, [1985] 2 N.Z.L.R. 253
(C.A.), at p. 255:

 

                   The
availability of manslaughter as a verdict in such cases gives effect to the
community's sense that a man who joins in a criminal enterprise with the
knowledge that knives (or other weapons such as loaded guns) are being carried
should bear a share of criminal responsibility for an ensuing death; but that,
if he did not think that the weapons would be intentionally used to kill, it
may be unduly harsh to convict him of murder.

 

                   These considerations,
taken together, led the Court of Appeal to conclude that a person can be
convicted of manslaughter under s. 21(2) of the Code where the principal
is guilty of murder.  While the matter admits of difficulty,  I think that the
Court of Appeal in the end arrived at the correct result, bearing in mind not
only the wording of the Code but the manifest justice of permitting a
conviction for manslaughter in these circumstances.  In arriving at this
conclusion, I have not ignored the history of s. 21(2) , which at one time
referred to ""every offence"" (R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, s. 69(2)).  The
change is arguably equally consistent with the theory that ""offence""
encompasses included offences, as with the Crown's theory that the drafters of
the Criminal Code  were seeking to limit it to the principal's offence.

 

                   This leaves the
question of the mens rea required to sustain a conviction for
manslaughter under s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code .  The Court of Appeal
held that to be convicted of manslaughter under s. 21(2) of the Code,
the Crown must establish that the accused knew or ought to have known that killing
short of murder was a probable consequence of the pursuit of the common
unlawful purpose.  However, as was previously noted, since the date of the
Court of Appeal's decision, this Court has held that manslaughter does not
require that a risk of death be foreseeable; foreseeability of the risk of harm
is sufficient: Creighton, supra.  This Court's decision in R. v.
Trinneer, [1970] S.C.R. 638, suggests that there is nothing inherent in s.
21(2)  which requires a higher mens rea than would otherwise be required
for a conviction for manslaughter.  There the Court held unanimously that an
accused could be convicted of constructive murder as a party to that offence
under the combination of ss. 21(2)  and 230  (then s. 202 ) of the Criminal
Code , without the Crown proving that the accused knew or ought to have
known that it was probable death would ensue from the execution of the common
unlawful purpose.  While it would no longer be possible to convict for murder 
under s. 21(2)  without proof of subjective awareness of the risk of death (R.
v. Logan, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 731),  the reasoning in Trinneer,
coupled with Creighton, supra, suggests that the appropriate mens
rea  for manslaughter under s. 21(2)  is objective awareness of the risk of
harm.   It must follow that a conviction for manslaughter under s. 21(2) 
does not require foreseeability of death, but only foreseeability of harm,
which in fact results in death.

 

                   On the evidence
presented, one of the scenarios available to the jury was that Jackson and Davy
had formed a common intention to rob Rae and that, in the course of the
robbery, Jackson murdered Rae.  Even if he did not participate in the murder,
Davy could be liable under s. 21(2)  in this scenario.  If he foresaw that
murder was a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose -- in this
case the robbery -- he would be guilty of second degree murder.  On the other
hand, if Davy did not foresee the probability of murder but a reasonable person
in all the circumstances would have foreseen at least a risk of harm to another
as a result of carrying out the common intention, Davy could be found guilty of
manslaughter under s. 21(2) .

 

                   To summarize, the
evidence was capable of supporting a conviction for manslaughter on the bases
that Davy was an aider and abettor under s. 21(1)  of the Criminal Code 
or that he was a party to a common intention to carry out an unlawful purpose
under s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code .  The remaining question is whether
the jury was correctly charged with respect to these options.

 

                   (iii) Adequacy
of the Charge on Manslaughter

 

                   The trial judge, as
part of his general direction on the law, charged the jury on manslaughter as
follows:

                   

                   Let
us then assume that you have a reasonable doubt as to second degree murder, or,
as I have called it, murder.  We will then turn to manslaughter.

 

                   If
you find that Eugene Rae died as the result of an unlawful act and that the
accused committed, or was a party to that unlawful act, but you are not
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that one of the accused had the intent
required for murder, then you will find the accused not guilty of murder but
guilty of manslaughter.  No intention to kill -- I repeat, no intention to kill
-- or no intention to cause bodily harm of the nature I have described need be
proved by the Crown to sustain a verdict of manslaughter.  Manslaughter simply
is the unintentional killing resulting from an unlawful act, but the Crown must
satisfy you beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused killed Rae by means of
an unlawful act that the accused committed upon Rae, or was a party thereto. 
Here, the unlawful act would be assault, a non-accidental application of force.

 

                   Keep
in mind that Mr. Owen [defence counsel for Jackson] has conceded that Jackson
is guilty in the least of manslaughter, that is, the unlawful act of assaulting
Rae caused Rae's death.

 

                   The trial judge
gave the following directions on party liability:

 

                   All
parties to the offence are equally guilty.  There are two accused here.  You
must consider their liability separately.  In that regard, you must determine
whether Jackson or Davy are parties to first degree murder, second degree
murder, or manslaughter.  A party to an offence is guilty of the murder whether
he is a principal or secondary offender.

 

                   The trial judge
charged on aiding and abetting as follows:

 

                   I
turn next to aiding and abetting an offence.  Each is a separate mode by which
an accused may be a secondary party to an offence actually committed by some
other person.  Before a person can be liable as an aider or abettor, you must
find that a specific offence, in this case first degree murder, second degree
murder or manslaughter, was committed.  If you find that the offence has been
committed, then the accused would be guilty if he aided, or abetted, in the
commission of the offence.

 

                   Aiding
or abetting must relate to a specific offence.  You cannot aid, or abet, in the
abstract.  The word ""aid"", of course, simply means to help, or
assist.  The helping may consist of doing something.  The word ""abet""
means to encourage, to urge on, to incite, to instigate.

 

                   Persons
who actually aid, or abet, in the commission of an offence are as guilty of the
offence as the person who actually commits it.  To be guilty of aiding or
abetting, there must be some actual participation or assistance rendered, or
some active encouraging or urging that the offence be carried out.  A mere
bystander is not an aider or abettor.  Passive acquiescence is not sufficient.

 

                   To
aid, or abet the venture; to aid, or abet, the commission of a crime, a person
must associate himself with a criminal venture by participating in it and
trying to make it succeed, or by actively encouraging it, or urging that it
occur.  Remember, it is no criminal offence to stand by.  A mere passive
spectator to a crime, no matter how serious the offence, is not guilty of an
offence.  There must be intentional assistance or encouragement in the commission
of the crime for an accused to be guilty of aiding or abetting.

 

                   In
order for you to find the accused guilty on the basis of aiding or abetting, it
is not sufficient for the Crown to prove that his acts, in fact, had the effect
of aiding or abetting the commission of the crime; the Crown must also prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that he did the acts for the purpose, or with the
intention of aiding or abetting the commission of an offence.

 

                   Having set out the
law on these matters, the trial judge then reviewed the available verdicts and
crimes:

 

                   You
must give special consideration and render separate verdicts with respect to
each accused and each offence considered.  Each accused is entitled to have his
guilt, or innocence, as to each crime charged determined from his own conduct
and from the evidence which applies to him as if he were being tried alone.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   So,
you start at second degree murder with Jackson.  You make your determination. 
If you find Jackson not guilty of second degree murder, then you go down to
manslaughter.  He is only guilty of manslaughter.  That is conceded.  If you,
however, find that Jackson is guilty of second degree murder, then you go on to
consider whether or not it was a planned and deliberate, intentional killing;
and, if so, then he is guilty of first degree murder.

 

                   Likewise
with Davy.  Consider Davy as to second degree murder and his liability for
that.  If you are not satisfied as to that, you may consider manslaughter.  It
may be unlikely in this case that Davy would be guilty of manslaughter.  If you
find Davy guilty of second degree murder, only then do you step up and consider
his culpability as to first degree murder.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   As
far as Paul Benjamin Davy is concerned, you will be asked first; do you find
him guilty of first degree murder?  Although you start with second degree
murder in your deliberations.  If not, then, is he guilty of manslaughter?  If
not, then he is not guilty, and there is an outright acquittal.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   You
will be given various definitions of the Criminal Code .  You will get the
definition of second degree murder in s. 214  [now s. 231 ].  You will get the
definition of first degree murder in s. 214(2)  [now s. 231(2) ].  You will also
get simple manslaughter as a third alternative.  There is no definition of an
unlawful act causing death and it is already conceded that the assault would
cause death, therefore there is manslaughter in the least.  You will also be
given s. 21  in its entirety as to actual parties to the offence.  Remember,
each is liable if they are a party to the offence.  You can be a party by
actually committing, aiding, abetting, or by having an intention to rob where
it is probable that murder will result.

 

                   Finally, the trial
judge gave the jury this concluding instruction:

 

 

                   In
considering each accused's liability separately in each scenario, apply s. 21 
of the Criminal Code , i.e., the party to an offence provision.  Apply those
provisions, the party provisions, to second degree murder, then to first degree
murder, if applicable, then to manslaughter, if applicable.  Start with s.
21(1) (a), actually commits; then s. 21(1) (b), aids; then s. 21(1) (c), abets,
and finally s. 21(2)  to each accused in each scenario.  Obviously, certain
subsections in s. 21  may not apply to each accused in particular scenarios.

 

                   If
you follow this approach, I am sure you will arrive at true and just verdicts.

 

                   At no point did the
trial judge expressly tell the jury that it was open to it to find Jackson
guilty of murder and Davy guilty of manslaughter.  In the scenarios which he
outlined for the jury, none of the possible verdicts for Davy were
manslaughter.  Furthermore, and most telling, the trial judge stated: ""It
may be unlikely in this case that Davy would be guilty of manslaughter.""

 

                   The Crown argues
that the trial judge adequately set out the requirements of manslaughter and
left that verdict open with respect to both accused.  Furthermore, the Crown
stresses that the trial judge advised the jury to consider the position of each
accused independently.  Finally, the Crown notes that if the jury followed the
trial judge's directions, it would not have arrived at the verdict of
manslaughter unless it was satisfied that Davy was not guilty of murder.  This,
states the Crown,  was clearly not the case as the jury convicted him of second
degree murder.  The Crown says that it was unnecessary to expressly tell the
jury that they could convict Jackson of murder and Davy of manslaughter.

 

                   Giving these
arguments due weight, I am nevertheless left in doubt as to whether the jury
was properly charged with respect to manslaughter.  I agree with the Court of
Appeal that it was essential that the jury be instructed with respect to Davy's
potential liability for manslaughter under ss. 21(1)  and 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code .  It might not be apparent to a jury reading these provisions that,
under them, they could convict Jackson for murder and Davy for manslaughter. 
This was exacerbated by the trial judge's suggestion that it was unlikely that
Davy was guilty of manslaughter and by some of the wording employed by the
trial judge in the charge.  For example, the trial judge, in charging the jury
on parties to the offence, used the phrase, ""[a]ll parties to the offence
are equally guilty.""  If the jury had concluded that the offence under s.
21(2)  was murder by Jackson, this might well have led it to conclude that Davy
must also be guilty of murder when, as discussed above, he may have only been
guilty of manslaughter in the absence of the requisite intent  for murder. 
This ambiguity in the charge could have been easily countered by a clear
explanation that the jury might find Jackson guilty of murder and Davy guilty
of manslaughter.  That direction, however, was not given.

 

                   It is true that the
trial judge charged the jury clearly and correctly on the mental state required
to find Davy guilty of murder.  It is also true that the jury found Davy guilty
of murder.  Nevertheless, I agree with the Court of Appeal that one cannot be
satisfied the verdict is just, given the failure of the trial judge to set out
the basis for convicting Davy of manslaughter under ss. 21(1)  and 21(2)  and the
absence of any instruction that a party may be guilty of manslaughter even
though the perpetrator is guilty of murder.  As Lord Tucker stated in Bullard
v. The Queen, [1957] A.C. 635, at p. 644:

 

Every
man on trial for murder has the right to have the issue of manslaughter left to
the jury if there is any evidence upon which such a verdict can be given.  To
deprive him of this right must of necessity constitute a grave miscarriage of
justice and it is idle to speculate what verdict the jury would have reached.

 

                   I cannot but
conclude that Lord Tucker's admonition has not been followed in this case and
the issue of manslaughter was not properly left to the jury. 

 

(2) Whether Section 686(1)(b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code Applies

 

                   I am not satisfied
that it is clear that a jury, properly instructed, would necessarily have
returned a verdict of second degree murder against Davy.  He was entitled to
have the verdict of manslaughter clearly put to the jury.  We cannot be certain
that if this had been done, and notwithstanding the correct instruction on
murder, that the verdict might not have been different.  This is, consequently,
not a proper case for the application of s. 686(1)(b)(iii).

                   Appellant was
charged with second degree murder of a cab driver.  His great‑aunt, a
first nation band elder with little formal education, accompanied him on his
arrest to the police station.  Appellant regarded her as his mother.  The
police informed her that there would be time to look for a lawyer on their
arrival at the police station but, on their arrival, both were taken to an
interview room where the investigating constable began taking a statement over
the course of four and a half hours.  Prior to taking the statement, a
""Statement to Person in Authority Form"" required by s. 56  of the
Young Offenders Act (YOA) was completed.  The officer tried to
explain the right to counsel, the right to have an adult present, and the fact
that any statement could be used in proceedings against the accused.  A
statement was made without the advice of a lawyer.  Later, appellant, at his
request, met with his lawyer for a half hour.  The next day, appellant informed
the investigating constable that he had information to add to his statement. 
After appellant finished speaking with his lawyer, he and the constable went
through the process of completing the ""Statement to Person in
Authority"" form.  Appellant indicated that he did not want a lawyer or
other adult present.  The second statement included an exchange about the plan
the appellant and his co‑accuseds had to murder a cab driver.

 

                   The trial judge
excluded the first statement but admitted the second.  Appellant unsuccessfully
appealed his conviction.  He had sought to have the second statement excluded
and an acquittal on the basis that on the evidence absent the second statement
he ought to have been acquitted.

 

                   At issue here were
the principles ‑‑ under the common law, the Young Offenders Act
(YOA) and s. 10 (b) of the Charter  ‑‑ that
were applicable to determine the admissibility of a statement preceded by a
confession ruled inadmissible.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
allowed.

 

                   Although
only the admissibility of the second statement was in issue, its admissibility
was affected by the grounds for exclusion of the first statement.  The latter
was excluded as involuntary by the trial judge, a finding which was assumed to
be correct by the Court of Appeal.  It was necessary to consider its
admissibility by reasons of non-compliance with the YOA and the Charter 
as well. 

                   A parent is not an
alternative to counsel unless the right to counsel is waived.  Section 56  YOA,
which appears to provide that a parent or other adult may be an alternative to
counsel, must be interpreted in a manner consistent with both the s. 10 (b)
Charter  right to counsel and the provision in s. 11  YOA
requiring that counsel be available.

 

 

                   The determination
of whether or not a young person validly waived his or her s. 10 (b)
Charter  right to counsel is not to be based simply on what the police
told the young person, but upon the young person's actual awareness of the
consequences of his or her actions.  The police need not advise an accused as a
matter of course of the maximum penalty he or she might face.  The phenomenal
difference in potential consequences faced by the young person in youth court
as opposed to adult court, however, mandates that a young person be aware of
the possibility (where it exists) that he or she will be elevated to adult
court, and the potential result of this in terms of stigma and penalty.  The
particular characteristics of young offenders make extra precautions necessary
in affording them the full protection of their Charter  rights.

 

                   Because appellant
was neither advised of nor given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right
to counsel either under the Charter  or the YOA, the issue of
whether he validly waived that right did not arise.  With respect to the first
statement, neither appellant nor his great‑aunt appreciated the
consequences of his act of confession, despite the fact that appellant had had previous
dealings with the police.  If waiver had been in issue, appellant would not
have had sufficient information concerning the extent of his jeopardy to make
an informed and valid decision as to whether or not to speak with a lawyer. 
Accordingly, neither s. 56  YOA nor s. 10 (b) of the Charter 
were complied with and the first statement was inadmissible on this ground as
well.  

 

                   With respect to the
second statement, its admissibility was considered independently of the first
statement and in conjunction therewith.  The finding that appellant did not
waive his right to counsel with respect to the first statement because he was
not advised that he might be transferred to adult court had no application to
the second statement because the appellant exercised his right to counsel.  He
asserted, however, that advice concerning transfer was a pre-condition to
admissibility.  The strict requirements set out in s. 56 concerning the
admissibility of statements of a young person to a ""person in authority""
in proceedings against him or her recognize that young persons generally have a
lesser understanding of their legal rights than adults and are less likely to
assert and exercise those rights fully when confronted with an authority
figure.  In addition, ss. 56(1)  and 56(2) (a) YOA, read together,
incorporate the common law relating to the voluntariness of statements made by
accused persons, including any special requirements applicable in the case of
young persons.  An analysis of the common law with respect to advising a young
person over age 14 of the possibility of being tried in adult court
demonstrates that this was considered to be an important consideration in
determining voluntariness where the statement was tendered in adult court
following a successful transfer application

 

                   A warning that a
young person may be raised to adult court should not be interpreted as an
absolute requirement of s. 56 in all cases in which the young person is
over the age of 14.  Parliament has set out with great precision in s. 56(2) (b)
those procedures which it has determined must be complied with in every case in
order that a statement made by a young person to a person in authority be
admissible against the young person.  Those necessary procedures do not include
a warning as to the possibility of being raised to adult court.  The presence
or absence of such a warning is to be considered not as a specific requirement
of s. 56(2) (b) but as an aspect of determining whether or not,
apart from complying with s. 56(2) (b), the statement was
voluntary.  In these circumstances, the Court would be hesitant to find that
the statement was involuntary independently of the first statement.

 

                   The appellant's
second statement could be excluded on the grounds that it was involuntary, or
was obtained in breach of s. 10 (b) of the Charter  as well as
breach of the YOA, when considered in conjunction with the first
statement.

 

                   Under the rules
relating to confessions at common law, the admissibility of a confession which
had been preceded by an involuntary confession involved a factual
determination, based on factors designed to ascertain the degree of connection
between the two statements.  These included the time span between the
statements, advertence to the previous statement during questioning, the discovery
of additional incriminating evidence subsequent to the first statement, the
presence of the same police officers at both interrogations and other
similarities between the two circumstances.  A subsequent confession would be
involuntary if either the tainting features which disqualified the first
confession continued to be present or if the making of the first statement was
a substantial factor contributing to the making of the second statement.  An
explanation of one's rights either by a police officer or counsel may not avail
in the face of a strong urge to explain away incriminating matters in a prior
statement.  Unless counsel knows that the first statement will be inadmissible,
the best advice may not be to say nothing.  In most cases, it is unlikely that
counsel will be able to say with any assurance that the first statement will be
adjudged inadmissible.

 

                   Section 56 not
only incorporates the common law of voluntariness but also imposes statutory
requirements with respect to the right to consultation and the presence of
counsel or an adult.  The requirement that the explanation as to the accused's
rights precede the making of the statement is to ensure that the young person
does not relinquish the right to silence except in the exercise of free will in
the context of a full understanding and appreciation of his or her rights.  A
previous statement may operate to compel a further statement notwithstanding
explanations and advice belatedly proffered.  If, therefore, the successor
statement is simply a continuation of the first, or if the first statement is a
substantial factor contributing to the making of the second, the condition
envisaged by s. 56 has not been attained and the statement is
inadmissible.  The final basis for exclusion of the second statement is breach
of s. 10 (b) of the Charter .  If an inadmissible statement is
followed by a further statement which in and of itself involves no Charter 
breach, the admissibility of the latter will be resolved under s. 24(2)  of
the Charter .  The presence of a causative relationship is not a
requirement in order to trigger a s. 24  analysis.  

 

                   Here there was not
only a close temporal relationship between the statements, but also the second
statement was a continuation of the first, and the first statement was a
substantial factor leading to the making of the second.  The statements were
taken less than a day apart by the same officer.  There was no evidence that
the police in the interval between the two statements had gathered further
evidence tending to incriminate appellant to which appellant might be asked to
respond.  There was also continuous advertence by the police officer throughout
the second statement to information given in the first statement.  All of the
evidence leads to the conclusion that the second statement was a continuation
of the first.  Communication with counsel did not obviate this conclusion.

 

                          Given these
findings, the second statement was inadmissible both on the basis of the common
law test and the exclusionary language of s. 56.  It would also have been
inadmissible under s. 24(2)  of the Charter , had it been necessary to so
rule.  Appellant was accordingly acquitted.

                   Sopinka
J. -- This appeal
concerns the appropriate principles which are applicable to determine the
admissibility of a confession which is preceded by a confession that is ruled
inadmissible.  These principles will be examined in connection with three bases
on which the first confession may be inadmissible, namely, because:

 

                   (i)        it was
involuntary;

 

                   (ii)   it
was obtained without complying with the Young Offenders Act (""YOA"");

 

                   (iii)it
was obtained in breach of s. 10 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights

Facts

 

                   The appellant E.T.
was convicted in Youth Court of the second degree murder of a cab driver on
October 12, 1988.  E.T. was at the time a 16-year-old drop-out who lived with his
great-aunt, C.T., a 62-year-old Elder of the Tsawout Band with two years of
schooling.  Three other persons, two young offenders, A. and L.I.R., and an
adult of approximately 23 years, were also implicated in this murder.  The
adult, Michael Allen, was tried before a judge and jury and convicted of
manslaughter.  His trial and the appeals therefrom took place prior to
commencement of the trial of the young offenders and Allen gave evidence for
the Crown at the latter trial.  The three young offenders were charged with
first degree murder.  The Crown's theory was that the death of the cab driver
was the intended culmination of a plan to rob a taxi cab driver.  The trial
judge concluded on a no-evidence motion that with respect to all three accused
there was no evidence of first degree murder.  The Youth Court judge convicted
the appellant and A. of murder in the second degree and L.I.R. of
manslaughter.  

 

                   During the course
of the trial, the Crown sought to have admitted as evidence two statements made
by E.T. to the police after the killing.   The trial judge excluded a first
statement made the day of E.T.'s arrest, but admitted a second statement made
the next day.  The circumstances surrounding the making of the two statements
were as follows.  On the morning of October 12 (the murder of the cab driver
having taken place in the very early hours of that morning), the appellant was
arrested at his home, warned, and his clothes were seized.  He asked that his
great-aunt, C.T., whom he regarded as his mother, be allowed to come with him
and the two were taken to the RCMP station.  While en route to the station in
the police car, C.T. began searching in her purse for her lawyer's card, and
was advised by the police officers that ""all of that"" would be taken
care of at the police station.  When they arrived at the station, however, E.T.
and his aunt were taken directly to an interview room, and Constable Logan
commenced taking a statement from E.T. which lasted some four and a half
hours.  The statement was preceded by the following exchange which involved the
filling out of the Statement to Person in Authority form required by s. 56 of
the Young Offenders Act:

 

[Logan].
. . Now um, [E.], I'm gonna do, give you the ah, give you your choices of, of
giving a statement to a person in authority, you understand that I'm a person
in authority.  I've identified myself as Constable Matt LOGAN and um, given you
the, the same ah, type of thing at your home, but I'd like to give it to you
again and in front of both of you so you understand. . . . First of all um, I'm
explaining to you that you, that you're under no obligation to give a
statement.  

 

ET                      Yeah.

 

                   [Logan]That
any statements that I may give may be used as evidence in proceedings against
me.  I've been given an opportunity to speak to a lawyer or a parent or in the
absence of a parent, the adult relative or in the presence or the absence of a
parent or an adult relative, an adult of my own choosing.  And you're choice
that you gave me at the home would still stay the same that you wish to speak
to ah, to me in front of your, in front of your ah, grand-aunt, in front of
[C.T.], aye.  Ah, do you refer to [C.T.] as mom?

 

                   ET   Yeah. 


 

                                                                   .
. .

 

[Logan].
. . Okay now ah, out of those choices I wish to speak with one of my parents, I
wish to speak with an adult relative or an adult of my own choosing ah, you
would circle which one and I'll let you go ahead and do it.  

 

ET               Well
(undecipherable).

 

[Logan]Your
mom um, [C.T.] would be a, an adult of your ah, your choosing, yeah.

 

ET
(undecipherable).

 

                   [Logan].
. . Relative now, now here it says I have the right to give my statement in the
presence ah, of and you circle your choice.  You have the right to give in the
presence of a lawyer, of a parent or of an adult relative or an adult of your
own choosing.  And you just circle the person that you would like in the room
when you ah, when you give a statement.  

 

ET
I guess one of my parents?

 

[Logan]Um
. . . probably the presence of an adult relative would be the choice there. 
Um, [C.T] is like a parent but she um, we'd have to go with an adult relative. 
Okay.  Um ...

 

ET               Sign
right here?

 

[Logan]Okay,
right, I need your signature right there, yeah.  And I'll get [C.T.] to sign it
too.  Just figure out where she should sign it first.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   [C.T.
signs and Constable Logan signs.]

 

[Logan].
. . I think before we start off ah, you know I understand you're sixteen years
of age, you're ah, you know you're just starting out in life.

 

ET               Yeah.

 

[Logan]
And um, you know, you've got a long way, long life ahead of you, long ways to
go and ah, you'll make a lot of decisions in your life and today is one, is a
decision that you have to make on whether to ah, whether to tell us the truth
about what happened and ah . . . your truthfulness will make a lot of ah, make
a lot of things come clear and ah, it'll be a major, major thing in your, in
your life to, to do that.  So what I'd like to ask you ah, [E.], is that ah,
is, what you can relate to me about ah, an incident that happened early this
morning.  

 

ET               Yeah. 


 

                   After the statement
was completed, E.T. and C.T. were driven back to their home where E.T. produced
a knife and the keys to the driver's cab.  C.T. was told that she was through,
and that E.T. would remain in police custody.  Constable Logan then took E.T.
to visit the scene of the crime after which they returned to the police
station.  Following the appellant's request, he had an interview in person with
his lawyer which lasted half an hour.  The next morning, the appellant
telephoned Constable Logan and said he remembered some things he had forgotten
the day before and wished to add them to his statement.  When the Constable
arrived at the police station, he found the appellant engaged in a telephone
conversation with his lawyer which ended shortly thereafter.  When Logan sat
down with the appellant, they again went through the filling out of the
""Statement to Person in Authority"" form and E.T. indicated without
prompting that he did not wish to speak to anyone other than Constable Logan or
have anyone else present during his statement.  Constable Logan also explained
to E.T. that if anyone had offered him any hope of advantage or suggested any
fear of prejudice with respect to giving this statement, that E.T. should
forget about what they had said.  The second statement was taken over a
relatively short period, and after covering the topics which E.T. had
apparently mentioned over the phone, reverted to a discussion of what the
youths' plan with respect to the cab driver had been.  The second statement included
the following exchange: 

 

Q.               .
. . What was the complete plan?

 

A.[A.]
was gonna sit behind the driver and stab him in the neck. . . . I was supposed
to sit in the passenger side in the front and just stab when ah . . . [L.I.R.]
and [Allen] were to hold the guns to his head.  

 

The same statement also included the
following question and answer:

 

Q..
. . Was everyone aware and in agreement with the plan to kill the taxi driver?

 

A.[A.]
and [L.] were, Mike and I were I don't know, wondering I guess.

 

                   As mentioned above,
the trial judge excluded the first statement but admitted the second, and
convicted E.T. of second degree murder.  The appellant appealed his conviction
to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, seeking to have the second
statement excluded, and if successful, he claimed that he would be entitled to
an acquittal on the ground that the evidence established his innocence as a
principal, and that there was no evidence to support his conviction as an aider
or abettor under s. 21(1)(b) and (c) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  The Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissed the
appeal.

 

Judgments Below

 

Provincial Court (Metzger, Prov. Ct. J.)

 

                   Voir
Dire on Admissibility of Statements Made by Appellant

 

                   The trial judge
stated that the statements could only be admitted into evidence if they were
voluntary and that voluntariness includes the accused's appreciating the
consequences of giving the statement.  With young offenders, ss. 11 and 56 YOA
must also be complied with.  The trial judge stated that the reason that a
young person is entitled to have an adult with him is that ""[t]he young
offender needs someone who appreciates what is happening to be there with him
to give him advice because the law treats him differently from adult
persons"".  The trial judge found as a fact that C.T. did not understand
that E.T. could face life imprisonment, that E.T. did not have to talk to the
police, or that she could have stopped the questioning at any time.  While stating
that Constable Logan behaved in a forthright and proper manner throughout, the
trial judge held that the additional steps, which should have been taken in
this case given the lack of sophistication of E.T. and C.T., would have been to
say something like the following: 

 

 

`C.T.',
`E.' could go to prison for life if he confesses to me.  Do you understand that
he can be convicted of murder in adult court if he was in the taxi and even if
he did not even touch the taxi driver?  `C.T.', I urge you to talk to a
lawyer.  Now, do you appreciate what may happen to `E.T.'?  Do you still want
to talk to me?

 

                   The trial judge
held that although E.T. was given his Charter  and YOA rights,
there were no threats or promises made to him, he had had previous dealings
with the police, and this was a first degree murder case, the first statement
made by E.T. should be excluded as he did not appreciate the consequences of
his act of confession when he made this statement to the police.  The trial
judge concluded, however, that the second statement made by E.T. ""is
admissible as the defect of not appreciating the consequences of his acts was
cured by his consultation with a lawyer before he gave that statement"".

 

                   Judgment
on Conviction

 

                   The
entirety of Metzger Prov. Ct. J.'s judgment on conviction reads as follows:

 

I
have considered all of the evidence properly before me along with the arguments
of counsel and including the consumption of alcohol and the aspect of intent,
and I make the following findings if each of you would stand, please,
gentlemen:

 

                   You,
[E.T.], I find guilty of second degree murder; [A.], I find you guilty of
second degree murder; and, [L.], guilty of manslaughter. 

 

Court of Appeal, R. v. L.R.I. and E.T. (1991),
8 B.C.A.C. 199 (Toy, Proudfoot and Goldie JJ.A.) 

 

                   Goldie J.A.
accepted the Crown's concession that the trial judge was correct to exclude the
first statement, but commented that this did not mean he agreed with the trial
judge's reasons for doing so.  With regard to the trial judge's finding that
the constable should have explained to E.T. the possibility of life
imprisonment if he were raised to adult court, Goldie J.A. was of the view, at
p. 207, that:

 

                   Requiring
a police officer to explain the potential consequences of the charge facing a
young offender may very well cause a number of difficult problems.  The
potential disadvantages are not confined to the additional burden it places on
the police officer.

 

                   Goldie J.A.
concluded that the trial judge was correct to admit the second statement
because E.T. had spoken to a lawyer prior to making it.  He stated that
although the trial judge could not guess what advice E.T. received from his
lawyer, it offended common sense to assume that E.T. did not tell his lawyer of
his choice to talk to Constable Logan again, and that it would be destructive
of solicitor-client relationships if the trial judge accepted that E.T. had not
discussed his decision with his lawyer. 

 

                   Goldie J.A. added
that when the case against the appellant was examined in light of the second
statement, the basis for a conviction of second degree murder becomes clear. He
added at p. 208:

 

                   Allen's
evidence confined the stabbing to A.  Unlike L.R.I., however, there were blood
stains on E.T.'s clothes which might have been taken by the trier of fact to
confirm the thrust of E.T.'s statement.  In short, the trier of fact could have
concluded that E.T. and A. shared an intention which culminated in the death of
the cab driver who responded to the call made at 5:35 a.m. and that E.T. either
actively participated or aided and abetted A. in the execution of that
intention. 

 

                   Toy
J.A. (Concurring reasons)

 

                   In
concurring with the reasons of Goldie J.A., Toy J.A. commented on the need for
more adequate reasons for the convictions by the Youth Court judge in the
circumstances of this case. 

 

The Issues

 

                   It should be noted
that it is only the second of the two statements given by E.T. to the police
which is at issue on this appeal.  The first statement was excluded by the
trial judge because he was of the view neither E.T. nor his great-aunt, C.T.,
understood the consequences of E.T.'s confession to the police or the full
extent of the jeopardy in which he found himself.  The Court of Appeal assumed
that the first statement had been properly excluded (and indeed the Crown did
not dispute its exclusion on appeal) but Goldie J.A. made it clear that this
assumption did not mean that he agreed with the trial judge's reasons for
excluding the statement.  The Crown likewise did not seek to reopen the
analysis of the first statement in this Court.  As did the Court of Appeal, I
am prepared to assume the correctness of the finding of the trial judge that
the first statement was inadmissible because it was involuntary.  In view of
the fact that the admissibility of the second statement depends on the reasons
for the inadmissibility of the first statement, I will consider whether it was
inadmissible, as well, by reason of non-compliance with the Charter  and
the YOA.  I will then deal with the admissibility of the second
statement. 

 

Requirements of the
Charter  and the Young Offenders Act

 

                   Section 10 (b)
of the Charter  provides that ""[e]veryone has the right on arrest or
detention . . . (b) to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to
be informed of that right"".  Likewise, s. 11 YOA requires that all
young persons arrested or detained under the Act have ""the right to retain
and instruct counsel without delay at any stage of proceedings against
[them]"" and that they shall be advised of this right ""forthwith on
[their] arrest or detention"" and ""be given an opportunity to obtain
counsel"".  Section 56 then imposes further obligations upon the police in
respect of taking statements from young persons, including the obligation to
allow the young person to consult with a parent, adult relative or other adult
or a lawyer and to have that person present when making the statement.  Section
56 provides explicitly that if its requirements are not complied with, then the
statement is inadmissible.  

 

                   In this case, the
officer purported to comply with the Charter  and the YOA by
advising the appellant that he had the right to a reasonable opportunity to
speak to either a lawyer or a parent or, in the absence of a parent, another
adult of his choosing.  The trial judge accepted this as a compliance with both
the Charter  and the YOA.  I disagree.  While s. 56 appears to
provide that a parent or other adult is an alternative to counsel, s. 11 does
not.  How is this apparent conflict resolved?  In my view, s. 56 cannot be
interpreted in a manner that derogates from the mandatory requirement in s.
11.  If so interpreted, s. 56 would purport to reduce the constitutional right
of an accused young person under s. 10 (b) of the Charter . 
This it cannot do and s. 56 should therefore be interpreted in a manner that is
consistent with s. 10 (b) of the Charter  and with s. 11 YOA. 
The only interpretation of s. 56 which is consistent with both s. 10 (b)
of the Charter  and s. 11 YOA is that a parent is not an
alternative to counsel unless the right to counsel is waived.

 

                   E.T. was not
advised of his independent right to counsel and therefore it cannot be said
that he waived the right.  In any event, apart from this omission, it is my
view that that waiver would not have been valid in the circumstances of this
case.  In this regard, I accept the submission of counsel for the appellant
that if waiver is to be relied upon in these circumstances, the young person
cannot be presumed to know the extent of his or her jeopardy and must be
advised that an application may be made to have the case tried in adult court
under s. 16 YOA and that the result of such an application is that the
appellant would face up to life imprisonment rather than the three-year maximum
under the YOA.  Such an application was, in fact, made here and was
successful at first instance but reversed on appeal.

 

                   The right of the
accused to know the extent of his or her jeopardy in the context of the s. 10 (b)
right to counsel was discussed by this Court in R. v. Smith, [1991] 1
S.C.R. 714, a case in which the police had failed to advise the accused that
his shooting victim had died.  McLachlin J., for the Court, summarized the law
in this area as follows, at pp. 726-27:

 

                   In
Canada, we have adopted a different approach [than that in the United States]. 
We take the view that the accused's understanding of his situation is relevant
to whether he has made a valid and informed waiver.  This approach is mandated
by s. 10 (a) of the Charter , which gives the detainee the right to
be promptly advised of the reasons for his or her detention.  It is exemplified
by three related concepts:  (1) the ""tainting"" of a warning as to the
right to counsel by lack of information; (2) the idea that one is entitled to
know ""the extent of one's jeopardy""; and (3) the concept of
""awareness of the consequences"" developed in the context of waiver.  

 

McLachlin J. went on to conclude that
in the circumstances of the case, the accused must have been aware that he had
been involved in a most serious crime and, particularly, that his victim had
likely died.  Thus, he was possessed of sufficient information as to make a
valid decision whether or not to exercise his right to counsel.  

 

                   Applying these
principles to the young offender context, it seems to me that the phenomenal
difference in potential consequences faced by the young person in youth court
as opposed to adult court mandates that a young person be aware of the
possibility (where it exists) that he or she will be elevated to adult court,
and the potential result of this in terms of stigma and penalty.  In the
present case, this means that E.T. should have been advised that the Crown
might apply to have E.T. tried in adult court and that the maximum penalty
which he might face, given that a death was involved, is life imprisonment
without parole for 25 years.  As McLachlin J. noted in Smith, however,
the determination of whether or not a young person validly waived his or her s.
10 (b) right to counsel is not to be based simply on what the police told
the young person, but upon the young person's actual awareness of the
consequences of his or her actions.  In the present case, the trial judge
concluded after hearing the testimony that, with respect to the first
statement, neither E.T. nor his great-aunt appreciated the consequences of his
act of confession, despite the fact that E.T. had had previous dealings with
the police.  

 

                   This is not to say
that in the normal course, it is necessary that the police advise an accused of
the maximum penalty he or she might face.   In my view the particular
characteristics of young offenders make extra precautions necessary in
affording them the full protection of their Charter  rights. 

 

                   With respect to the
first statement, of course, I have already said that E.T. was neither advised
of nor given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel either
under the Charter  or the YOA, and thus the issue of whether he
validly waived that right does not arise.  If waiver were in issue, however, I
would have found that E.T. did not have sufficient information concerning the
extent of his jeopardy to make an informed and valid decision as to whether or
not to speak with a lawyer.  Accordingly, s. 56 was not complied with and the
first statement was inadmissible.  It follows from what I have said that there
was a failure to comply with s. 10 (b) of the Charter  in addition
to non-compliance with s. 56 YOA.  The result of the total failure to
comply with s. 10 (b) was that a confession was obtained from a young
person who was conscripted against himself.  Admission of the statement would
have affected the fairness of the trial and its rejection was mandated on any
view of the Collins factors (R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R.
265).  

 

                   This takes me to
the admissibility of the second statement.  I will address this question from
two aspects:

 

(1)Was
it admissible when considered independently of the first statement and the
circumstances surrounding it? 

 

(2)Was
it admissible when considered in conjunction with the first statement?

 

The Second Statement

 

                   (1)  Admissibility
Independent of First Statement

 

                   Prior to the making
of the second statement, E.T. had had a half-hour interview in person with his
lawyer and also spoke with his lawyer on the telephone immediately before
making the second statement.  He had therefore exercised his right to counsel,
and the provisions of s. 56 as interpreted above were complied with.  My
finding that E.T. did not waive his right to counsel with respect to the first
statement because he was not advised that he might be transferred to adult
court has no application to the second statement.  But counsel for the
appellant forcefully contended that apart from its role with respect to waiver,
discussed above, the obligation under s. 56 to advise a young person of the
possibility of being raised to adult court is a pre-condition of
admissibility.  If this is so and a young person must be expressly
advised of this possibility by the police, whether or not the young person has
had the advice of counsel, then the second statement should also have been
excluded.  This raises the question as to whether s. 56, either by its express
language or by implication in incorporating the common law doctrine of
voluntariness, makes it mandatory that a young person be advised that he or she
may be transferred to adult court prior to the taking of a statement.  If so,
then clearly this obligation was not met in this case, and it would be
necessary to consider whether this deficiency was rectified by E.T.'s
consultation with counsel prior to making the second statement.

 

                   Section 56 sets out
strict requirements which must be complied with in order to render a statement
made by a young person to a ""person in authority"" admissible in
proceedings against him or her.  The rationale for this lies in Parliament's
recognition that young persons generally have a lesser understanding of their
legal rights than do adults and are less likely to assert and exercise fully
those rights when confronted with an authority figure.  The requirements in s.
56(2) (b) reflect this concern;  a young person is given the right to
consult with a parent or other adult as well as the right to counsel upon
arrest or detention, and is entitled to have a lawyer or a parent or other
adult present when making a statement.  The young person must also be
specifically told prior to the taking of any statement, in language appropriate
to his or her level of understanding, that he or she is under no obligation to
make a statement and that anything said may be used as evidence in proceedings
against him or her.  

 

                   There is no express
requirement in s. 56(2) (b) that a young person over the age of 14 be
warned of the possibility of being raised to adult court.  The initial
inference to be drawn from this omission is that Parliament did not feel that
such a warning should be an absolute requirement in every case.  However, there
are a number of ways in which this requirement may be seen to have been
incorporated into s. 56.  First, the requirement in s. 56(2) (b)(ii) that
the young person be advised that ""any statement given by him may be used
as evidence in proceedings against him"" could be seen to require by
inference that the young person be told what the ""proceedings against
him"" may consist of, at least where there may be special proceedings such
as a trial in adult court.  Such an interpretation would somewhat strain the
wording of s. 56(2) (b)(ii), however, since the purpose of this part of
the caution, in conjunction with that in s. 56(2) (b)(i), appears to be
simply to advise of the right to silence and that any statements made may be
used against the young person.

 

                   More importantly,
s. 56(2) (a) provides that, along with the requirement of the specific
procedures in s. 56(2) (b), the statement must be voluntary.  Further, s.
56(1) provides that subject to the specific requirements of the rest of the
section, the law relating to the admissibility of statements made by persons
accused of committing offences applies in respect of young persons.  The effect
of these two subsections is clearly to incorporate the common law relating to
the voluntariness of statements made by accused persons, including any special
requirements applicable in the case of young persons.  An analysis of the
common law with respect to advising a young person over age 14 of the
possibility of being tried in adult court demonstrates that this was considered
to be an important consideration in determining voluntariness where the
statement was tendered in adult court following a successful transfer
application (R. v. Yensen (1961), 130 C.C.C. 353 (Ont. H.C.)).  In Yensen,
McRuer C.J.H.C. stated at p. 358 that while he did not have to decide the case
on this ground (the young person not having been properly warned as to his
right to remain silent), he had ""very grave doubts"" as to the right
to use the statement of a juvenile in adult court ""unless great care is
taken to give a full explanation to the accused that that is the course that
events might take.""  Likewise, in cases where, as here, the statement was
only offered as evidence in youth court, the absence of such a warning was held
to be an important factor in determining whether or not the statements were
voluntary (R. v. D.M. and J.P. (1980), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 373 (Ont. Prov.
Ct.); R. v. A. (1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 537 (Alta. S.C.T.D.)).  It is
important to note, however, that in none of the above cases was it held to be a
hard and fast rule in all cases that a young person over 14 years of age be
warned that they could be raised to adult court.  Rather, the presence or
absence of such a warning was one factor to be considered in determining
whether the statement was voluntary.

 

                   In my view, though,
a warning that a young person may be raised to adult court should not be
interpreted as an absolute requirement of s. 56 in all cases in which the young
person is over the age of 14.  Parliament has set out with great precision in
s. 56(2) (b) those procedures which it has determined must be
complied with in every case in order that a statement made by a young person to
a person in authority be admissible against the young person.  Those necessary
procedures do not include a warning as to the possibility of being raised to
adult court.  In my view, therefore, the presence or absence of such a warning
is to be considered not as a specific requirement of s. 56(2) (b) but as
an aspect of determining whether or not, apart from complying with s. 56(2) (b),
the statement was voluntary.  

 

                   I have already
stated that a valid waiver of the right to counsel in s. 10 (b) or
s. 56 can only be made where a young person is aware of the consequences of his
or her actions, including the possibility of being raised to adult court. 
Here, E.T. exercised his right to counsel and s. 56(2) (b) was complied
with prior to the making of the second statement.  Was the statement
nonetheless involuntary because E.T. was not explicitly warned by the police
that he could be raised to adult court?  To answer this question, I must apply
the common law approach to date pursuant to which the presence or absence of
this warning is one factor to be considered in determining voluntariness, the
importance of which will vary depending upon the other facts of the case,
including the age, level of understanding and sophistication of the young
person and whether or not the young person has consulted with counsel.  While
it would have been preferable had the police given him this warning, E.T. did
exercise his right to counsel prior to making the second statement -- he spent
a half-hour with counsel the evening before and spoke with counsel on the phone
immediately prior to making the statement.  Although the Court should not
speculate upon what advice the lawyer gave E.T. with regard to what his
subsequent actions should be, we can presume, in the absence of any suggestion
to the contrary, that counsel was competent and was aware of and imparted to
E.T. the basic information about his rights, including the possibility of a
transfer application being made.  It appears that it was on this basis that the
trial judge concluded that the statement was voluntary.  In the circumstances
of this case, I would hesitate to hold that the statement was involuntary
simply because of the absence of an express police warning that E.T. might be
raised to adult court.  

 

                   (2)  Admissibility: 
Considered in Conjunction with First Statement.

 

                   The principles that
govern the admissibility of the second statement when considered in conjunction
with the first statement are directly influenced by the grounds for the
exclusion of the first statement.  As I have already stated I will assume the
correctness of the finding of the trial judge that the first statement was not
voluntary.  This issue was not contested by the Crown.  In addition, I have
found that it was inadmissible by reason of the breach of s. 10 (b)
of the Charter  as well as breach of the statutory right to counsel and
the right to be advised thereof under the YOA.  Section 56 both
incorporates the common law of voluntariness and adds statutory grounds for
exclusion.  Each of these constitutes a possible basis for exclusion of the
second statement.  With respect to the breach of the  Charter ,
s. 24(2)  provides its own formula for exclusion.  I propose to consider
the principles that bear on the admissibility of the second statement on each
of these bases.

 

                   Under the rules
relating to confessions at common law, the admissibility of a confession which
had been preceded by an involuntary confession involved a factual determination
based on factors designed to ascertain the degree of connection between the two
statements.  These included the time span between the statements, advertence to
the previous statement during questioning, the discovery of additional
incriminating evidence subsequent to the first statement, the presence of the
same police officers at both interrogations and other similarities between the
two circumstances.  See Boudreau v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 262; Horvath
v. The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R 376; and Hobbins v. The Queen, [1982] 1
S.C.R. 553.  No general rule excluded subsequent statements on the ground that
they were tainted irrespective of the degree of connection to the initial
admissible statement.  In this regard I adopt the language of Laskin C.J. in Hobbins,
supra, at p. 558, when he states:

 

                   There
can be no hard and fast rule that merely because a prior statement is ruled
inadmissible a second statement taken by the same interrogating officers must
be equally vulnerable.  Factual considerations must govern, including
similarity of circumstances and of police conduct and the lapse of time between
the obtaining of the two statements.

 

                   In applying these
factors, a subsequent confession would be involuntary if either the tainting
features which disqualified the first confession continued to be present or if
the fact that the first statement was made was a substantial factor
contributing to the making of the second statement.  In Cross on Evidence
(7th ed. 1990), the learned author summarizes the common law on this point and
contrasts it with the provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984, 1984 (U.K.), c. 60, which was enacted in England and now governs the
admissibility of confessions.  At page 619, he states:  

 

                   It
had become well-established in the old law that a confession which, considered
in isolation, appeared to satisfy the conditions for being voluntary, might
nevertheless be excluded if preceded by an earlier involuntary confession.  It
would be so excluded if either the factors tainting the earlier confession
continued to apply, or if the fact of having made such a confession could
itself be regarded as precipitating its successor.  There is nothing in the new
Act to displace so sensible an approach.

 

                   In these cases the
fact that a caution or warning had been given or that the advice of counsel had
been obtained between the two statements was a factor to be considered but it
was by no means determinative.  While such an occurrence went a long way to
dissipate elements of compulsion or inducement resulting from the conduct of the
interrogators, it might have little or no effect in circumstances in which the
second statement is induced by the fact of the first.  This point was made by
Estey J. in Boudreau, supra, at p. 285, where he states: 

 

A
warning under such circumstances, when already he had given information in
reply to questions and when immediately after the warning he is further
questioned by the same parties in a manner that directed his mind to the
information already given, is quite different in its effect from a warning
given before any questions are asked.

 

                   An explanation of
one's rights either by a police officer or counsel may not avail in the face of
a strong urge to explain away incriminating matters in a prior statement. 
Moreover, unless counsel knows that the first statement will be inadmissible,
the best advice may not be to say nothing.  In most cases, it is unlikely that
counsel will be able to say with any assurance that the first statement will be
adjudged inadmissible.

 

                   In view of the fact
that s. 56 incorporates the common law of voluntariness, these principles apply
to resolve the issue as to the admissibility of a confession which is made
after a prior involuntary confession.  But section 56 does more than
incorporate the common law.  It imposes additional statutory requirements with
respect to the right to consultation and the presence of counsel or an adult,
to which I have referred above.  There is no requirement that failure  to
comply with these provisions has any causative relationship to the making of
the statement.  The only relationship prescribed is a temporal one.  Unless the
requisite explanations are made before the statement is taken from the young
person, it is inadmissible.  This responds to the declaration in s. 3 YOA
that young persons ""have special guarantees of their rights and
freedoms"" (3(e)) and have the right ""to be informed as to what
those rights and freedoms are"" (3(g)).  

 

                   In order to
determine what principles should govern the admissibility of successive
statements in which there is a failure to comply followed by an attempt to
comply, it is necessary to interpret s. 56 and to decide what Parliament
intended when it states that ""[n]o oral or written statement . . . is
admissible against the young person unless . . . the person to whom the
statement was given has, before the statement was made, clearly explained . .
."" the rights to counsel, etc.  In arriving at the appropriate
interpretation, by virtue of s. 3(2) of the Act is to be ""liberally
construed to the end that young persons will be dealt with in accordance with
the principles set out in subsection (1)"" which include the principles to
which I have specifically referred above.

 

                   In my opinion, the
purpose of the requirement that the explanation prescribed by s. 56 precede the
making of the statement is to ensure that the young person does not relinquish
the right to silence except in the exercise of free will in the context of a
full understanding and appreciation of his or her rights.  A previous statement
may operate to compel a further statement notwithstanding explanations and
advice belatedly proffered.  If, therefore, the successor statement is simply a
continuation of the first, or if the first statement is a substantial factor
contributing to the making of the second, the condition envisaged by s. 56 has
not been attained and the statement is inadmissible.

 

                   The final basis for
exclusion of the second statement is breach of s. 10 (b) of the Charter . 
If a statement is followed by a further statement which in and of itself
involves no Charter  breach, its admissibility will be resolved under s.
24(2)  of the Charter .  This provides that evidence ""obtained in a
manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed"" by the Charter 
is inadmissible if its admission would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.  This language has been interpreted to apply irrespective of any
causal relationship between the breach and the obtaining of the evidence
provided that there is a sufficient temporal relationship between the evidence
and the breach.  Initial expression to this interpretation was given in R.
v. Therens, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 613.  At page 649, Le Dain J. (dissenting on
another point) stated: 

 

It
is not necessary to establish that the evidence would not have been obtained
out [sic] for the violation of the Charter .  Such a view gives
adequate recognition to the intrinsic harm that is caused by a violation of a Charter 
right or freedom, apart from its bearing on the obtaining of evidence.  I
recognize, however, that in the case of derivative evidence, which is not what
is in issue here, some consideration may have to be given in particular cases
to the question of relative remoteness.

 

                   Later, in R. v.
Strachan, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 980, a majority of this Court, per Dickson
C.J., endorsed the approach of Le Dain J. in Therens with respect to the
necessary connection to operationalize s. 24(2) , stating the following in that
regard, at pp. 1001-2:

 

                   In
the present appeal, Esson J.A. rejected the Crown's submission that s. 24(2) 
requires a causal link between the Charter  infringement and the
discovery of the evidence.  He considered R. v. Therens and held that it
did not stand for the proposition that s. 24(2)  requires a causal nexus.  In
his view the language of s. 24(2)  militated against such an interpretation.  If
present, a causal link was one factor to take into account in the later s.
24(2)  determination whether the admission of the evidence would bring the administration
of justice into disrepute. . . .

 

                   I
am inclined to agree with Esson J.A. and to reject the approach to the first
requirement of s. 24(2)  advanced by the Crown.  In my view, reading the phrase
""obtained in a manner"" as imposing a causation requirement creates a
host of difficulties.  A strict causal nexus would place the courts in the
position of having to speculate whether the evidence would have been discovered
had the Charter  violation not occurred.  Speculation on what might have
happened is a highly artificial task.  Isolating the events that caused the
evidence to be discovered from those that did not is an exercise in sophistry. 
Events are complex and dynamic.  It will never be possible to state with
certainty what would have taken place had a Charter  violation not
occurred. Speculation of this sort is not, in my view, an appropriate inquiry
for the courts.

 

                   A
causation requirement also leads to a narrow view of the relationship between a
Charter  violation and the discovery of evidence.  Requiring a causal
link will tend to distort the analysis of the conduct that led to the discovery
of evidence.  The inquiry will tend to focus narrowly on the actions most
directly responsible for the discovery of evidence rather than on the entire
course of events leading to its discovery.  This will almost inevitably lead to
an intellectual endeavour essentially amounting to ""splitting hairs""
between conduct that violated the Charter  and that which did not.

 

                   Recently, this
interpretation was applied to subject to a s. 24 analysis the results of a
search effected by means of a valid search warrant which had been preceded by a
search held to be unlawful by reason of a breach of s. 8  of the Charter . 
See R. v. Grant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 223.  Accordingly, while the presence
of a causative relationship may be relevant, particularly on the issue of
remoteness referred to by Le Dain J. and on the question of whether admission
would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, it is not a
requirement in order to trigger a s. 24  analysis.

 

Application to this
Case

 

                   I have concluded
that applying any of the above bases, the second statement must be excluded. 
Not only was there a close temporal relationship between the statements, but
the second statement was a continuation of the first, and the first statement
was a substantial factor leading to the making of the second.  The statements
were taken less than a day apart by the same officer.  There is no evidence
that the police in the interval between the two statements had gathered further
evidence tending to incriminate E.T. to which E.T. might be asked to respond. 
There was also continuous advertence by the police officer throughout the
second statement to information given in the first statement.  For example, after
E.T. had said what he wished to say regarding the blood on his clothing,
Constable Logan told him to think back to the plan and proceeded to ask him
further details about it.  In essence, E.T., having started a statement, asked
to complete it and did.

 

                   All of the evidence
in this case leads to the conclusion that the second statement was causally
connected to the first.  In Constable Logan's own words, E.T. wished to add
something to his statement of the day before.  The fact that E.T. consulted
with counsel between the making of the two statements and immediately prior to
making the second does not obviate this conclusion.  Both E.T. and Constable
Logan were operating from the perspective that the facts were already largely
on the table, and the relative lengths of the statements reflect this view --
the first lasted some five hours, the second only half an hour.  Secondly, no
one, including E.T.'s lawyer, would have known at that point that the first
statement would be held to be inadmissible at trial as Constable Logan had
advised E.T. according to the requirements of s. 56 as he understood them to
be.  While it is beyond this Court to speculate as to what E.T.'s lawyer told
him, I do not think we can infer that the lawyer would have advised E.T. that
the first statement was inadmissible such that E.T. should refrain from
corroborating incriminating statements already made.  Further, while we cannot
determine with any assurance what E.T.'s motivation for making the second
statement was, the largely exculpatory nature of the statement and the fact
that E.T. told Constable Logan that he wanted to explain why he might have had
blood on his pants suggests that E.T. wanted to give credence to his avowals in
the first statement that he was merely a bystander to the murder.  In the end,
then, as the appellant put it, ""[o]nce the first statement was given, the
rationale for further restraint in self-incrimination was gone"".  In
short, in these circumstances, communication with counsel cannot be said to
have the determinative effect that it would have had if it had taken place
before the first statement.

 

                   In view of the
finding that the existence of the first statement was a substantial factor in
inducing the making of the second statement, the latter is inadmissible both on
the basis of the common law test and the exclusionary language of s. 56. 
Moreover, had it been necessary, I would have also excluded it under
s. 24(2) .

 

                   Having concluded
that the trial judge erred in not excluding the second statement made by E.T.
as well as the first, I need not deal with the final ground of appeal -- that
is, whether even with the second statement there was sufficient evidence upon
which to base a conviction for second degree murder.  It remains only to
determine the appropriate remedy.  In their written submissions, counsel for
the appellant asked that an acquittal be entered, while the Crown asked only
that the appeal be dismissed.  The usual remedy in a case such as this would be
to order a new trial, likely on the charge of manslaughter given the finding of
the Court of Appeal, with which I agree, that the trial judge's conviction for
second degree murder rested on the second statement made by E.T.  When asked in
oral argument before this Court whether he would care to amend his Prayer for
Relief to seek an order for a new trial in the event this Court determined that
the second statement should have been excluded, Crown counsel initially
responded affirmatively.  However, Crown counsel then conceded in the face of
vehement opposition from counsel for the appellant that such an amendment would
not be fair as the Crown had never suggested that it might seek a manslaughter
conviction in E.T.'s case.  Notwithstanding, that even in these circumstances
the Court retains a discretion to order a new trial on manslaughter, in light
of the foregoing  and bearing in mind that E.T. has already served his term of
detention for the second degree murder conviction, an acquittal will be
ordered.

                   The accused,
through his company, supplied goods and services to H.B. Co., which paid for
them by sending the company a cheque.  A month later, owing to an error by H.B.
Co., a second cheque was issued to the accused's company. Like the first one,
the second cheque was deposited by the accused in his company's account. The
accused then appropriated the money by writing company cheques in his own
favour, reducing the balance of the account to practically nil. Despite leaving
repeated messages, a security officer for the H.B. Co. was unable to contact
the accused concerning the mistaken payment. The accused was later charged with
theft under s. 322(1)  of the Criminal Code  and convicted. A
majority of the Court of Appeal set aside the conviction. This appeal is to
determine whether, in some circumstances, a transferee may commit theft in
respect of property for which the transferor has a right of recovery because of
a mistake known to the transferee.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Where a transferor
mistakenly transfers property to a recipient, and the recipient knows of the
mistake, property does not pass for the purpose of the criminal law if under
the law of property the original transfer is void or voidable and the
transferor has a right of recovery. The distinction between void and voidable
transfers has no purpose in the context of the criminal law.  In either case,
where the law of property provides at least a right of recovery, property does
not pass for the purpose of the criminal law. If the recipient then converts
the property to his own use, fraudulently and without colour of right, and with
intent to deprive the transferor of the property, he is guilty of theft.

 

                   In the present
case, the conviction should be restored. The trial judge found that the accused
was aware that the second cheque had been issued to his company by mistake.
Therefore, property in the cheque did not pass to his company for the purpose
of the criminal law. The trial judge also found that the accused's actions in
depositing the second cheque in his company's account and then withdrawing the
money amounted to converting that money to his own use with intent to deprive
the H.B. Co. of its property.  This conversion was done fraudulently and
without colour of right, since the accused was aware that the cheque had been
issued by mistake.

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

 

                   Gonthier J. -- This case concerns the
application of the principles of the law of property to the law of theft,
specifically, whether in some circumstances a transferee may commit theft in
respect of property for which the transferor has a right of recovery because of
a mistake known to the transferee.

 

I -- Facts and Procedural History

 

                   Mr. Milne,
through his company National Electronics Security Inc., supplied goods and
services to the Hudson's Bay Co.  An account for $16,981 was paid by the
Hudson's Bay Co., by sending the company a cheque in that amount which
Mr. Milne deposited into his company's account.  A month later, due to an
error by the Hudson's Bay Co., a second cheque for $16,981 was received and
deposited by Mr. Milne into his company's account.  Mr. Milne then
appropriated the money by writing company cheques in his own favour.  These
cheques were certified by Mr. Milne, and reduced the balance of his
company's account to practically nil.  Mr. Milne had sole signing
authority for the company account.  A security officer for the Hudson's Bay Co.
was unable to contact Mr. Milne concerning the mistaken payment, despite
leaving repeated messages.

 

                   The question of
whether a theft occurred in this case is governed by s. 322(1)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , which states:

 

                   322. (1)  Every one commits theft who
fraudulently and without colour of right takes, or fraudulently and without
colour of right converts to his use or to the use of another person, anything,
whether animate or inanimate, with intent,

 

(a)
to deprive, temporarily or absolutely, the owner of it, or a person who has a
special property or interest in it, of the thing or of his property or interest
in it;

 

(b)
to pledge it or deposit it as security;

 

(c)
to part with it under a condition with respect to its return that the person
who parts with it may be unable to perform; or

 

(d)
to deal with it in such a manner that it cannot be restored in the condition in
which it was at the time it was taken or converted.

 

                   The trial judge
concluded that Mr. Milne knew that the second cheque had been issued to
his company by mistake, and given this knowledge, his actions in depositing it
and then withdrawing the money constituted a conversion.

 

                   It
seems to me that the only inference to be drawn from these circumstances is
that [Mr. Milne] knew that the money received by the issuing of the second
cheque had been paid in error, and that the funds should not have been
deposited to this account.  In my view the actions of [Mr. Milne] who had
knowledge of these circumstances in writing cheques on the numbered account
which contained funds that should not have been in that account constituted
theft.

 

                   Further, he held
that Mr. Milne had performed this conversion fraudulently, and without
colour of right, with the result that he was guilty of theft.

 

                   This decision was
overturned by a majority of the Court of Appeal:  (1990), 77 Alta. L.R. (2d) 1,
109 A.R. 268, 59 C.C.C. (3d) 372, [1991] 1 W.W.R. 385 (hereinafter cited to Alta.
L.R.).  Côté J.A. observed that whatever the intent of Mr. Milne, he
could not commit theft if the Hudson's Bay Co. did not retain a property
interest in the money it mistakenly paid to Mr. Milne's company.  He then
examined the law of property with respect to payment under mistake and noted
that in some cases such a payment transfers property, while in others it does
not.  After analyzing the cases, Côté J.A. came to the view that whether
property passes despite mistake depends on the kind of mistake which has been
made.  If the mistake has to do with the object of the transfer, or its
recipient, then property does not pass.  However, if the transferor gives the
intended object to the intended recipient, property does pass, even if the
intention itself was based on a mistake (at p. 20):

 

Property
passes if, and only if, the transferor gives the very object he believes and
intends to the very person he believes and intends.  That is so whether or not
his willingness and decision to do so stem from fraud, forgetfulness, or
spontaneous mistake, so long as the chattel and the recipients are the ones he
intends.  But if he mixes up recipients, or mixes up property, and gets the
wrong chattel or wrong recipient, no property passes.  That is so whatever
caused his mistake, be it fraud or mishap.

 

                   Here
the Hudson's Bay Co. intended to issue a cheque to National, and issued it just
as intended with National as payee.  They intended to deliver it to National,
and got it into the hands of National.  They intended National to negotiate it
and keep the proceeds, and National did so.  The Hudson's Bay Co. did not
confuse payees or property.  The Hudson's Bay Co. succeeded: they got the
property intended into the hands of the intended recipient.  They knew, but
forgot or overlooked, that they did not have to do so.  Property passed.  The
Hudson's Bay Co. gained a civil cause of action for a like sum, but lost
property in the cheque and its proceeds.  Neither [the respondent] nor his
company National did anything to induce that payment.

 

                   Since in the
present case, it was the intention of the Hudson's Bay Co. to transfer property
in the proceeds of the second cheque to Mr. Milne, property did in fact
pass.  The fact that this intention was based on the mistaken belief that the
Hudson's Bay Co. owed Mr. Milne the money did not prevent the passing of
money, though it created a civil cause of action for its return.

 

                   Côté J.A.
noted that the nature and validity of the underlying contractual relationship
were quite irrelevant to the question whether property passed through the
second cheque (at p. 20):

 

And
I agree that the test here is not whether there is operative mistake making
void a contract.  (No one here suggests property was to pass or not pass by
contract.  It was to pass or not pass by wording the payee of the cheque and by
mere delivery.)

 

                   Having set out the
civil law relating to property in this manner, Côté J.A. observed that it
was not imperative that the civil law relating to property and the criminal law
relating to theft should accord completely.  However, any other result would
lead to anomalies.  Indeed, commercial practicality pointed in the same
direction as the civil legal principles.  For instance, the ongoing web of
payments between two companies is often complex and overpayments and allegation
of overpayment are common.  Côté J.A. noted that if mistaken overpayment
did not transfer property, a new kind of preference in bankruptcy would exist
that had not been noticed before.  Côté J.A. also noted that the most
commercially practical response to the receipt of a mistakenly paid cheque may
often be to deposit it and then arrange for a refund cheque to be issued.  If
property never passes in the first place, even this could amount to theft.

 

                   Côté J.A.
rejected any application of trust principles or the law of conversion to this
case (at p. 21):

 

                   In
this case there is no question of a ""special property"".  On anyone's
view, all property passed to National or none of it did.  Here there was no
bailment, conditional sales contract, trust, or other split property, in the
eyes of criminal law or civil law.  The Hudson's Bay Co. did not retain any
property interest of any kind: Barclay's Bank v. Simms, supra.

 

                   Nothing
turns here on conversion.  The doctrine extends the common law notion of what
is a taking, and extends theft to cover those who already have possession.  It
does nothing to change whether property passes or does not pass.  Nor does it
affect who is the owner whose goods are taken or converted.

 

                   Finally,
Côté J.A. noted that while Mr. Milne was certainly dishonest in his
dealings with the second cheque, this particular form of dishonesty did not
amount to theft, and could be dealt with in a number of other ways under the Criminal
Code .

 

                   For these reasons,
the majority in the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, and set aside the
conviction.

 

                   In dissent,
McClung J.A. disagreed with the majority's conclusion that property in the
proceeds of the second cheque had passed in law to Mr. Milne.  According
to him, the law of unilateral mistake intervened on behalf of the Hudson's Bay
Co. and avoided the transaction.  Because the Hudson's Bay Co. tendered the sum
of $16,981 for services that had been paid for earlier, it was mistaken as to a
fundamental term of the transaction, and this mistake was recognized by
Mr. Milne.  ""On those facts the contract was not merely voidable, but
void, and no rights could be created by it"" (p. 6).  Hence no title to the
funds was passed.

 

                   McClung J.A.
also held that a ""special property or interest"" in the funds pursuant
to s. 322(1)(a) of the Code had been retained by the Hudson's Bay
Co.  According to him, such an interest may derive from the nature of the
transaction between the payer and the recipient of the funds.  Applying those
principles to the facts, he concluded that the funds had been entrusted to
Mr. Milne, through his company, for the payment of the services earlier
rendered.  These services had already been paid and were known to have been
paid, and therefore, the proceeds of the cheque remained impressed with a
trust, freezing a beneficial and special interest in the funds in the Hudson's
Bay Co.

 

II --  Analysis

 

                   Mr. Milne could not
be convicted of theft on the basis of his having taken something from the
Hudson's Bay Co.  The cheque was in the possession of Mr. Milne, through
his company, without any taking on his part.  Therefore, Mr. Milne can
only be convicted of theft if he fraudulently and without colour of right
converted the money to his use with the intent to deprive the Hudson's Bay Co.
of its property or ""special property or interest"" in it.  It is the
doctrine of conversion which covers a case such as this one where the initial
possession of the thing in question was gained without a taking.

 

                   In determining
whether Mr. Milne converted the money to his own use, the key issue is
whether the Hudson's Bay Co. in fact retained an interest in the money after
possession had been transferred to Mr. Milne, due to Mr. Milne's
knowledge of its mistake.  The majority in the Court of Appeal carefully
analyse this issue on the basis of the law of property.  Côté J.A. noted
that there is a distinction in property cases between circumstances in which a
mistake operates to void a transaction ab initio, so that property never
passes, and other circumstances in which the mistake merely renders the
transaction voidable, which entitles the grieved party to a remedy, either in
damages or by way of constructive trust, but does not prevent the initial
transfer of property.

 

                   As noted above,
Côté J.A. held that this distinction turns on the kind of mistake made by
the transferor.  If the mistake relates to the identity of the object or the
recipient, then the transfer is void.  If the mistake instead relates to the
reason for the transfer, it is voidable.  In this case, since the Hudson's Bay
Co.'s mistake related to the reason for the transfer, not the object or the
recipient, the transfer was merely voidable.

 

                   The Crown objects
to Côté J.A.'s analysis of the distinction between void and voidable
transfers on the basis that such an analysis ought to focus on the owner's
subjective intention, rather than his objective intention.  To focus on
objective intent is said to be inconsistent with the general principle of the
criminal law, which is to examine subjective intent.

 

                   This is, however, a
misconception of the distinction identified by Côté J.A.  This distinction
does not turn on the difference between objective and subjective intent.  In
speaking of the intent of the transferor, it is clear that Côté J.A. means
subjective, not objective intent.  For instance, Côté J.A. considers that
when a bank mistakenly deposits money into the wrong person's account, this is
a mistake which prevents property from passing.  Yet the objective intent,
visible to the outside observer, would be to pass property.  It is the
subjective intent not to do so which is relevant, according to Côté J.A.

 

                   In this case, both
the subjective and objective intention of the Hudson's Bay Co. was to pass
property in the cheque.  What the Crown identifies as the subjective intent not
to pass property relates instead, in terms of the criminal law, to the motive
for the transaction.  In this case, the motive of the Hudson's Bay Co. was to
pay Mr. Milne's company for services rendered.  Of course, this motivation
was based on an error, in that payment had already been made, yet given this
error the Hudson's Bay Co. fully intended for property in the second cheque to
pass to Mr. Milne's company.  The law of property creates a right of
recovery because of the particular character of the mistaken motive in this
case.  However, this does not mean that the Hudson's Bay Co. did not intend
property to pass.

 

                   Therefore, the
nature of the distinction identified by Côté J.A. is not contrary to the
general precepts of criminal law.  Indeed, there is a sense in which it is
consonant with those precepts, in so far as it focuses upon intent as
distinguished from motive.  However, assuming that the method by which Côté J.A.
distinguishes between void and voidable mistaken transfers is correct, be it
from the point of view of property law or criminal law, there remains the
logically prior question as to whether the distinction itself is necessary or
has any purpose in the context of the criminal law.  As can be seen in R. v.
Stewart, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 963, issues surrounding the law of property may
look very different in the context of the criminal law than in the context of
the civil law, where the purposes of these two branches of law differ.

 

                   The purpose of the
distinction between void and voidable in the context of the law of property is
largely (though perhaps not exclusively) to protect innocent third parties who
have relied on the legitimacy of the transaction which has apparently taken
place.  Such a purpose has no analogue in the criminal law.  The criminal law
is concerned with the guilt or innocence of the accused, and to this end
focuses on the actions and knowledge of the accused.  The criminal law does not
affect the interests of third parties in the way that the law of property can. 
The fact that Mr. Milne in a case such as this may face criminal sanction
for his acts would not affect the property claim of an innocent third party to
whom the property had passed in the meantime.

 

                   Indeed, it would be
perfectly consistent with the purposes and traditions of the criminal law to
focus on the knowledge of the accused in order to determine whether property
had passed.  This conclusion is consistent with some of the prior cases dealing
with this issue.  In Brochu v. The King (1950), 10 C.R. 183 (Que. K.B.),
the accused was overpaid by $1,000 when cashing a cheque.  When the error was
pointed out to him, the accused denied that he had received the extra funds,
and attempted to use those funds in a number of ways.  In deciding that the
accused was guilty of theft, Marchand J. focused on the accused's
knowledge of the bank's mistake, rather than the nature of that mistake (at
pp. 191-92):

 

                   [translation]  I italicize the words
""taking or converting to the use"", the very clear meaning of
which goes far beyond the discussions of the common law, and I see in them that
anyone who has received, through the unilateral error of an owner, a thing to
which he has no right, and decides to convert it to his own use, to keep it,
when the mistake that has given it to him is pointed out to him, creates for
himself a fraudulent title, takes fraudulently and without colour of
right, with intent to deprive the owner, with full animus furandi, and
makes himself guilty of the theft of this thing.

 

                   In the case of R.
v. Johnson, [1978] 6 W.W.R. 97 (Man. C.A.), the majority also focuses on
the accused's knowledge of the mistake, rather than the type of mistake.  In
that case, funds were mistakenly deposited by a bank into the accused's
account, and the accused, knowing that he was not entitled to them, withdrew
and spent the funds.  Monnin J.A. found that spending the money
constituted conversion, and the knowledge of the mistake was sufficient to make
this theft (at p. 99):

 

                   Under
the plain ordinary interpretation that would be made by any citizen and under
the plain legal interpretation of s. 283 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, which defines theft, even if the accused's conduct in taking something
which he very well knew was not his may not by itself have amounted to theft,
his conduct in then fraudulently and without colour of right converting that
money to his own use certainly constituted theft.  The accused was not entitled
to this sum of money and he very well knew it: ""I almost flipped
out"".  In my view that is all that is required to make this conversion of
the money a theft for which the accused ought to have been found guilty.

 

                   Both of these cases
can be reconciled with the approach suggested by the majority in the Court of
Appeal, but are more obviously consistent with a focus on the knowledge of the
accused.

 

                   However, the case
of R. v. Dawood, [1976] 1 W.W.R. 262 (Alta. S.C., App. Div.), must be
overruled if the knowledge of the accused is to be the critical factor.  In Dawood,
the accused switched price tags on merchandise, and then presented the altered
merchandise to a cashier for payment.  The majority in the Court of Appeal saw
this as an offer to purchase the merchandise for the altered price, which offer
was accepted by the cashier.  The transaction was therefore voidable, not void,
and property had passed.  In light of the accused's knowledge of the mistake
made by the cashier, property would not have passed for the purpose of the
criminal law if the knowledge of the accused is the controlling factor.

 

                   In the present
case, it is absolutely clear that Mr. Milne knew that he was not entitled
to the proceeds of the second cheque.  Since Mr. Milne knew of the mistake
of the transferor, and the mistake was of a kind which by virtue of the law of
property gave rise to a right of recovery, property did not pass for the
purpose of criminal law.

 

                   In light of this
conclusion, it is not necessary to discuss the scope of the ""special
property or interest"" referred to in s. 322  of the Criminal Code .

 

III --  Conclusion

 

                   Where a transferor
mistakenly transfers property to a recipient, and the recipient knows of the
mistake, property does not pass for the purpose of the criminal law if the law
of property creates a right of recovery, no matter whether the original transfer
is said to be void or voidable.  The distinction between void and voidable
transfers has no purpose in the context of the criminal law.  In either case,
where the law of property provides at least a right of recovery, property does
not pass for the purpose of the criminal law.  If the recipient then converts
the property to his own use, fraudulently and without colour of right, and with
intent to deprive the transferor of the property, he is guilty of theft. 

 

                   In this case, the
trial judge found that Mr. Milne was aware that the second cheque had been
issued to his company by mistake, and knew that he had been paid with a prior
cheque.  Therefore, property in the cheque did not pass to Mr. Milne's
company for the purpose of the criminal law.  The trial judge also found that
when Mr. Milne wrote cheques to himself on the company's account that
reduced the balance to almost nil, this amounted to converting that money to
his own use with intent to deprive the Hudson's Bay Co. of its property.  This
conversion was done fraudulently and without colour of right, since
Mr. Milne was aware that the cheque had been issued by mistake. 
Therefore, Mr. Milne was guilty of theft. 

 

                   Other cases, such
as those referred to in the judgment of Côté J.A. in the Court of Appeal,
will raise different issues.  For instance, a case in which the recipient only
discovered after converting a cheque to his own use that it had been sent by
mistake would raise a number of issues not raised in this case, as would a
situation where the recipient was entitled to some but not all of the proceeds
of the cheque, or where a set-off was involved, or where the recipient merely
deposited the cheque without any further acts to convert it to his own use. 
The resolution of these issues may be left to other cases.

 

                   I would therefore
allow the appeal and restore the conviction.

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Demand for blood samples ‑‑ Whether demand must incorporate

                   The accused was involved in a
motor vehicle accident and sustained several injuries. At the hospital where he
was taken for treatment, a police officer advised him of his right to retain
and instruct counsel without delay. The officer, who had reasonable grounds to
believe that the accused had been drinking, made a demand for blood samples
under s. 254(3)  of the Criminal Code .  The demand did not
incorporate the assurances of s. 254(4)  that the samples of blood would
only be taken by or under the direction of a qualified medical practitioner and
that the taking of the samples would not endanger the person's life or health.
The accused refused and was charged with failing to comply with a demand to
provide samples of his blood contrary to s. 254(5) .  He was acquitted at
trial and the acquittal affirmed by the Court of Appeal.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   A demand for blood samples by

                   The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

 

                   La Forest J. --
On June 25, 1989, the respondent was involved in a single vehicle accident.  He
sustained several injuries including a cut on his forehead and a fracture of
his femur above the right knee.  The ambulance attendants detected the odour of
alcohol on the respondent.  He told them he had been drinking.  The respondent
was taken to the hospital for treatment.  When the ambulance attendants left the
examination room, they spoke to Corporal Holmes of the R.C.M.P.  Corporal
Holmes entered the examination room and spoke to the respondent who was
complaining of pain in his leg.  He advised the respondent of his right to
retain and instruct counsel without delay.  He then read the following demand:

 

I demand you
provide such samples of your blood as in the opinion of a qualified medical
practitioner or qualified technician taking the samples are necessary to
determine the concentrations if any of alcohol in your blood.  Should you
refuse this demand, you will be charged with the offence of Refusal.

 

The respondent refused the demand.  He was
charged with refusing to comply with a demand to provide samples of his blood
contrary to s. 254(5)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .

 

                   The respondent was acquitted
at trial in the Nova Scotia Provincial Court.  The Crown's appeal was dismissed
by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia:  (1990), 100 N.S.R.
(2d) 82, 272 A.P.R. 82, 60 C.C.C. (3d) 362, 25 M.V.R. (2d) 281.  Leave to
appeal to this Court was then granted, [1991] 1 S.C.R. xiii.

 

                   The relevant provisions of the
Code read as follows:

 

                   254.     . . .

 

                   (3) 
Where a peace officer believes on reasonable and probable grounds that a person
is committing, or at any time within the preceding two hours has committed, as
a result of the consumption of alcohol, an offence under section 253, the peace
officer may, by demand made to that person forthwith or as soon as practicable,
require that person to provide then or as soon thereafter as is practicable

 

                   (a)   such
samples of the person's breath as in the opinion of a qualified technician, or

 

                   (b)   where
the peace officer has reasonable and probable grounds to believe that, by
reason of any physical condition of the person,

 

                   (i)
the person may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or

 

                   (ii)
it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of the person's breath,

 

                   such
samples of the person's blood, under the conditions referred to in subsection
(4), as in the opinion of the qualified medical practitioner or qualified
technician taking the samples

 

are necessary
to enable proper analysis to be made in order to determine the concentration,
if any, of alcohol in the person's blood, and to accompany the peace officer
for the purpose of enabling such samples to be taken.

 

                   (4) 
Samples of blood may only be taken from a person pursuant to a demand made by a
peace officer under subsection (3) if the samples are taken by or under the
direction of a qualified medical practitioner and the qualified medical
practitioner is satisfied that the taking of those samples would not endanger
the life or health of the person.

 

                   (5) 
Every one commits an offence who, without reasonable excuse, fails or refuses
to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer under this section.

 

                   This case raises the issue of
whether a demand for blood samples by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(3) 
must incorporate the assurances of s. 254(4)  that the samples of blood will
only be taken by or under the direction of a qualified medical practitioner and
only if the qualified medical practitioner is satisfied that the taking of
those samples would not endanger the life or health of the patient.  In other
words, it raises the question whether the phrase ""under the conditions
referred to in subsection (4)"", which appears in s. 254(3) , should be
interpreted as describing what the demand should contain.  In my view it
should.  Otherwise, the phrase would be surplusage.  Parliament's purpose
appears to be directed to putting to rest the fear that an improper procedure
might be followed or that unqualified persons might conduct the procedure.  The
danger is that a person might be prompted to refuse to take the test on such
grounds.  While a detained person has the right to counsel under s. 10 (b)
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , it must be remembered
that the blood sample, unlike a breath test, may be taken in circumstances
where a person is particularly vulnerable.  Finally, while s. 254(3)  is not a
model of clarity, any ambiguity should be resolved in favour of the accused.  Because
the demand made to the respondent was not validly made under s. 254(3)  as thus
interpreted, the respondent cannot be convicted under s. 254(5)  for the offence
of failing to comply with a demand under s. 254 .

 

                   I note that following the
decision in the courts below, the R.C.M.P. issued new demand cards adding the
following sentence to the previous notice:

 

Blood samples
will only be taken by or under the direction of a qualified medical
practitioner and if the qualified medical practitioner is satisfied that the
taking of the samples will not endanger your life or health.

 

A demand made in accordance with this new form
would, in my view, comply with the requirements of s. 254(3) .

 

                   I would dismiss the appeal.

 

                   Appeal dismissed.

                   Appellant pleaded
not guilty to the indictable offence of assault causing bodily harm and to
assault (which was dealt with summarily).  The charges arose from separate
incidents.  When appellant appeared on the assault causing bodily harm charge,
he elected trial before a provincial court judge thereby foregoing a
preliminary inquiry.  Both matters were put over to the same date.  Defence
counsel, when the matter came on to be heard,  proposed that it would be more
efficient to deal with both charges at once and the Crown consented.  Appellant
was convicted of both charges.

 

                   Appellant's appeal
to the Summary Conviction Appeal Court from conviction for assault was not
resolved when the appeal from conviction for assault causing bodily harm was
heard and dismissed by the Court of Appeal.

 

                   At issue here
were:  (1) whether the proceedings constituted two separate trials with the
evidence in one trial applying in the other trial; (2) whether a court has
jurisdiction to try two separate informations in a single trial; (3) whether a
summary conviction offence and an indictable offence can be properly joined and
tried together; and (4) whether the proceedings constituted a procedural
irregularity, and if so, whether s. 686(1) (b)(iv) of the Criminal
Code  could be applied to uphold a conviction.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.  

 

                   When joinder of
offences, or of accuseds, is being considered, the court should seek the
consent of both the accused and the prosecution.  If consent is withheld, the
reasons should be explored.  Whether the accused consents or not, joinder
should occur only when, in the court's opinion, it is in the interests of
justice and the offences or accuseds could initially have been jointly
charged.  Here, a trial was conducted simultaneously as regards two distinct
informations.  This was done at the suggestion of the defence and, therefore,
with the accused's consent and that of the Crown.

 

                   While an elaborate
procedure is provided under the Criminal Code  for joint trials, all that
has to be done is that, to the extent possible, the same procedure should be
followed when joining indictments.

 

                   Accused persons
being dealt with in separate informations at the same time should not be any
more compellable against each other, especially in light of s. 11 (c) of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , than when tried on one
single information or indictment.  When two or more accused in different
informations are charged with the same offence or with different offences, if
they are proceeded against jointly, they will not be compellable one against
the other.  When the Crown chooses to proceed at the same time, the Crown then
waives the right to call one accused against the other, as is the case of
proceeding against the two accused on the same document.  An accused who might
wish to testify with respect to only one information should not and would not
give his or her consent to a joint trial; and, when consent is withheld, under
such circumstances it would be inappropriate for the judge to order a joint
trial.

 

                   Joinder can be
effected between charges for summary convictions and charges for indictable
offences, notwithstanding the difference in procedure.  The difference of the
process as regards indictable offences and summary convictions must, however,
be kept in mind.  That indictable offences must on some occasions, and may in
others, be tried by a judge and a jury, is an impediment to proceeding jointly
when before that court with a summary conviction.  That preliminary inquiries
are available for most indictable offences is another impediment for the
joinder of trials.  

 

                   Summary convictions
should be joined with indictable offences only where the accused has waived the
right to be tried in a higher court (either with or without a jury) and has
also foregone his or her right to a preliminary hearing.  Joinder therefore may
occur only where trial on the indictable offence is to take place before the
provincial court.  In the event of any conflict as to the applicable procedure,
indictable offence procedures should apply.

 

                   Where an issue
common to both informations has gone to the Summary Conviction Appeal Court and
the Court of Appeal, the Summary Conviction Appeal Court should await decision
by the higher court.

 

                   Proceeding jointly
here did not constitute a procedural irregularity.

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

 

                   Lamer
C.J. -- In R. v.
Kennedy, [1971] 2 O.R. 445, Kelly J.A. made the following pronouncement at
pp. 447-48:

 

                   In
my view, one vital objective of criminal procedure is to ensure that no person
exposed to prosecution shall be found guilty otherwise than by the
instrumentality of a trial conducted in a manner which will not prejudice him
in making his full answer and defence to the charge against him; accordingly,
the gravity of any alleged procedural deviation is to be assessed in relation
to the extent to which that objective may thereby be impeded.

 

                   While
I would not countenance any departure from the rigidity with which I believe
that this principle should be applied in favour of the accused, I am firmly of
the opinion that the importance of departures from the traditional form of
procedure from which no prejudice arises should not be so escalated as to
result in the invalidity of the proceedings where a Court is satisfied that the
result would have been the same had the trial proceeded in the manner in which
it is alleged it should have.

 

In the case of In re Clayton,
[1983] 2 W.L.R. 555, Lord Roskill said at pp. 562‑63:

 

Magistrates'
courts today try the vast majority of criminal cases that arise for hearing in
this country as well as many civil cases.  Any rule of practice or procedure
which makes their task more difficult or demands subservience to technicalities
is to be deprecated and your Lordships may think that this House should now
encourage the adoption of rules of procedure and practice which encourage the
better attainment of justice, which includes the interests of the prosecution
as well as of defendants, so long as the necessary safeguards are maintained to
prevent any risk of injustice to defendants.

 

                   I share this
approach to criminal procedure and therefore welcome the opportunity afforded
us in this appeal to reconsider this Court's decision in Phillips and
Phillips v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 161, and Khan v. The Queen,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 62.

 

Introduction

 

                   This is an appeal
from a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal, dismissing Clunas' appeal from
a conviction for assault causing bodily harm entered by a provincial court
judge of Ontario.

 

                   The facts need not
be entered into at any great length, as we are here concerned with procedure
rather than evidence.  On September 9, 1988, the appellant and his former
girlfriend became involved in an argument which culminated in a physical fight
in which two of the woman's fingers were broken.  As a result of this, the
appellant was charged with assault causing bodily harm, an indictable offence. 
In the early morning of September 11, 1988, they became involved in another
argument which culminated in the appellant's being charged with assault.  The
charges were contained in separate informations.

 

                   On December 9,
1988, the appellant appeared on the assault charge, which the Crown elected to
proceed with summarily.  He pleaded not guilty and a trial date was set for
April 20, 1989.  On January 31, 1989, the appellant appeared on the assault
causing bodily harm charge, an indictable offence, and elected trial before a
provincial court judge, that is, foregoing the holding of a preliminary
inquiry.  He indicated he would be pleading not guilty, and the matter was put
over to April 20, 1989.

 

                   On April 20, 1989,
the appellant appeared before the court.  Crown counsel advised the judge

 

There
are two charges before the court....  One is a charge of assault causing bodily
harm upon one Margaret Gray on the 9th day of September of 1988; second is a
charge of common assault upon the same person two days later.  I don't know how
Your Honour wishes to deal with it.  If Your Honour does not want to hear both
of them I'm prepared to deal with the first and more serious charge at this
time which is a charge of assault causing bodily harm.

 

The judge indicated he would take the
pleas.  Defence counsel then spoke: 

 

Your
Honour, these two charges, I appreciate that they're on separate informations,
but there are a couple of witnesses that Mr. Clunas has brought to court today
whose evidence is really one story that flows through from the Saturday night
incident to the Sunday morning incident, which is actually Saturday night at a
bar.  Unless you want to have the witnesses coming up and stepping down again,
it's my suggestion it might be more efficient to deal with them both at once. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   In response to the
trial judge's question, the Crown indicated that it consented to this
procedure.  The matter then proceeded.

 

                   The appellant was
convicted of both charges.  He appealed his conviction for assault causing
bodily harm to the Court of Appeal for Ontario which, as I said, dismissed his
appeal.  Goodman J.A. dissenting, would have set aside the conviction and
ordered a new trial.

 

                   The appellant
appealed his conviction on the assault charge to the Summary Conviction Appeal
Court.  That appeal had not been resolved as of the date of the Court of Appeal
hearing on the assault causing bodily harm charge.

 

Judgments

 

Court of Appeal (1991), 2 O.R. (3d) 1

 

                   Referring to Phillips,
supra, and Khan, supra, Doherty J.A. agreed that the
appellant was on ""solid jurisprudential footing"".  After reviewing
the sequence of events, Doherty J.A. concluded that there had not been a single
trial on separate charges.  He understood defence counsel's remarks to mean
that ""all of the evidence would be relevant to both charges"".  He
distinguished this case from R v. Pottinger (1990), 54 C.C.C. (3d) 246
(Ont. C.A.), as defence counsel here was quite aware of the fact that the
charges were on separate informations, which was not the case in Pottinger.

 

                   Doherty J.A.
acknowledged that the transcript was capable of a different interpretation, but
preferred his interpretation to ""one which would depict counsel as
unknowingly or, worse yet, deliberately embarking on a course that yielded a
nullity"".  He expressed no opinion as to the assault charge or the
applicability of the curative provision of the Criminal Code .

 

                   Goodman J.A.
reviewed the evidence and concluded that there was no indication that the trial
judge had reviewed and considered the evidence separately as it related to both
charges.  Further, Goodman J.A. noted at p. 11 that the two charges related to
separate incidents which occurred more than 24 hours apart.  Although he could
see how the evidence relating to the first charge would be relevant to the
second, he could not see how the evidence relating to the latter charge would
be relevant to the first.  Goodman J.A. was of the view, at p. 12, that
""the statements made by the trial judge and counsel for the parties, and
the manner in which the trial was conducted and judgment given, clearly
indicate that the two informations were tried together.""  He concluded
that the statements by the trial judge and counsel were not sufficient to
indicate an awareness of the consequences, on the reasoning in Phillips
and Khan, of trying the matters together.  He could not distinguish this
situation from Phillips.  He distinguished Matheson v. The Queen,
[1981] 2 S.C.R. 214, on the basis that it dealt with evidentiary issues, rather
than the issues raised by Phillips and Khan.  Goodman J.A. would
have held that the trial judge had no jurisdiction to try the matters
together.  Further, Pottinger could not be distinguished and, therefore,
the curative provisions of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ,
were not available.  He would have ordered a new trial.

 

                   Grange J.A. agreed
with the reasoning and result reached by Doherty J.A.  However, he added that,
while he agreed with Goodman J.A. concerning the difficulty in distinguishing Pottinger
from the case at bar, he found that not applying the curative provisions
appeared to be inconsistent with R. v. Cloutier (1988), 43 C.C.C. 35
(Ont. C.A.).

 

The Issues

 

                   Given the approach
I intend to take in this appeal, the issues that I will be addressing will be
as follows:

 

1.Did
the proceedings in this case constitute two separate trials with the evidence
in one trial applying in the other trial?

 

2.Does
a court have jurisdiction to try two separate informations in a single trial?

 

3.Is
it proper to join counts of a summary conviction offence and an indictable
offence and try them together?

 

4.Did
the proceedings constitute a procedural irregularity?  If so, can s. 686(1) (b)(iv)
of the Criminal Code  be applied to uphold a conviction?

 

Issue No. 1

 

                   After the exchange
I have quoted above, the trial judge then asked the following of counsel of the
Crown:  ""Do you wish to deal with both of them at the same time?"" 
Counsel for the Crown responded, ""Yes"".  The trial judge then said, ""I'll
hear both of them.""

 

                   The Crown called
evidence and some of the witnesses testified as to both alleged assaults.  In
the course of making objections reference was made to the fact, in support of
the question objected to, that the questions objected to related to a defence
of self-defence.  In that regard, the following exchange took place between the
trial judge and defence counsel:

 

Mr. Dobbie:The evidence is being led in respect of two charges, Your Honour.

 

The Court:Yes.

 

Mr. Dobbie:And I've already said that there will be evidence called that relates
to a defence of self-defence.  I don't know why I'm being asked to repeat that.

 

The Court:On these two counts.

 

Mr. Dobbie:At least on the Saturday night incident, yes.

 

The Court:All right.

 

                   The appellant, when
called upon to testify, testified concerning both incidents and as to the
background relationship to Ms. Gray, the alleged victim.  Two other witnesses
were called by the defence.  One of them testified about the incident on September
9, and the other testified concerning the September 11 altercation. 
Immediately after the completion of the evidence, the following exchange took
place:

 

The Court:Thank you.  Any reply evidence?

 

Mr. McHugh:No, Your Honour.

 

The Court:    All right.  Argument then,
please.

 

Both counsel then argued and then the
court concluded as follows:

 

The Court:Thank you.  Stand up, Mr. Clunas.  Mr. Clunas, on all the evidence
brought before this Court and after weighing all the facts very carefully,
there will be a conviction registered against you on both counts.  I find you
guilty.  I attach very little credibility to your evidence or that of your
witnesses.  I don't know whether they were even there the evidence they gave
....  I accept the Crown's evidence.  Any prior record?

 

                   It seems to me
that, if there had been an agreement to proceed upon one case and to read in
the evidence from that case into another case, a motion to that effect would
have been made.  It is clear to me, with all due respect for contrary views,
that we are here facing a situation where a trial was conducted simultaneously
as regards two distinct informations.  This was done at the suggestion of the
defence and, therefore, with the accused's consent.  That is also amply clear
to me.  

 

Issue No. 2

 

                   This, therefore,
takes us to the second issue, which is whether a court has jurisdiction to do
this.  In Khan, supra, it was decided that this could not be
done.  The case in Khan was on all fours with the present case.  The
appellant was charged in separate informations with an indictable offence and
with a summary conviction offence.  She elected trial by magistrate prior to
entering a plea on the indictable offence, was arraigned on both counts, and
entered pleas of not guilty.  Both informations were tried together and she was
convicted on each.

 

                   She appealed her
conviction and sentences, but the Court of Appeal concluded that there was
evidence to sustain the conviction and that the sentences were not
inappropriate.  This Court, on July 26, 1984 and some nine months after Phillips,
supra, held that the trial judge in light of the principles pronounced
by this Court in Phillips, was without jurisdiction to try together the
separate informations, and that the Khan case was not distinguishable
from Phillips.

 

                   This issue comes
back to us now, 7 1/2 years after Khan and close to nine years after Phillips.

 

                   Phillips is a case where two appellants were
charged in separate informations with hunting with a light contrary to the New
Brunswick Game Act, R.S.N.B. 1973, c. G-1.  A third person was also
charged in a third information of wilfully obstructing police officers in the
execution of their duty, contrary to s. 118(a) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  All charges arose out of the same incident.  

 

                   Counsel all agreed
that the defendants be tried together.  The appellants' convictions in
Provincial Court were upheld by the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of
Appeal.  They then appealed to our Court to determine whether the trial judge
had jurisdiction to try more than one information at the same time.

 

                   This Court
(Ritchie, Dickson, McIntyre, Chouinard and Wilson JJ.) held that, even with the
consent of counsel of the parties, a trial judge is without jurisdiction to try
together separate informations or indictments.  The principle applies to
charges laid under the Criminal Code  or under provincial statutes,
unless those statutes expressly provide otherwise.

 

                   The first ground
relied upon by this Court was the fact that the decision in Crane v.
Director of Public Prosecutions, [1921] 2 A.C. 299 (a case from the House
of Lords handed down in 1921), reflected ancient and current practice at the
time of the hearing in Phillips.  Indeed, the judgment of the Court, at
p. 164, quoted Lord Atkinson in that case at p. 321, saying:

 

When
an accused person has pleaded ""Not guilty"" to the offences charged
against him in an indictment, and another accused person has pleaded ""Not
guilty"" to the offence or offences charged against him in another separate
and independent indictment it is, I have always understood, elementary in
criminal law, that the issues raised by those two pleas cannot be tried
together.

 

                   Reference was also
made to R. v. Dennis, [1924] 1 K.B. 867, which followed Crane.  A
series of appellate cases in Canada was then listed where the rule enunciated
in Crane had been consistently followed, whether in cases of multiple
accused or in cases of a single accused charged on one or more than one
indictment or information.  Cases where the rule applied to summary convictions
under provincial statutes were also referred to and the conclusion, at p. 164,
was:

 

The
overwhelming weight of authority in Canada, based upon the Crane case, supra,
is against a joint trial of more than one indictment or information.

 

But the Court did not rest the whole
decision on ancient practice (at pp. 169‑70, per McIntyre
J.):

 

                   I
would be reluctant to rest my decision in this case solely on the basis of
ancient practice.  I agree with the Ontario Court of Appeal that there is no
reason why we should be required to be bound by authority which serves no real
purpose and rests upon no sound principle applicable in a modern society.  We
must not, however, cast aside rules merely because they are of long standing or
because they may seem in certain cases to be inconvenient.  Can it be said then
that the rule against joint trials of separate indictments or informations
serves no purpose and is based on no sound principle?

 

It then set out a second set of
grounds for supporting the principle enunciated in Crane.  Those grounds
are set out in the judgment at pp. 170‑71, as follows:

 

                   The
joinder of two or more indictments or informations for trial raises
fundamentally different problems from those which arise in the joint trials of
several persons accused under one indictment or information.  An elaborate
procedure is provided under the Criminal Code  covering joint trials but
no such procedure is to be found to deal with questions arising upon a joinder
of indictments.  Consider, for example, the application of the rule that an
accused person is not compellable as a witness at his own trial.  Where two
accused are charged on separate indictments or informations and tried together
in one proceeding there is nothing to prevent the Crown from calling one
accused as a witness to testify with respect to the indictment or information
charging the other accused because, in respect of that indictment, he does not
enjoy the protection accorded an accused person.  The risk of prejudice is
immediately apparent and the Crown would in this way obtain an advantage not
permitted or even contemplated by the Code, provisions.  It could be
argued no doubt that the evidence so given would be admissible only against the
co-accused but on what principle it could be so limited may be somewhat
obscure.  Certainly any protection the witness might claim under s. 5 of the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, would be rendered completely illusory. 
Such protection against the use of the evidence against him applies only to
future proceedings and not to those in progress when the evidence is given. 
One may consider as well the case of an accused charged in two separate
indictments or informations with different offences.  It may be advantageous
for him to testify with respect to one charge but not to the other.  Such an
advantage is lost if both indictments are tried together.  This problem to be
sure may arise where an accused is charged with separate counts on one
indictment or information, but where this occurs he enjoys the protection of
the detailed procedural provisions of the Code relating to severance. 
While in retrospect, that is to say, from the vantage point of the appellate
courts, it may be possible in any given case to conclude that no prejudice
resulted from a joinder for trial of two indictments or informations, it would
be impossible for a trial judge to foresee at the outset of the trial all
possible consequences of such a joinder.  The dangers then of prejudice and
injustice are such that they outweigh any advantage or consideration of
efficiency thought to be gained by the joinder.

 

The Court then found support for this
approach in the Criminal Code  when it stated, at p. 171:

 

                   It
should also be pointed out that the common law rule against joint trials of
separate indictments or informations has been incorporated by implication into
the Criminal Code .  Throughout the Code, reference is made to
trial on the indictment or the information.  Even the provisions
in relation to multiple counts and severance indicate that a trial is to
proceed on one indictment or information.  If it had been contemplated by
Parliament that more than one information or indictment could be tried at the
same time, these provisions for joinder or severance would have been
unnecessary.

 

                   Concerning the
first set of grounds relied upon by this Court in Phillips, it is to be
noted that the practice has, since Crane, supra, been changed in
England by the decision of the House of Lords in In re Clayton, supra. 
This, of course, is not conclusive, since this Court is not bound by the
decisions of the House of Lords.  Therefore, I will proceed to address the
second set of grounds referred to in Phillips.  With respect, I do not
feel that those problems contemplated in Phillips will arise.

 

                   While an elaborate
procedure is provided under the Criminal Code  for joint trials, all that
has to be done is that to the extent possible the same procedure be followed
when joining indictments.  For joint trials, the same procedure could be
followed when proceeding simultaneously on multiple informations.

 

                   I do not think,
furthermore, that accused persons being dealt with in separate informations at
the same time should be any more compellable against each other, especially in
light of s. 11 (c) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ,
than when tried on one single information or indictment.  When two or more
accused in different informations are charged with the same offence or with
different offences, if they are proceeded against jointly they will not be
compellable one against the other.  When the Crown chooses to proceed at the
same time, the Crown then waives the right to call one accused against the
other, as is the case of proceeding against the two accused on the same
document.

 

                   I, therefore, with
respect for contrary views, do not think that the problem referred to in Phillips
arises.  As regards the concern for an accused who might wish to testify with
respect to only one of the informations, I think that such a problem would not
arise, as it is a case where consent by the accused to a joint trial should and
would not be given; and, when consent is withheld, under such circumstances it
would be inappropriate for the judge to order a joint trial.

 

                   As regards the
third and fourth concerns alluded to by the Court, counsel for the respondent
in his factum said the following:

 

...
the court raised the issue of interpretation of provisions in the Code
referring only to a trial on the ""Information"" or
""Indictment"", always worded in the singular.  Pursuant to the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1985, I-21 , s. 33(2) :

 

33(2)words
in the singular include the plural, and words in the plural include the
singular.

 

Therefore,
it is submitted that the provisions in the Code relating to trial can be
interpreted as referring to the plural ""Information"" or
""Indictment"".  The court's fourth concern related to the Code's
provision for only one type of joint trial.... [I]t is submitted that the Code
provisions as to joinder and severance are not exhaustive, and should not be
interpreted so as to exclude a procedure of joint trials permitted by common
law.  In addition, it is noteworthy that there is no section in the Code
prohibiting a joint trial of separate Informations.

 

                   I agree with the
respondent's argument.  

 

                   To conclude this
portion of the judgment, I would say that when joinder of offences, or of
accuseds for that matter, is being considered, the court should seek the
consent of both the accused and the prosecution.  If consent is withheld, the
reasons should be explored.  Whether the accused consents or not, joinder
should only occur when, in the opinion of the court, it is in the interests of
justice and the offences or accuseds could initially have been jointly charged.

 

                   I would adopt the
American federal Rules of Criminal Procedure formulation, which is as
follows:

 

                   The
court may order two or more indictments or informations or both to be tried
together if the offenses, and the defendants if there is more than one, could
have been joined in a single indictment or information.  The procedure shall be
the same as if the prosecution were under such single indictment or
information.

 

I would also add, quoting from the Law
Reform Commission's Working Paper 55, at p. 39, the following:

 

...
any particular aspects of the rule in favour of severance would have to be
inapplicable in order for this judicial joinder to occur.  This rule would thus
reflect the rule for unsuccessful severance on a joint charge.

 

Issue No. 3

 

                   This now takes us
to the next issue, which is whether, given the difference in procedure, this
can be done between charges for summary convictions and charges for indictable
offences. 

 

                   Khan, supra, which was heard and
decided in 1984, is a case where that issue arises.  Indeed, two informations
were jointly heard, one setting out an indictable offence and the other a
summary conviction.  Khan, it will be recalled, was decided on the basis
of Phillips, which stood as a bar to holding joint trials of separate
informations whether these informations contained a mix of indictable alone,
summary alone, or a mix of summary and indictable.

 

                   Applying Phillips,
there was no need to address the issue as regards the law as it stood in 1985. 
Indeed, former s. 520(1)  of the Criminal Code  (now s. 591(1) ) permitted
joinder of any number of indictable offences in an indictment.  No mention was
made as regards joining either summary conviction offences together or joining
summary conviction offences with indictable offences.

 

                   This section was
substantially amended in 1985 (Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1985, S.C.
1985, c. 19, s. 119), to the effect that any number of counts for any number of
offences may be joined in the same indictment.  I am of the view that the 1985
amendment took away any impediment that might have existed prior to 1985 as
regards coupling summary convictions and indictable offences.  Therefore, if
one can include, in one indictment, summary conviction offences and indictable
offences, one should for the reasons I have given previously, be able to
proceed jointly when these offences are contained in two distinct
informations.  Also, it must be noted that s. 795  of the Criminal Code 
states that s. 591(1)  is applicable to summary conviction proceedings.  There
is nothing wrong with so doing.  We must nevertheless keep in mind the
difference of the process as regards indictable offences and summary
convictions.  It is obvious that the fact that indictable offences must on some
occasions, and may in others, be tried by a judge and a jury, is an impediment
to proceeding jointly when before that court with a summary conviction.

 

                   Secondly, the fact
that preliminary inquiries are available for most indictable offences is
another impediment for the joinder of trials.  I would, therefore, adopting the
suggestion of the Law Reform Commission in its Working Paper, at p. 39, state
the following:

 

...
summary conviction offences should be joined with indictable offences only
where the accused has waived the right to be tried in a higher court (either
with or without a jury) and has also foregone his right to a preliminary
hearing.  In other words, joinder may occur only where trial on the indictable
offence is to take place before the provincial court.

 

This will occur only when on the
indictable offence the accused either will have chosen a trial by provincial
court judge under Part XIX or, having chosen a trial by judge under Part XIX,
has waived his preliminary.  As suggested by the Law Reform Commission, in the
event of any conflict as to the applicable procedure, indictable offence
procedures should apply and crimes triable by jury may be joined with those
carrying no right to a jury trial (or preliminary inquiry) provided the accused
has consented to the trial of both matters in a forum without a jury and
without a preliminary inquiry.  

 

                   I find support in
taking this direction from a resolution passed by the Uniform Law Conference of
Canada (which is composed of all Deputy Ministers of Justice or Deputy
Attorneys General, representatives of the Canadian Bar, and other parties
appended to the justice system), in August of 1988 in the course of their
proceedings of the 70th annual meeting of that body.  It was resolved that the Criminal
Code  be amended to allow for the joinder of summary convictions and
indictable offences, with the indictable procedure to then apply.

 

                   There remains the
problem of appeals.  Of course, in cases where an issue common to both
informations has gone to the Summary Conviction Appeal Court and the Court of
Appeal, common sense would dictate that the Summary Conviction Appeal Court of
should await decision by the higher court.

 

Issue No. 4

 

                   The final question
is whether, in this case, proceeding jointly constituted a procedural
irregularity.  Obviously, no.  There is no suggestion on the part of the
appellant that there was, understandably so since it was at the appellant's own
suggestion that both informations were tried at the same time.

 

Disposition

 

                   For all of these
reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

                   Appellant was
charged with mischief to property.  The Crown sought to introduce evidence of
his whereabouts obtained through the use of an electronic tracking device (a
""beeper"") installed in his car.  The police had had appellant under
surveillance for some time since they suspected him of involvement in a recent
murder believed to be linked to a series of similar killings.  On July 14,
1987, they had obtained a warrant to search his home and vehicle, but had found
nothing to link him to any of the homicides.  The police had towed the car to
the police station to carry out the search.  While it was there, but after the
warrant had expired, they installed the beeper.  On August 15, the day of the
alleged offence, the police had been able to trace the location of appellant's
car using the beeper and established surveillance on a vehicle resembling his
parked in a driveway.  About two hours later, the police heard a loud crashing
sound, caused by the felling of a communications tower.  Soon after, they
observed another vehicle, which was in fact appellant's, pull out of a laneway
in a nearby field.  On August 26 the police obtained a warrant to search
appellant's vehicle.  When the car was vacuumed, melted pieces of metal,
consistent with the metal guy wires of the communications tower, were found. 
The constant electronic surveillance was maintained until mid-November, when
appellant was arrested on the mischief charge.  The trial judge excluded all
evidence obtained through the use of the beeper, on the ground that it had been
obtained in violation of appellant's right to be secure against unreasonable
search and seizure under s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms .  He acquitted appellant.  The Court of Appeal set aside the
acquittal and ordered a new trial.

 

                   Held (La Forest, Sopinka and Iacobucci JJ.
dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Gonthier, Cory and
Stevenson JJ.:  The installation of the beeper inside the appellant's vehicle
constituted an unreasonable search in violation of s. 8  of the Charter . 
Since the subsequent monitoring of the vehicle invaded a reasonable expectation
of privacy, it also constituted a search, and, in the absence of prior
authorization, violated s. 8 .  The search was only minimally intrusive,
however.  The expectation of privacy in a motor vehicle is much less than in
one's home or office.  As well, the device used was unsophisticated and
inaccurate.  It was a very rudimentary extension of physical surveillance, and
was attached to the appellant's vehicle, not to the appellant.  The police also
had a bona fide belief that they were protecting the public when the device was
installed, in view of the series of homicides in the rural area in which the
appellant lived.

 

                   The admission of
the evidence in this case would not bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.  The evidence as to the location of the car would not affect the
fairness of the trial.  This evidence was real, not conscriptive.  There was no
police compulsion or enticement which required appellant to enter or drive his
car.  The beeper merely helped the police to gather evidence which, to a great
extent, they had obtained by visually observing the vehicle.  The police also
acted in good faith in this case.  They had reasonable and probable grounds for
searching appellant's vehicle when they installed the beeper.  While the
prolonged electronic monitoring after the metal filings were discovered is
difficult to justify, the police obtained the evidence as to the location of
the vehicle within a 30‑day period, and this was not an unreasonable
length of time to maintain surveillance, particularly in light of their
obligation to protect the community from the suspected serial killer.  There
was clearly a pervasive threat of violence and a sense of urgency here. 
Moreover, the offence in this case is a serious one.  The evidence pertaining
to the metal pieces should also be admitted, for the same reasons.

 

                   Per Sopinka and Iacobucci JJ.
(dissenting):  The installation of the tracking device in appellant's
automobile constituted an unreasonable search in violation of s. 8  of the Charter . 
It is not necessary to consider whether the surveillance itself would violate
s. 8 .  The admission of the evidence would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.  The police knowingly committed an illegal trespass. 
While they suspected appellant of a serious offence, mere suspicion cannot be
used to redeem Charter  violations.  There is no appreciable distinction
between this case and R. v. Kokesch, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 3.

 

                   Per La Forest J. (dissenting):  The
installation of the tracking device in appellant's car constituted an unlawful
trespass and violates his privacy rights under s. 8  of the Charter . 
The use of the device to monitor his movements also violated s. 8 .  An
individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy not only in the communications
he makes, but in his movements as well, even when travelling on a public road. 
This is not a case where the police are monitoring the roads for the purpose of
regulating or observing what goes on there.  It is a case of tracking the
movements of an individual.  There is an important difference between courting
the risk that our activities may be observed by other persons and the risk that
agents of the state, in the absence of prior authorization, will track our
every move.  It is constitutionally unacceptable that the state should be
allowed to rest a justification for the unauthorized electronic surveillance of
a given person on the mere fact that that person had been in a situation where
he could be the object of scrutiny on the part of private individuals.  Whether
a person whose movements were surreptitiously tracked had a reasonable
expectation of privacy in given circumstances must not be made to depend on the
degree to which that person took measures to shield his or her activities from
the scrutiny of other persons.

 

                   The grave threat to
individual privacy posed by surreptitious electronic tracking of one's movement
is such as to require prior judicial authorization.  The issuance of a search
warrant will ordinarily call for an objective showing of reasonable and
probable cause, and this should generally be required of those seeking to
employ electronic tracking devices in the pursuit of an individual.  Since this
means of surveillance, if properly controlled, is somewhat less intrusive than
electronic audio or video surveillance, it may be possible to establish that
judicial officers should be empowered in certain circumstances to accept a
somewhat lower standard, such as a ""solid ground"" for suspicion, if
it can be established that such a power is necessary for the control of certain
types of dangerous or pernicious crimes.

 

                   The evidence
obtained through the use of the tracking device should be excluded under
s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  Such evidence would not have existed
without the device because visual contact had been lost.  Since the violation
in this case was intrusive and long‑lasting, it was serious.  The
electronic surveillance continued day and night over many months.  The
violation was not mitigated by good faith on the part of the police.  The
police certainly knew they needed a warrant to search the car, and that the
warrant they had obtained did not permit what they did, and in fact had
expired.  The police did not have reasonable and probable cause, but were
acting on mere suspicion.  The long‑term consequences of admitting
evidence obtained in such circumstances on the integrity of our justice system
outweigh the harm done by this accused being acquitted.

//Cory J.//

 

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and Gonthier, Cory and Stevenson JJ. was delivered by

 

                   Cory
J. -- I have read with
great interest the compelling reasons of my colleague
Justice La Forest but, with respect, I must differ from the
conclusions that he has reached.

 

Issues

 

                   The Crown
respondent conceded that the installation of the beeper was an unreasonable
search in violation of s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
Accepting this concession, the main issue is whether the evidence obtained as a
result of the unreasonable search should be excluded under s. 24(2)  of the
Charter .  However, the evidence in question stems not only from the
installation of the beeper but also from the monitoring by the beeper.  Prior
to the s. 24(2)  analysis, the following preliminary issue arises:

 

Did
the use of the beeper constitute an unreasonable search in violation of
s. 8  of the Charter ?

 

Analysis

 

1.Did
the Beeper Monitoring of the Vehicle Constitute an Unreasonable Search for the
Purposes of s. 8 ?

 

                   (a)Introduction

 

                   It is clear that
s. 8  of the Charter  guarantees a broad and general right to be
secure from unreasonable search where the person who is the object of the
search has a reasonable expectation of privacy.  In determining whether the
beeper monitoring constitutes a search, the initial question is whether there
is a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of the monitored activity. 
If the police activity invades a reasonable expectation of privacy, then the
activity is a search.

 

                   (b)The
Lesser Expectation of Privacy in a Motor Vehicle

 

                   The expectation of
privacy in a vehicle cannot be as great as that contended by my colleague.  For
the safety and well-being of society, motor vehicles and their drivers are
subject to a great many statutory requirements, conditions and regulations. 
Almost every aspect of the use of a motor vehicle is controlled.  The side of
the road on which a car may be driven; the speed at which it may proceed; when
it may overtake and where it may overtake another vehicle; where and when it
must stop; the mechanical condition of the vehicle; the installation of certain
accessories, be they required or prohibited; the places where a vehicle may
park: all these and many more are circumscribed by various Acts and
regulations.

 

                   For the safety of
all, it is essential that drivers be tested before receiving their licence;
that RIDE programs be instituted to discourage the drinking driver; that the
speed of vehicles be supervised and that the mechanical fitness of vehicles be
inspected.  These inspections and tests and this supervision do not constitute
unreasonable breaches of basic civil liberties.  Rather, they are common sense
rules that exist for the protection of society as a whole.  Reasonable
surveillance and supervision of vehicles and their drivers are essential.  Without
them, motor vehicles inevitably become instruments of crippling injury, death
and destruction.

 

                   Society then
requires and expects protection from drunken drivers, speeding drivers and
dangerous drivers.  A reasonable level of surveillance of each and every motor
vehicle is readily accepted, indeed demanded, by society to obtain this
protection.  All this is set out to emphasize that, although there remains an
expectation of privacy in automobile travel, it is markedly decreased relative
to the expectation of privacy in one's home or office.

 

                   (c)The
Nature of the Device Utilized in this Case and its Minimal Intrusion

 

                   It must be
remembered that the tracking device used in this case was unsophisticated and
indeed simplistic.  It did not provide a visual record of the movement or
position of the vehicle.  Nor was it able to pick up and record conversations
in the vehicle.  Rather, it was capable of giving only a very rough idea of the
vehicle's location.  Certainly, it could not be said that the device was
capable of tracking the location of a vehicle at all times.  

 

                   The device
consisted of a low power radio transmitter.  From the strength of the signal,
it was possible to determine the general location of the object to which the
beeper had been fixed.  By moving in the direction of the transmitter and
adjusting the ""RF gain control"", the location could be more precisely
determined.  The device used in this case was not capable of indicating if the
object being tracked was to the right, left, front or back of the receiver of
the signal.

 

                   The evidence in
this case was that the device was used intermittently as a back-up for visual
surveillance of the appellant's car beginning on July 17, 1987, particularly to
attempt to locate the vehicle when visual surveillance failed.  Since the
device was not capable of pinpointing the vehicle with any degree of precision,
physical surveillance was always required to fix its proximate position.

 

                   Indeed, on the
night the tower was destroyed, the device was not capable of successfully
tracking the appellant's vehicle.  That night, the police lost visual contact
with the appellant's vehicle and attempted to trace its location using the
beeper.  With the ""help"" of the beeper, the police established
surveillance on a car resembling the appellant's.  While they were busy
observing this vehicle that was not, in fact, the appellant's, they heard the
crashing of the Bell tower and then visually observed the appellant's
actual vehicle leave a nearby field.  This incident illustrates the
unsophisticated and inaccurate nature of the beeper.

 

                   It has been seen
that there is a reduced expectation of privacy by those using a motor vehicle. 
In addition, the intrusion on any remaining expectation of privacy as a result
of the device used in this case is minimal.  This particular beeper was a very
rudimentary extension of physical surveillance.  It must be remembered as well
that the device was attached to the appellant's vehicle, not to the appellant. 
How very different a device such as this is, in its operation and in its effect
on the individual, from a hidden video camera or an electronic monitor that surreptitiously
intercepts private communications.

 

                   Before considering
what the position with regard to vehicle tracking devices should be in Canada,
it may be of interest to see what approach the Supreme Court of the United
States has taken.  This should not be considered an indication that American
decisions should be slavishly followed.  Rather, they should be considered for
the sake of their learning and to see if they might be helpful to our
consideration.

 

                   (d)The
American Approach

 

                   In the United States,
it has been held that beeper monitoring of a vehicle on a public roadway is
neither a ""search"" nor a ""seizure"" for the purposes of the
Fourth Amendment because it does not violate any legitimate expectation of
privacy.  In United States v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276 (1983), the Supreme
Court held (at pp. 281-82):

 

                   A
person traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable
expectation of privacy in his movements from one place to another.  When [the
courier] traveled over the public streets he voluntarily conveyed to anyone who
wanted to look the fact that he was traveling over particular roads in a
particular direction, the fact of whatever stops he made, and the fact of his
final destination when he exited from public roads onto private property. 

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   Visual
surveillance from public places along [the courier's] route or adjoining [the
accused's] premises would have sufficed to reveal all of these facts to the
police.  The fact that the officers in this case relied not only on visual
surveillance, but also on the use of the beeper to signal the presence of [the
courier's] automobile to the police receiver, does not alter the situation. 

 

                   It is true there
has been some criticism of this decision:  first, on the ground that it assumes
an equivalence between visual surveillance and scientific enhancement of
surveillance; and second, that it fails to recognize the existence of the
privacy interest in automobile travel.  Nonetheless, the decision is a strong
indication that there must be, at the very least, a markedly lesser expectation
of privacy by the users of motor vehicles.

 

                   (e)The
Protection of the Public 

 

                   The factual
background to this case is of importance.  It establishes that the police had a
bona fide belief that they were protecting the public when the beeper was
installed.  There had been a series of homicides in the rural area in which the
appellant lived.  He was a suspect in these events.  The homicides were as
follows:

 

1)Sept.
24, 1975 -Lillian Rouson died in a farmhouse fire near Morrisburg,

 

2)Jan.
8, 1981 -Kenneth Murphy died in a farmhouse fire in Finch Township,

 

3)Nov.
18, 1983 -Archie Collision died in a fire in his log cabin near Kempenfeldt,

 

4)Nov.
25, 1983 -Harold Davidson was shot to death in his farmhouse kitchen near
Brinston,

 

5)May
16 or 17, 1987 -Keith Johnston was killed by a shot from a high powered rifle
in a farmhouse near Monkland,

 

6)July
14, 1987 -John King was apparently shot to death before his home was set on
fire in Moorewood.

 

                   It can be seen that
the four most recent murders took place over a four-year period, the last two
occurring within two months of each other.  In addition to the homicides, the
police had received a tape of an anonymous telephone call threatening more
killings.  They believed that the call came from the appellant.  The appellant
was the prime suspect in the killings of Keith Johnston and John King.

 

                   The police were
able to satisfy a justice of the peace that there were reasonable and probable
grounds to obtain a warrant to search the appellant's home, the outbuildings
surrounding his home and his vehicle.  Between 5:30 p.m. on July 14
and 7:30 a.m. on July 15, 1987, the warrant relating to the murder
investigation was executed.  The appellant's vehicle was towed to the Winchester
Provincial Police Detachment, so that it could be examined by the
identification unit.  The vehicle remained at this detachment until
July 16.  During this time, arrangements were made to have the tracking
device installed in the back seat.  In light of this background, the police had
every reason to believe that in installing the device they were not only
investigating two murder cases, but also were acting to protect the residents
of this rural community.

 

                   (f)The
Nature of the Search in this Case

 

                   In this case, it has
been fairly conceded that the installation of the beeper in the interior of the
motor vehicle constituted a search which breached the provisions of s. 8  of the
Charter .  Since the beeper monitoring of the appellant's vehicle invaded
a reasonable expectation of privacy, this police activity also constituted a
search.  Absent prior authorization, such a search will be prima facie
unreasonable and therefore in violation of s. 8 .  As there was no prior
authorization for the installation and use of the beeper device, the monitoring
violated the appellant's s. 8  right to be free from unreasonable search.  At
the same time, however, the lessened privacy interest combined with the use of
an unsophisticated device establish that the search was only minimally intrusive. 
This minimal intrusion and the urgent need to protect the community provide the
context in which the s. 24(2)  analysis should be made. 

 

                   Furthermore, it
seems artificial to distinguish between the installation of the beeper and the
subsequent monitoring.  The monitoring is the extension of the installation. 
It is the aim and object of the installation and cannot be divided from the
latter.  The installation of the device and its subsequent use to monitor the
vehicle, together, constituted the unreasonable search.  It is therefore
necessary, in the context of the unreasonable search as a whole, to determine
whether the evidence obtained should nonetheless be admitted.

 

2. Should the Evidence be Admitted?

 

                   Section 24(2)  of
the Charter  reads as follows:

 

                   24. . . .

                   (2)
Where, in proceedings under subsection (1), a court concludes that evidence was
obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed
by this Charter , the evidence shall be excluded if it is established that,
having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings
would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 

 

                   It must be
remembered that this Court has a limited role in reviewing the decisions of
provincial appellate courts in respect to s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  In
R. v. Greffe, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 755, Lamer J. (as he then was), at
p. 783, wrote:

 

I
note that it is not the proper function of this Court, absent some apparent
error as to the applicable principles or rules of law, or absent a finding that
is unreasonable, to review findings of courts below in respect of s. 24(2)  of
the  Charter  and substitute its opinion for that arrived at by the Court
of Appeal. . . .

 

                   Thus, it is only if
the Court of Appeal made an unreasonable finding or applied the wrong
principles that it would be appropriate to undertake a review.  

 

                   What then are the
principles that should be considered?  They are set out in R. v. Collins,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 265.  There, Lamer J., as he then was, divided the
factors that should be taken into account when considering the admissibility of
evidence under s. 24(2)  into three groups:

 

(1)
the effect of admission on the fairness of the trial process;

 

(2)
the seriousness of the violation; and

 

(3)
the effect of exclusion on the reputation of the administration of justice.

 

It was emphasized that the object of
s. 24(2)  was not to remedy police misconduct, but rather to prevent the
administration of justice being brought into further disrepute through the
admission of improperly obtained evidence.  These factors will have to be
applied to two aspects of the evidence, namely, the location of the appellant's
car and the metal pieces found in the vehicle which were similar to the metal
guy wires of the destroyed tower.  

 

Evidence Obtained as to the Movement
of the Car

 

I. Factors Affecting the Fairness
of the Trial

 

                   The fairness of the
trial process has been described as a critical factor.  In determining
fairness, the nature of the evidence obtained must be considered.  The
admission of real evidence obtained as a result of a Charter  violation
will rarely result in a finding of unfairness.  However, the admission of
evidence obtained by conscripting the accused against himself, such as a
confession, will generally render the trial unfair.  In Collins, supra,
Lamer J. at pp. 284-85 wrote:

 

                   It
is clear to me that the factors relevant to this determination will include the
nature of the evidence obtained as a result of the violation and the nature of
the right violated and not so much the manner in which the right was violated. 
Real evidence that was obtained in a manner that violated the Charter 
will rarely operate unfairly for that reason alone.  The real evidence existed
irrespective of the violation of the Charter  and its use does not render
the trial unfair.  However, the situation is very different with respect to
cases where, after a violation of the Charter , the accused is
conscripted against himself through a confession or other evidence emanating
from him.  The use of such evidence would render the trial unfair, for it did
not exist prior to the violation and it strikes at one of the fundamental tenets
of a fair trial, the right against self-incrimination.  Such evidence will
generally arise in the context of an infringement of the right to counsel.  Our
decisions in Therens, supra, and Clarkson v. The Queen,
[1986] 1 S.C.R. 383, are illustrative of this.  The use of
self-incriminating evidence obtained following a denial of the right of counsel
will generally go to the very fairness of the trial and should generally be
excluded.

 

The
Nature of the Evidence:  Is it Real or Conscriptive?

 

                   How should the
evidence as to the location of the appellant's vehicle be considered?  Evidence
has been found to be ""real"" when it referred to tangible items.  For
example narcotics were held to be real evidence in R. v. Jacoy, [1988]
2 S.C.R. 548, and in R. v. Debot, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140.  Weapons
were held to be real evidence in R. v. Black, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 138. 
In all of these cases, the real or tangible evidence was admitted even though
it had been obtained as a result of an unreasonable search.  

 

                   On the other hand,
""conscriptive"" evidence usually refers to evidence which emanates
from the accused following a violation of s. 10 (b) of the Charter . 
Samples of blood taken from the accused were found to be conscriptive evidence
in R. v. Pohoretsky, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 945.  Statements made by the
accused were found to be conscriptive in R. v. Manninen, [1987] 1
S.C.R. 1233.  The compulsory appearance in a police line-up was held to
constitute conscriptive evidence in R. v. Ross, [1989]
1 S.C.R. 3.  There at p. 16 it was said:

 

. .
. the use of any evidence that could not have been obtained but for the
participation of the accused in the construction of the evidence for the
purposes of the trial would tend to render the trial process unfair.

 

                   In this case, I
agree with the Court of Appeal that the movements of the car constituted real
evidence.  There was no police compulsion or enticement which required the
appellant to enter or drive his car.  Rather he exercised his own free will. 
It was the accused who determined that he would drive his car, the routes he
would follow and the manner in which he drove.  The movement of an object may
be transitory but it is real.  The movement of a terrestrial body can be and
often is plotted.  That movement is transitory but real.  The migratory route
of the caribou herds is transitory but it is vital and real to those who depend
upon that movement for food and clothing.  So too is the movement of a motor
vehicle real.  This evidence could be considered conscriptive if the actions of
the police forced or perhaps enticed the accused to utilize his vehicle and to
follow prefixed routes in arriving at destinations selected by them. 

 

                   It has been
conceded that visual surveillance of motor vehicles by the police is
permissible.  Further, there is agreement that visual surveillance may properly
be augmented by the use of binoculars.  The use of this particular beeper,
similarly, simply augments visual surveillance.  The installation and use of
the beeper did not affect in any way the movement of the car.  It simply
enhanced the ability of the police to observe its movements. 

                   In Thomson
Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive
Trade Practices Commission), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425, La Forest J.
found there was a clear distinction between evidence which an accused was
forced to create, which should not be admissible, and existing evidence, which
the accused had merely been forced to locate or identify, which should be
admitted.  He put forth his position at pp. 552-553:

 

                   I
would first of all note that I do not believe that in drawing this distinction,
Lamer J. intended to draw a hard and fast line between real evidence
obtained in breach of the Charter  and all other types of evidence that
could be so obtained. . . . I think this clearly indicates that
what Lamer J. had in mind was the much broader distinction between evidence
which the accused has been forced to create, and evidence which he or
she has been forced to merely locate or identify. . . .

 

A
breach of the Charter  that forces the eventual accused to create
evidence necessarily has the effect of providing the Crown with evidence it
would not otherwise have had.  It follows that the strength of its case against
the accused is necessarily enhanced as a result of the breach.  This is the
very kind of prejudice that the right against self-incrimination, as well as
rights such as that to counsel, are intended to prevent.  In contrast, where
the effect of a breach of the Charter  is merely to locate or identify
already existing evidence, the case of the ultimate strength of the Crown's
case is not necessarily strengthened in this way.  The fact that the evidence
already existed means that it could have been discovered anyway.  Where this is
the case, the accused is not forced to confront any evidence at trial that he
would not have been forced to confront if his Charter  rights had been
respected.  In such circumstances, it would be the exclusion rather than the
admission of evidence that would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.

 

and at p. 555:

 

                   The
one qualification that must be made to the above has to do with the difference
between independently existing evidence that could have been found
without compelled testimony, and independently existing evidence that would
have been found without compelled testimony.  As I have acknowledged at several
points in these reasons, there will be situations where derivative evidence is
so concealed or inaccessible as to be virtually undiscoverable without the
assistance of the wrongdoer.  For practical purposes, the subsequent use of
such evidence would be indistinguishable from the subsequent use of the
pre-trial compelled testimony. [Emphasis in original.] 

 

                   There my colleague indicated
that ""created"" evidence would affect the fairness of the trial and
should not be admitted while ""located"" evidence would only affect the
fairness of the trial if the evidence were virtually undiscoverable without the
assistance of the accused.  

 

                   In this case, the
use of the beeper merely assisted the police to gather evidence which, to a
great extent, they had obtained by visually observing the vehicle.  It is
difficult to determine from the transcript what evidence was obtained from the
beeper and what was obtained from observation. In light of the unsophisticated
nature of the beeper, it seems that the essential evidence was obtained by
direct observation.  In any event, evidence as to movement of the vehicle was
certainly not ""undiscoverable"".  It follows that the admission of the
evidence as to the location of the car could not be said to affect the fairness
of the trial.

 

II. The Factors Affecting the
Seriousness of the Violation

 

                   In this case, I
have concluded that the admission of the evidence would not affect the fairness
of the trial.  How then should the violation be assessed?  Lamer J. in Collins,
supra, at p. 285 quoted the following passage from
Le Dain J.'s reasons in R. v. Therens, [1985]
1 S.C.R. 613, at p. 652:

 

The
relative seriousness of the constitutional violation has been assessed in the
light of whether it was committed in good faith, or was inadvertent or of a
merely technical nature, or whether it was deliberate, wilful or flagrant. 
Another relevant consideration is whether the action which constituted the
constitutional violation was motivated by urgency or necessity to prevent the
loss or destruction of the evidence.

 

                   Were the police
actions in this case undertaken in bad faith or were they wilful and flagrant
violations of Charter  rights?

 

                   (a)Good
Faith

 

                   Bad faith has been
found in situations where there has been a blatant disregard for the Charter 
rights of an accused or where more than one Charter  right has been
violated (see R. v. Greffe, supra, and R. v. Genest,
[1989] 1 S.C.R. 59).  Good faith has been established in situations
where the violation stemmed from police reliance upon a statute or from the
following of a procedure which was later found to infringe the Charter 
(see R. v. Duarte, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30, and R. v. Simmons,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 495).

 

                   The Court of Appeal
found that the police acted in good faith.  I agree with that conclusion.  The
police had been successful in obtaining a warrant to search the appellant's
home, outbuildings and car.  It can therefore be assumed that they had
reasonable and probable grounds for searching the vehicle of the appellant. 
These reasonable and probable grounds do not disappear simply because the
police were not able to find evidence within a short period of time. 

 

                   The police did
retain the car and install the beeper after the warrant had expired.  The
officer who installed the device testified that he did not realize the warrant
had expired the day before the installation.  Although this evidence indicates
carelessness on the part of the police, it does not demonstrate bad faith.  Of
greater concern is the length of time of the surveillance assisted by the
beeper.  Although the communications tower was destroyed on August 15 and
the metal fillings were discovered on August 27, the constant electronic
surveillance was maintained until mid-November when the accused was arrested on
the charge of mischief.  There can be no doubt that the police had a responsibility
to the community to carefully investigate the murders.  Yet the prolonged
electronic monitoring after August 27 is difficult to justify.  Nonetheless,
the police did obtain the evidence as to the location of the vehicle within a
30-day period from the beginning of the electronic monitoring, a time when the
police had established grounds for the search.  This was not, in the
circumstances, an unreasonable length of time to maintain surveillance,
particularly in light of the obligation of the police to protect the small
community from the suspected serial killer.

 

                   (b)The
Threat of Violence and Urgency

 

                   In the case at bar
there clearly existed a pervasive threat of violence and a sense of urgency. 
The relatively small rural community in which the accused resided had
experienced a series of unsolved homicides.  The accused had been a suspect in
these crimes and indeed a prime suspect in at least two of the homicides. 
Evidence existed which linked the appellant to the murders.  There had been an
anonymous phone call threatening more killings.  The police suspected this call
came from the appellant.  The accused had a significant criminal record
including convictions for robbery, break and enter, theft and possession of
offensive weapons.  These factors must have motivated the police in undertaking
and continuing the surveillance of the accused.  It was the duty of the police
to investigate the crimes and to protect the community.

 

                   In the
circumstances, the police would have been remiss in their duties if they had
not observed the movements of the appellant.  It is easy to imagine the sense
of outrage and the criticism that would flow from the community if there had
not been police surveillance of the appellant.

 

                   The question then
becomes: how was that surveillance to be accomplished?  All agree that it was
quite proper for the police to physically observe the appellant and his car at
all hours of the day and night.  It is further agreed that these physical
observations could be enhanced by the use of binoculars.  Yet, it is said that
the installation of this rudimentary tracking device the day after the search
warrant expired and the subsequent monitoring goes too far and prohibits the
admission of the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) .  This I find to be a somewhat
anomalous position.  

 

                   In my view the
actions of the police in this case were not such that they could be termed
""actions taken in bad faith"".  There was no physical violence, force,
coercion or threat employed.  The carelessness, with regard to the expiry date
of the warrant and the lengthy continuation of the surveillance, do not, in the
circumstances of this case, justify the exclusion of the evidence.  

 

                   Nor do I think that
this conclusion conflicts with principles laid down in R. v. Kokesch,
[1990] 3 S.C.R. 3.  In that case, the police searched the yard
surrounding the accused's home without a warrant and without the existence of
any reasonable and probable grounds upon which they could have obtained a
search warrant.  There it was held that the narcotics found during the
subsequent valid search of the house should be excluded.  It was determined
that where the police have nothing but suspicion and no legal way to obtain other
evidence they should leave the suspect alone.  

 

                   Here the situation
was very different.  It must be remembered that the police did have reasonable
and probable grounds to search the appellant's vehicle when they installed the
beeper.  Moreover, there was a real threat of urgency flowing from the two most
recent homicides in the community coupled with the telephone threat of further
murders which motivated police action.  More importantly, the invasion of
privacy was not of a home or office but of a motor vehicle. 

 

III. The Effect of Exclusion

 

                   In Collins, supra,
Lamer J. observed that if evidence is excluded because of a trivial violation,
particularly where the charge is very serious, the administration of justice
may suffer greater disrepute than if the evidence were admitted.  He went on to
observe that if the admission of evidence renders the trial unfair, then, no
matter how serious the offence, the evidence must be excluded. 

 

                   The charge in this
case does not appear to be extremely grave.  But when it is recalled that the
destruction of the tower caused damage in excess of one million dollars, it can
be seen that the offence is very serious.  The s. 8  violation in respect
of the accused's car, although not trivial, was certainly less severe than
would be a violation of the s. 10 (b) right to counsel or a search of a
person, home or office.  Taking into account the nature of the charge and the
nature of the Charter  breach, I am of the view that the admission of the
evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  

 

Metal Pieces

 

                   The surveillance of
the vehicle of the appellant, both electronically and visually by the police,
provided them with the necessary grounds to obtain a second warrant to search
the appellant's car.  As a result of that search, the police discovered the
metal pieces that were similar to those found on the guy wires of the tower. 
The information obtained from that search emanated from information obtained as
a result of the initial Charter  violation which occurred when the beeper
was installed.  As a result, the evidence obtained from the second search is
linked to the original Charter  breach.  Its admissibility will be
determined by a review of the same factors and principles that were considered
in determining the admissibility of the evidence as to the movements of the
vehicle.  It follows that this evidence too is admissible.  If anything, the
metal filings can be said to be more ""real"" than the movements of the
vehicle.  Once again the admission of the evidence would not affect the
fairness of the trial procedure.  Nor is the violation so serious that it, in
itself, would warrant the exclusion of the evidence.  In all the circumstances,
the evidence pertaining to the metal pieces should be admitted as should the
evidence pertaining to the movements of the appellant's vehicle.  

 

Summary

 

                   In summary, the
installation of the electronic tracking device inside the vehicle after the
expiry of the warrant and the subsequent monitoring of the movements of that
vehicle constituted an unreasonable search in violation of s. 8  of the Charter . 
However, the evidence as to the location of the appellant's motor vehicle and
the evidence of the metal pieces found in his car are admissible pursuant to s.
24(2)  of the Charter . 

 

Future Legislation

 

                   I agree with my
colleague that it would be preferable if the installation of tracking devices
and the subsequent monitoring of vehicles were controlled by legislation.  I
would also agree that this is a less intrusive means of surveillance than
electronic audio or video surveillance.  Accordingly, a lower standard such as
a ""solid ground"" for suspicion would be a basis for obtaining an
authorization from an independent authority, such as a justice of the peace, to
install a device and monitor the movements of a vehicle.

 

Disposition

 

                   In the result, I
would dismiss the appeal.  

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

//La Forest J.//

 

                   La
Forest J. (dissenting) --
This appeal raises the general question of whether, and in what circumstances,
the installation by the police without authorization of an electronic tracking
device in a private citizen's automobile and its use as a means of
surreptitious electronic surveillance to monitor the whereabouts of the citizen
violate s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , which
protects the individual against unreasonable searches and seizures.  It also
raises the question whether evidence so obtained should be rejected under s.
24(2)  of the Charter  because it could bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.

 

Facts

 

                   The appellant was
charged with mischief to property contrary to s. 387(3) (now s. 430(3)) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  In attempting to establish this offence, the
Crown sought to introduce evidence of the whereabouts of the appellant obtained
through the use of an electronic tracking device (a ""beeper"")
installed in his car.  A beeper may be described as a radio transmitter,
usually battery operated, which emits periodic signals that can be picked up by
a radio receiver.  The background and manner of installation may briefly be
summarized as follows.

 

                   The appellant had
for some time been under surveillance by the Ontario Provincial Police (the
O.P.P.) who suspected him of involvement in a recent murder in Morewood, Ontario
which they believed to be linked to a series of similar killings in the area. 
In the course of its homicide investigation, the O.P.P. on July 14, 1987
applied for a warrant to search the appellant's home and vehicle on the
following grounds:  that the police had spotted the appellant driving his
automobile towards his home shortly after the murder; that they had observed,
in the back seat of his car, a pair of binoculars, a pair of work gloves, and a
plastic rain coat, which appeared used; that they had observed under the car
soil and vegetation (Timothy, a plant common to the area) similar to that found
on the victim's property; that the appellant's voice sounded similar to that on
a tape of someone who purported to be the murderer, though the voice appeared
disguised and could not be positively identified; that the appellant had been a
suspect in certain of the previous homicides; and that he had an extensive
criminal record for break and enter, robbery, theft, and offences relating to
offensive weapons.  The police obtained the warrant and conducted the search
but found nothing in either the accused's home or vehicle to link him to any of
the homicides.

 

                   Pursuant to the
terms of the warrant, the police had towed the appellant's automobile to the police
station to carry out the search.  Some time later, more than thirty hours after
the expiration of the warrant, they installed an electronic tracking device in
the interior of the appellant's vehicle.  The ""beeper"" was
surreptitiously hidden in the foam in the back seat of the appellant's car,
causing minor damage to the seat.  This, the trial judge held, was done on the
basis of ""mere suspicion"" and it was, of course, done without
judicial authorization.  The car was then returned to the appellant.

 

                   The beeper emitted
a radio frequency transmission which could be detected by a police scanner for
a distance of up to three kilometres.  Though the device was rather
unsophisticated, and the person who installed it thought it was capable of
giving only its general location, he had not counted on the ingenuity of the
police who by listening to the tone and using an antenna held outside the
window of a police vehicle could be led in a specific direction.  Along with
constant visual surveillance, the device enabled the police to track the
appellant's whereabouts at all times of the day or night.  The trial judge
found that the police used the device on a constant basis for a period
extending over many months, and pertinently, over a month prior to the commission
of the offence alleged in the present case, both to track the vehicle in motion
and to pinpoint its location when stationary.

 

                   On August 15, 1987,
the day of the alleged offence, the police had lost visual contact with the
appellant's vehicle but were able to trace its location using the beeper.  Upon
moving to that location, the police established surveillance on a vehicle
resembling the appellant's that was parked in a driveway.  Approximately two
hours later, the police surveillance team heard a loud noise which sounded like
metal crashing.  The crashing sound was caused by the felling of a Bell Canada
communications tower, the value of which was in excess of $2 million.  Soon
after, the police observed another vehicle, which was in fact the appellant's
and appeared to be identical to the one they were watching, pull out of a
laneway in a nearby field from which the crashing sound had emanated.  The
second vehicle was later located at the appellant's residence.

 

                   On August 26, 1987,
the O.P.P. observed the appellant sitting in his car in a field, where he had
parked in an attempt to avoid the heavy police surveillance.  At this time, the
police conducted a warrantless search of the appellant's vehicle and person. 
Nothing was found.  Later that evening, the police obtained a warrant to search
the appellant's vehicle.  When the car was vacuumed, melted pieces of metal,
consistent with the metal guy wires of the Bell communications tower, were
discovered.  On November 13, 1987, the appellant was charged with mischief to
property over $1,000 with respect to the Bell tower.

 

                   The appellant
brought a pre-trial motion for exclusion of the evidence relating to his
whereabouts on August 15, 1987 on the ground that such evidence had been
obtained in violation of his rights under s. 8  of the Charter .  The
trial judge granted the appellant's motion and refused to admit any of the
evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of the use of the
electronic tracking device.  As a result, he acquitted the appellant.  The
Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal, set aside the acquittal and
ordered a new trial.

 

Judicial History

 

District Court of Ontario, September 26, 1988

 

                   The trial judge,
Smith Dist. Ct. J., made three separate rulings.  The first concerned the issue
of whether the installation and use of an electronic tracking device
constitutes a ""search"" for the purposes of s. 8  of the Charter . 
He held that it does, rejecting the Crown's arguments that a person, by
travelling upon a public highway, extends an open invitation to be observed,
and that the tracking device in this case was generally used only to facilitate
and assist visual surveillance.  He stated:

 

                   There
is then, from time to time at least, a reasonable expectation of privacy in the
use made of one's private automobile and when that expectation of privacy is
intruded upon by the police as it was here, then the police effectively made a
search of that vehicle not only by installing the device, but by tracking it
over the one month period between the time of its installation and the alleged
commission of the offence by the accused.

 

                   The trial judge
next considered the reasonableness of the search.  In finding that the police
had no reasonable and probable grounds for employing the monitoring device, the
trial judge held that the police's suspicion of the appellant in relation to
the homicides was never elevated to the point of their having any reason to
believe he was the killer.  Rather, he held, the police proceeded on the basis
of mere suspicion.  The trial judge interpreted the police's motives in
planting the tracking device in the appellant's car as an attempt ""to keep
track of his whereabouts and see if he was going to attempt any similar
action"".  He held that the Charter  prevents the police from
invading a person's privacy to see if they are going to do something illegal.

 

                   The trial judge
found the search represented by the installation and use of the monitoring
device to be an on-going and continuous one.  He disagreed with the Crown's
contention that the device was used simply as an aid to visual surveillance. 
Rather, he held, it was used as a tracking device and constituted ""an
on-going search conducted by the police for which they had no reasonable and
probable ground because they had nothing more than a suspicion of Wise as a
criminal"".  For these reasons, he found the installation and use of the
tracking device to be an unreasonable search and thus a violation of the
appellant's rights under s. 8  of the Charter .

 

                   The trial judge
then considered whether the evidence obtained through use of the monitoring
device should be excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  In finding
that admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute, he emphasized the serious and on-going nature of the Charter 
violation.  The unreasonable search, he observed, took place twenty-four hours
a day for over a month prior to the commission of the alleged offence.  He
found the violation to be deliberate and planned, and not to have been
committed in circumstances of urgency.  He also observed that because the
impugned evidence did not exist before the Charter  violation, the
accused had been compelled to produce evidence against himself.

 

                   In such
circumstances, the trial judge concluded, admission of the evidence would bring
the administration of justice into disrepute since it would deprive the accused
of a fair trial and would constitute judicial condonation of unacceptable
police conduct.  In reaching this conclusion, the trial judge emphasized that
the relevant standard is that of the reasonable person, dispassionate and fully
apprised of the circumstances, in a community where the current mood is
reasonable.  Such a person, he found, would hold the administration of justice
in disrepute if the impugned evidence were admitted.

 

                   Accordingly, the
trial judge held that all evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result
of the use of the electronic tracking device was to be excluded.  As a result,
he acquitted the appellant.

 

Ontario Court of Appeal (1990), 49 C.R.R. 163

 

                   On appeal, the
Crown conceded that the installation of the electronic monitoring device constituted
a breach of the appellant's s. 8  right.  Given this concession, the Court of
Appeal confined its reasons to the s. 24(2)  issue.  In considering the test of
admissibility as set out by this Court in R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R.
265, the Court of Appeal stated, at pp. 165-66:

 

The
evidence obtained may or may not be conclusive but there is no question that
without it there is no case against the accused.  We believe that while the
action of the police was deliberate, they proceeded in good faith having found
other investigatory techniques unproductive.  The populace in the area was
understandably very concerned about the rash of murders committed and it was
reasonable both for the investigation and the prevention of crime to track the
movements of the respondent in his car.  The device proved necessary to
maintain contact with that car.  We do not find the evidence obtained to be
conscriptive of the accused as referred to in the Collins case. 
Everything he did, everywhere he went, was of his own volition.  Also, the
evidence obtained must be classified as real, which as stated in Collins
is an important factor leading to admissibility.

 

                   For these reasons,
the court refused to find that admission of the evidence would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute.  Accordingly, it allowed the appeal,
set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial.

 

                   Notice of appeal to
this Court was then filed on behalf of the appellant.

 

Analysis

 

Application of s. 8  to the
Installation

 

                   I should at the
outset note that the Crown has conceded that the installation of the
tracking device in the appellant's car in the circumstances of this case
constituted a violation of s. 8 .  In my view, the Crown was right in making
this concession.  The violation resulted from a combination of facts:  the
device was installed in the interior of the car; minor damage (the displacement
of some of the foam in the seat cushion) was caused; and the installation was
not performed pursuant to a search warrant.  This installation constituted an
unlawful trespass.  In engaging in this activity, the police were carrying on
an unreasonable search.  The information obtained was a product of the illegal
search; it came into the state's possession by the exploitation of its wrong.

 

                   All of this is
fully supported by the recent decision of this Court in R. v. Kokesch,
[1990] 3 S.C.R. 3.  There police officers in the course of a narcotics
investigation conducted a perimeter search of a house without warrant and by
observing, listening and smelling were able to surmise what was going on in the
house.  The Court unanimously held that the police had no right to trespass on
the land adjoining the house and that they were engaged in an unreasonable
search.  A majority rejected evidence flowing from this search under s. 24(2) 
of the Charter .  The case, of course, dealt with the home, the principal
bulwark against the invasion of an individual's privacy, but other locations
closely related to one's life or affairs are also protected under s. 8 ; see,
for example, Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145; R. v. Moran
(1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 225; R. v. Wong, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 36.  While I am
prepared to acknowledge that, as compared to the home, the individual has a
diminished expectation of privacy in respect of his or her automobile,
nonetheless an automobile is so central to one's daily life that the interior
of the vehicle immediately jumps to mind as being an area meriting protection
against state intrusion; see in this context Cardwell v. Lewis, 417 U.S.
583 (1974), at p. 591.  In the present case, there were no exigent
circumstances, and the activities of the police were not authorized.  The
search warrant had expired and, for that matter, it did not authorize that kind
of search.

 

Application of s. 8  to the Monitoring

 

                   Given its
concession that the manner in which the tracking device was installed
constituted an unreasonable search, the Crown argued that it becomes
unnecessary to consider the extent to which the use of electronic tracking
devices generally violates s. 8 , and that the Court should not address the
issue.  I do not agree.  The use of these types of tracking devices on
automobiles poses important questions that will ultimately have to be resolved
in some form by Parliament, and it would, I think, be helpful if this Court
could provide some indication of the constitutionality of the use of electronic
tracking devices.  This is particularly important given the absence of any
applicable legislation.  Besides, the Crown's concession masks the fact that
two different methods of invading privacy are involved, the trespass to the
interior of the appellant's car and the electronic surveillance of his
movements, both of which may have implications for the assessment of whether
the evidence obtained should be rejected under s. 24(2) ; for a comparable
situation, see R. v. Thompson, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1111, at pp. 1150‑52
and at pp. 1182-83.  I would also note that this was the manner in which the
appellant's case was framed, and the issue has been fully addressed by both
parties.  I turn then to that issue.

 

                   I think it is
clear, given this Court's holdings in R. v. Duarte, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30,
and Wong, supra, that the use of an electronic tracking device is
a search within the meaning of the Charter .  In Wong, the
majority stated, at pp. 43-44, that it would be superfluous to undertake a
lengthy analysis into whether surreptitious video surveillance by the state
constitutes a search and seizure under s. 8 , and added:

 

In Duarte,
this Court held that unauthorized electronic audio surveillance violates
s. 8  of the Charter .  It would be wrong to limit the implications of
that decision to that particular technology.  Rather what the Court said in Duarte
must be held to embrace all existing means by which the agencies of the state
can electronically intrude on the privacy of the individual, and any means
which technology places at the disposal of law enforcement authorities in the
future.  [Emphasis added in third sentence.]

 

                   That reasoning
applies here.  It is true that, unlike the audio and video surveillance methods
employed in Duarte and Wong, the tracking device reveals only the
whereabouts of an individual, and does not extend to the interception and
recording of private communications.  It would be surprising, however, if the
ambit of the Charter 's protection did not extend to this area.  An
individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy not only in the
communications he makes, but in his movements as well.  Indeed, this
proposition was clearly enunciated in Wong, supra, at p. 47, in
the following passage:

 

George
Orwell in his classic dystopian novel 1984 paints a grim picture of a
society whose citizens had every reason to expect that their every movement
was subject to electronic video surveillance.  The contrast with the
expectations of privacy in a free society such as our own could not be more
striking.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   The underlying
rationale for this approach has been well stated by Professor Melvin Gutterman
in his article ""A Formulation of the Value and Means Models of the Fourth
Amendment in the Age of Technologically Enhanced Surveillance"" (1988), 39 Syracuse
L. Rev. 647, in the following passage, at p. 706:

 

                   In
a variety of public contexts, we may expect to be casually observed, but may
justifiably be outraged by intensive scrutiny.  In these public acts we do not
expect to be personally identified and subject to extensive surveillance, but
seek to merge into the ""situational landscape.""  The ability to move
about freely without constant supervision by the government is an important
source of individual liberty that must be addressed.  A fear of systematic
observation, even in public places, destroys this sense of freedom.  Justice
Douglas recognized the importance of this privacy value in a democratic
society, commenting that free movement is as dangerous to a tyrant as free
expression of ideas or the right of assembly and is, therefore, controlled in
most countries.

 

                   I must confess to
finding it absolutely outrageous that in a free society the police or other
agents of the state should have it within their power, at their sole discretion
and on the basis of mere suspicion, to attach a beeper on a person's car that
permits them to follow his or her movements night and day for extended periods.

 

                   As I noted in Duarte,
supra, at p. 44, I realize the necessity of police surveillance when
they suspect someone, and I also realize that it is vital for them to have
access, where reasonable, to electronic devices in the performance of their
difficult task of enforcing the law and detecting crime.  However, the Court is
not faced with the unpalatable choice of prohibiting the use of beepers
altogether but simply of imposing judicial control.  What I quarrel with is
that the police or other agents of the state should have the power to use
electronic equipment permitting them, at their whim, to know where any
particular individual may be at any time without the authorization of the
judiciary or some other independent third party.  This Court first asserted
this position in Hunter v. Southam Inc., supra, and has
consistently reasserted it since, in particular in relation to devices for
electronic surveillance; see Duarte and Wong.  The Court thus
stated the rationale for this position in Duarte, at p. 44:

 

                   The
reason for this protection is the realization that if the state were free, at
its sole discretion, to make permanent electronic recordings of our private
communications, there would be no meaningful residuum to our right to live our
lives free from surveillance.  The very efficacy of electronic surveillance is
such that it has the potential, if left unregulated, to annihilate any
expectation that our communications will remain private.

 

This equally applies to monitoring our
every movement.  The fact that in a particular case the police may be able ex
post facto to justify their action is of no moment.  The problem is that
society would have no way of knowing how many situations are not justifiable. 
To control the police, and more generally state power, in this context, prior
independent third party scrutiny is required, though as Dickson J. observed in Hunter
v. Southam Inc., this need not necessarily be done by a member of the
judiciary.

 

                   I am fully aware
that, in the absence of laws, such as exist in the Criminal Code 
respecting audio surveillance, the police may be deprived of the use of these
modern methods of crime detection.  But it is not the task of the Court to devise
means to assist the police to make use of these electronic media.  This too is
made clear in Wong, where at p. 57, it is stated:

 

                   This
is wholly consistent with my earlier observations in R. v. Landry,
[1986] 1 S.C.R. 145, at p. 187, and R. v. Bernard, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 833,
at p. 891, as to what I perceive to be the respective roles of the courts and
Parliament when Charter  rights and freedoms are at issue.  As I stated
there, it does not sit well for the courts, as the protectors of our
fundamental rights, to widen the possibility of encroachments on these personal
liberties.  It falls to Parliament to make incursions on fundamental rights if
it is of the view that they are needed for the protection of the public in a
properly balanced system of criminal justice.

 

The Court was there speaking of video
surveillance, but the same principle applies to the present case.  Later, on p.
57, it added:

 

It
is for Parliament, and Parliament alone, to set out the conditions under which
law enforcement agencies may employ video surveillance technology in their
fight against crime.  Moreover, the same holds true for any other technology
which the progress of science places at the disposal of the state in the years
to come.  Until such time as Parliament, in its wisdom, specifically provides
for a code of conduct for a particular invasive technology, the courts should
forebear from crafting procedures authorizing the deployment of the technology
in question.

 

See also R. v. Kokesch, supra,
at p. 28.

 

                   I should note at
this point that I am not impressed by the fact that the beeper in this case was
a rather unsophisticated device.  As we saw, the police with admirable ingenuity
were able to track the location of the appellant at all times.  But quite apart
from this, in this era of explosive technology, can it be long before a device
is developed that will be able to track our every movement for indefinite
periods even without visual surveillance?   We owe our statutory protection
against wiretapping to the fact that the courts of the United States, from
which our provisions largely derive, had the wisdom to strike down that form of
electronic surveillance at an early stage of its development.  This is the time
to begin regulating the use of electronic tracking devices while they are still
in their infancy and before the law enforcement authorities begin routinely
using them as part of their work habits.

 

The Issue of Public Roads

 

                   Perhaps the most
interesting argument presented in this appeal is the Crown's contention that
the appellant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy that was
violated in this case because the tracking device was only used to locate his whereabouts
on public roads.  Before going on, I should perhaps observe that this case is
not, of course, one where the police are engaged in monitoring the roads or
other public place by electronic means or otherwise in the course of regulating
or observing what goes on there.  What we are dealing with, we saw, is an
effort to track the movements of an individual through a device attached to his
car, an entirely different matter.

 

                   The Crown thus put
forth its position on this aspect of the case in its factum:

 

There
is no evidence that the Appellant's vehicle was ever tracked, by means of the
beeper, onto private property invisible from the street or onto property where
the Appellant was not a trespasser.  Furthermore, no permanent electronic
recording was made of either the words or activities of the Appellant.  It
is respectfully submitted that when the Appellant travelled over the public
streets he voluntarily conveyed to anyone who wanted to look, the fact that he
was travelling over particular roads in a particular direction, and the fact of
his final destination when he exited from public roads onto private property. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   The Crown supports
this position by reference to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United
States in United States v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276 (1983).  The Knotts
case concerned a charge of conspiracy to manufacture controlled substances. 
Visual surveillance had revealed where the suspects obtained chemicals required
to manufacture these substances.  An electronic tracking device, similar to the
one in the instant case, was placed inside a five gallon drum of chloroform
that was eventually purchased by an associate of the accused.  The tracking
device was used to track the movements of the drum which a co-accused transported
in his car to its ultimate location near a cabin in the woods.  The police
apparently did not rely upon the device from that point on, but set up a
three-day visual surveillance of the cabin that ultimately led to the accused's
arrest.  The court held that using an electronic device to trace an
individual's movements on a public road and to his ultimate destination did not
violate the Fourth Amendment.

 

                   The surveillance in
that case was far more limited than in the present case.  It consisted simply
of following a co-accused on public highways while he was in possession of a
specific article, the drum, in respect of which they had reason to suspect an
offence was about to be committed.  It invaded less than the present case on
the personal freedom of the individual.  Here the beeper was installed in the
appellant's personal automobile and his every move was thereby monitored at all
times for months, whatever activity he might be engaging in.  Even in Knotts,
at pp. 283-84, the court left to a later day the situation where the result
would be ""twenty-four hour surveillance of any citizen . . .
without judicial knowledge or supervision"".  Nonetheless, the court did
take the view that there is no expectation of privacy when one ventures onto a
public street.  At pages 281‑82, it stated:

 

                   A
person traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable
expectation of privacy in his movements from one place to another.  When
Petschen traveled over the public streets he voluntarily conveyed to anyone who
wanted to look the fact that he was traveling over particular roads in a
particular direction, the fact of whatever stops he made, and the fact of his
final destination when he exited from public roads onto private property.

 

                   While the views of
that court are undoubtedly entitled to great respect, I make no apology for
taking a more rigourous approach to the right of the state to interfere with
the citizen's freedom of movement, and as I see it the path proposed by the Knotts
decision is wholly inconsistent with the principles enunciated in previous
pronouncements of this Court.  In both Duarte and Wong, it was
made clear that the Court rejected the ""risk analysis"" approach,
i.e., the argument that the risk that an agent of the state will electronically
record one's words or actions is but a variant of the risk of having that
person disclose the words or actions to another.  I have no doubt that the
police, like other people, may observe our comings and goings when we place
ourselves in open view, and I would also think that they may enhance their
visual observations by the use of such instruments as binoculars.  This type of
observation does not pose grave or overriding threats to individual privacy. 
But Duarte and Wong both underlined the potential of uncontrolled
electronic surveillance to annihilate privacy, and its consequent danger to
individual autonomy and the organization of a free society.  They emphasized
that these sorts of threats to privacy ""are of a different order of
magnitude"" and ""involve different risks to the individual and the
body politic""; see Duarte, at p. 48.  The crucial point is that
there is a qualitative difference between the risk one takes that one's
movements in a car will be observed by others, including the authorities, and
the risk that one's vehicle will be monitored by a device that will follow its
every movement.  This is the proposition that lies at the heart of the Wong
decision.  It is as if one had an agent of the state in the car constantly
reporting one's location.  The question that must be asked is ""whether, by
the standards of privacy that persons can expect to enjoy in a free and
democratic society, the agents of the state were bound to conform to the
requirements of the Charter  when effecting the intrusion in
question""; see Wong, at pp. 45-46.  I think that in this case that
question must be answered in the affirmative.

 

                   The decisions in Wong
and Duarte are predicated on the notion that there exists a crucial
distinction between exposing ourselves to the risk that others will see us or
overhear our words, and the much more pernicious risk that they will be
electronically monitored at the sole discretion of the state.  Transposing to
the technology in question here, it must follow that there is an important
difference between courting the risk that our activities may be observed by
other persons and the risk that agents of the state, in the absence of prior
authorization, will track our every move.  In both instances, it is
constitutionally unacceptable that the state should be allowed to rest a
justification for the unauthorized electronic surveillance of a given person on
the mere fact that that person had been in a situation where he could be the
object of scrutiny on the part of private individuals.  To sanction state
intrusions on this basis is to blind oneself to the fact that the threat to
privacy inherent in courting the ordinary observations of other members of
society pales by comparison with the threat to privacy posed by allowing the
state to electronically monitor our every movement.  Section 8  of the Charter 
exists to protect privacy and not solitude.

 

                   As I view the
matter, the answer to the question whether a person whose movements were
surreptitiously tracked had a reasonable expectation of privacy in given
circumstances must not be made to depend on the degree to which that person
took measures to shield his or her activities from the scrutiny of other
persons.  Were that to be the case, the consequences in the crowded conditions
of modern life would be unacceptable.  We would effectively be shorn of our
right to be secure against electronic surveillance the moment we left our
dwellings, for a moment's reflection will confirm that as we go about our daily
business many, if not the majority, of our activities are inevitably carried
out in the plain view of other persons.  The prospect that the agents of the
state should be free, on account of this fact alone, to make it their business
to electronically track all our comings and goings is simply an unthinkable
prospect in a free and open society such as ours.

 

                   Professor Gutterman
has aptly summarized the position in the article cited, supra, at pp.
706-7:

 

                   Privacy
includes control over disclosure of our movements, or else it compels us to
live the life of a hermit.  Living in society, of necessity, requires the
revealing of private information for select purposes without sacrificing the
privacy of our daily activities.  To limit this freedom a stronger
justification than a mechanical incantation of ""public exposure"" is
required.  The Court must be reminded of the powerfully eloquent dissent of
Justice Brennan that electronic aids add a whole new dimension to surveillance;
""[t]hey make it more penetrating, more indiscriminate, more truly
obnoxious to a free society.  Electronic surveillance, in fact, makes the
police omniscient, and police omniscience is one of the most effective tools of
tyranny.""

 

                   As indicated
earlier, the grave threat to individual privacy posed by surreptitious electronic
tracking of one's movement is such as to require prior judicial authorization. 
And as Hunter v. Southam, supra, instructs us, the issuance of a
warrant to conduct a search will ordinarily call for an objective showing of
reasonable and probable cause by those seeking the warrant.  I see no reason
why this should not, at least generally, be the case when one seeks to employ
electronic tracking devices in the pursuit of an individual.  Given the
somewhat less intrusive nature of this means of surveillance, if properly
controlled, than electronic audio or video surveillance, a case might be made
for empowering a judicial officer in certain circumstances to accept a somewhat
lower standard, such as the ""solid ground"" for suspicion which the peace
officers claimed here, if it can be established that such a power is necessary
for the control of certain types of dangerous or pernicious crimes.  A passage
in Hunter v. Southam, cited infra, contemplates the possibility
of varying the standard in certain circumstances, and a lowering of the
standard was approved for entry into the country even without judicial
authorization in R. v. Simmons, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 495.  Still this should
not be permissible in the absence of cogent reasons.

 

                   There is another
aspect of this case that should be noted.  It would appear that the police were
as much concerned with the protection of the public against an individual they
thought was dangerous, as with detecting the source of earlier crimes.  Hunter
v. Southam, supra, instructs us that there may be occasions where
danger to some person may constitute a ground for lowering the standard.  At
pages 167-68 of that case, the former Chief Justice, then Dickson J., observed:

 

History
has confirmed the appropriateness of this requirement as the threshold for
subordinating the expectation of privacy to the needs of law enforcement. 
Where the state's interest is not simply law enforcement as, for instance,
where state security is involved, or where the individual's interest is not
simply his expectation of privacy as, for instance, when the search threatens
his bodily integrity, the relevant standard might well be a different one.

 

Dickson J. was there speaking of the
objective standard employed by a judicial officer.  The police also have power
to act without warrant where this is required for the protection of an
individual or property.  But I do not think this affords the police a licence
to engage in searches, including electronic tracking of a suspect, because they
believe that a particular individual may be dangerous, and that he may
therefore somewhere, sometime cause harm, even serious harm, to another.

 

                   It may at times be
difficult to accept that an individual -‑ even a dangerous individual -‑
should be allowed to escape the clutches of the law because law enforcement
bodies must be kept within constitutional norms.  But that is the price of
freedom.  Nor must we mislead ourselves that we are dealing here with mere
technicalities.  The great American jurist, Brennan J., with characteristic
vigour, thus responded to this misconception in a radio interview in 1987:

 

                   ""Honestly,""
Brennan said, raising his voice, ""you in the media ought to be ashamed of
yourselves to call the provisions and the guarantees of the Bill of Rights
`technicalities.'  They're not.  They're very basic to our very existence as
the kind of society we are.  We are what we are because we have those
guarantees, and this Court exists to see that those guarantees are faithfully
enforced.  They are not technicalities!  And no matter how awful may be the one
who is the beneficiary time and time again, guarantees have to be sustained,
even though the immediate result is to help out some very unpleasant person. 
They're there to protect all of us.""

 

See ""Profiles:  The
Constitutionalist"", The New Yorker, March 12, 1990, p. 45, at p.
65.

 

                   This sets the stage
for the discussion of whether the evidence should be rejected under s. 24(2) .

 

Application of s. 24(2) of the Charter

 

                   General
Considerations

 

                   In R. v. Collins,
supra, at pp. 283-84, the present Chief Justice, Lamer J., set forth a
number of criteria to be examined in determining whether the admission of
evidence obtained in violation of a Charter  right should be rejected as
tending to bring the administration of justice into disrepute, namely:

 

                   ‑what
kind of evidence was obtained?

                   ‑what
Charter  right was infringed?

                   ‑was
the Charter  violation serious or was it of a merely technical nature?

                   ‑was
it deliberate, wilful or flagrant, or was it inadvertent or committed in good
faith?

                   ‑did
it occur in circumstances of urgency or necessity?

                   ‑were
there other investigatory techniques available?

                   ‑would
the evidence have been obtained in any event?

                   ‑is
the offence serious?

                   ‑is
the evidence essential to substantiate the charge?

                   ‑are
other remedies available?

 

Lamer J. then grouped these factors
into three general categories:  (1) those affecting the fairness of the trial;
(2) those relating to the seriousness of the violation; and finally (3) those
relating to the effect on the reputation of the administration of justice.  He
added that the impact of the evidence on the fairness of the trial was the most
important consideration under s. 24(2).  See also R. v. Jacoy, [1988] 2
S.C.R. 548, at pp. 558-59.

 

                   The trial judge and
the Court of Appeal differed in their application of the above factors to the
case at bar.  The Court of Appeal emphasized that while the action of the
police was deliberate, it was undertaken in good faith, and only after other
investigatory techniques had proved futile.  Considering that the police were
investigating a possible serial killer, it thought the technique employed was
reasonable for both the investigation and prevention of crime.  The court was
of the opinion that the evidence was not ""conscriptive"" of the
accused in that he was not compelled by the police to do anything, but rather
went everywhere in his automobile of his own accord.

 

                   The trial judge, on
the other hand, stressed that the police action was a planned and on-going
invasion of the appellant's rights that continued twenty-four hours a day for a
period of at least one month.  In his opinion, the police were not operating on
reasonable and probable cause, but on mere suspicion.  He also found that the
evidence was conscriptive of the accused in that the appellant produced the
evidence by effectively operating the device by driving it around in his car.

 

                   Before going on, I
should again draw attention to the fact that the breach of the s. 8  right in
this case has two different aspects.  The manner in which the police installed
the beeper involved entering into and damaging (albeit in a minor manner) the
interior of the car at a time when they had no warrant to be there.  This
constituted an illegal trespass, and one moreover that took place in an area
where the appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy.  It was this
aspect of the breach on which the Court of Appeal focussed.  As we saw,
however, s. 8  was also violated by the use of the beeper to monitor the
appellant's every movement.  It was this aspect on which the trial judge
focussed.  In my view, both aspects deserve to be considered.  I turn now to a
discussion of the various factors grouped in the manner suggested in Collins.

 

                   Trial Fairness ‑
The Kind of Evidence

 

                   In discussing the
factors affecting the fairness of the trial, Lamer J. emphasized the importance
of distinguishing between real and conscriptive evidence.  While this
distinction is undoubtedly useful in many contexts, it would pose serious
problems for the fairness of a trial if it were to be adopted as a hard and
fast rule, and I do not think this is what Lamer J. had in mind.  I had
occasion to deal with this question in dealing with the problems relating to
derivative evidence in Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of
Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), [1990]
1 S.C.R. 425, at pp. 548-63.  At page 552, I had this to say:

 

                   I
would first of all note that I do not believe that in drawing this distinction,
Lamer J. intended to draw a hard and fast line between real evidence obtained
in breach of the Charter  and all other types of evidence that could be
so obtained.  He did not merely say that the admission of real evidence would
generally not affect the fairness of the trial of the accused; he said, at p.
284, that it would not generally affect the fairness of the trial because it
""existed irrespective of the violation of the Charter ""
(emphasis added).  Similarly, in reference to confessions ""or other
evidence emanating"" from the accused, he noted that ""it did not
exist prior to the violation"" (emphasis added).  I think this clearly
indicates that what Lamer J. had in mind was the much broader distinction
between evidence which the accused has been forced to create, and
evidence which he or she has been forced to merely locate or identify. 
In other words, he had in mind the kind of distinction which I have attempted
to draw between compelled testimony and evidence derived from compelled
testimony.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

The fact that evidence already existed
means that it could have been discovered in any event.  That is not so where
the evidence would not have existed but for the Charter  breach.  At page
553 of Thomson Newspapers, I added:

 

A
breach of the Charter  that forces the eventual accused to create
evidence necessarily has the effect of providing the Crown with evidence it
would not otherwise have had.  It follows that the strength of its case against
the accused is necessarily enhanced as a result of the breach.

 

I then added that this is the very
kind of prejudice the right against self-incrimination and the right to counsel
were intended to protect, and referred to several cases, notably R. v. Black,
[1989] 2 S.C.R. 138, and R. v. Ross, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 3, supporting this
method of approach to s. 24(2) in other contexts.

 

                   In the present
case, the distinction between real and conscriptive evidence does not appear
all that useful and, indeed, is not easy to make.  The evidence is not really
conscriptive in the sense that the accused was never induced by the police to
create evidence against himself.  However, as the trial judge notes, as a
result of the employment of the tracking device, the appellant was potentially
creating evidence against himself every single time he went out in his car. 
Such evidence would not have existed were it not for the tracking device
because visual contact with the accused had been lost.  In short, a large part
of the evidence against the accused is that he was tracked by unconstitutional
means to the area where the crime occurred.  It seems to me, therefore, that
this factor weighs in favour of the appellant.

 

                   The Seriousness
of the Violation

 

                   I turn, then, to
the second category of factors, those relating to the seriousness of the
violation.  There can be little doubt that the violation in this case was
serious.  Although the police ostensibly acted in good faith, the violation was
of such an intrusive and long-lasting nature that I believe that no other
conclusion is possible.  It might be noted that the search in this case appears
to have been part of a larger pattern of disregard for the appellant's rights. 
The police actually held a press conference where they all but identified the
appellant as a suspect (the press identified him the next day) even though they
admitted that they did not have enough evidence at that time to arrest him. 
The appellant was, not surprisingly, ""hounded"" by the media from that
point forward.

 

                   The intrusion into
the interior of the appellant's automobile, in complete disregard of his
rights, even after a search warrant had failed to provide evidence, is, by
itself, of a serious nature.  The words of Sopinka J. in Kokesch, supra,
are equally apt here.  He stated, at p. 29:

 

                   From
the point of view of individual privacy, which is the essential value protected
by s. 8  of the Charter , this illegal intrusion onto private property
must be seen as far from trivial or minimal.  Even before the enactment of the Charter ,
individuals were entitled to expect that their environs would be free of
prowling government officials unless and until the conditions for the exercise
of legal authority are met:  see Eccles v. Bourque, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 739;
and Colet v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 2.  The elevation of that
protection to the constitutional level signifies its deep roots in our legal
culture.

 

If the intrusion on even the environs
of a house is objectionable, the same can surely be said of intrusions into the
interior of an individual's automobile.

 

                   I turn then to
whether the police acted in good faith, or flagrantly.  I referred a moment ago
to the ""ostensible good faith"" of the police officers.  I understand
that the police were faced with a difficult situation.  Over a period of
several years there had been a number of killings in the area of which the
accused had been suspected.  Some time between May 17 and when the warrant was
obtained some two months later, an anonymous phone call was made to a news information
office claiming responsibility for the latest killing and stating that
""there's going to be a lot more"".  The police had some circumstantial
evidence that could be seen as linking the accused to several of the previous
murders and were concerned with preventing a further crime.  But as Sopinka J.
observed in Kokesch, at p. 30, in determining whether a s. 8  violation
was committed in ""good faith"" or was ""flagrant"", it must be
remembered that these words are terms of art in s. 24(2) cases.  In performing
the task, one of the first questions to ask is whether the police had
reasonable and probable cause.  That is underlined in Kokesch and also
figures large in R. v. Greffe, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 755, at pp. 795, 796 and
799.  In the present case the trial judge held the police had no reasonable and
probable grounds, and they themselves admitted it.  What they claimed to have,
and this is precisely what the police claimed in Kokesch, at p. 31,
where the evidence was rejected, was that they had ""solid grounds"".

 

                   Kokesch, at p. 28, and the cases there cited
are also authority for the view that ""the unavailability of other,
constitutionally permissible, investigative techniques is neither an excuse nor
a justification for constitutionally impermissible investigative
techniques"".  The police might well be excused for believing that they had
the right to use an electronic tracking device, though the fact that the Criminal
Code  prohibits the use of more established electronic devices without
authorization, and then only for a limited time, should have given them pause. 
But the police have no excuse concerning the manner in which they installed the
device.  I would have thought it elementary that everyone knows or should know
they have no right to enter into a person's automobile and do damage.  The
police here certainly knew they needed a warrant to search the car, and that
the warrant they had obtained did not permit what they did, and indeed had
expired.  To repeat the words of Sopinka J. in Kokesch, supra, at
p. 32:

 

                   Either
the police knew they were trespassing, or they ought to have known.  Whichever
is the case, they cannot be said to have proceeded in ""good faith"",
as that term is understood in s. 24(2) jurisprudence.

 

                   I conclude, then,
that the Charter  violation was very serious and not mitigated by good
faith on the part of the police officers.

 

                   Disrepute

 

                   Finally, I must
consider the factors relating to whether the admission of the evidence would
bring the administration of justice into disrepute, and the fact that the
accused cannot be convicted on the basis of the remaining evidence.  The
seriousness of the offence investigated certainly militates in favour of
inclusion given that the police were also concerned with the real possibility
of preventing a future crime, and not just with obtaining evidence.  However,
the seriousness of the crime and the proclivities of the accused must not be
viewed as ensuring admissibility.  In both Greffe, supra, and Kokesch,
there is every reason to think the accused there were, in the Court's view,
certainly guilty of a serious crime and would, if the opportunity presented
itself, continue in their unlawful activities.  At all events, one must not
forget that the proper limits placed on police authority apply at all stages of
law enforcement.  As Dickson J. put it in Hunter v. Southam, supra,
at p. 167:

 

The
state's interest in detecting and preventing crime begins to
prevail. . . where credibly-based probability replaces suspicion. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

In a free society the police cannot be
permitted to conduct the sort of intrusive search carried on in this case based
on mere suspicion, even strong suspicion.  That is clearly unacceptable in a
free society, and in my opinion would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.

 

                   Here the police did
not have reasonable and probable cause; they, themselves, did not think they
did, a conclusion confirmed by the trial judge's finding.  They might at one
stage have had reasonable and probable cause sufficient to support a warrant to
search the appellant's house and vehicle, and indeed, they were able to obtain
such a warrant.  However, when these searches turned up nothing to identify the
appellant with the crime, this negated some of the grounds upon which the
police had relied.  For example, the police had hypothesized that a pair of
work gloves contained in the back seat had been used in the commission of the
crime and that they might contain red paint chips from forcing open the freshly
painted side door to the garage of the King house.  No paint chips were found. 
It seems to me that proceeding further, after the search turned up nothing,
amounted to acting on mere suspicion.  (It is true that some of the analytical
tests had not yet been completed on the evidence obtained from the accused's
home when the tracking device was implanted; however, even after these tests
turned out to be negative the tracking continued.)  Under these circumstances,
the police were free to keep the appellant under surveillance, but absent
something more, there was no adequate ground for installing the tracking device
in the appellant's car.

 

                   In particular, the
police should not have invaded the interior of the appellant's automobile, and
so his privacy, to obtain evidence.  As I noted earlier, this was only one
aspect of their total disregard of the elementary duty and prudence that should
be employed in conducting police investigations.  I noted that they went to the
length of virtually informing the public that the appellant was the likely
perpetrator of multiple homicides, even though they lacked reasonable and
probable cause.  As Sopinka J. noted in Kokesch, supra, at p. 35:

 

This
Court must not be seen to condone deliberate unlawful conduct designed to
subvert both the legal and constitutional limits of police power to intrude on
individual privacy.  As Dickson C.J. stated in Genest, supra, at
p. 92:  ""the breach was not merely technical or minor"".  The
violation of s. 8  of the Charter  that occurred in this case must be
regarded as flagrant, and the disrepute to the justice system that would
necessarily result from the admission of the impugned evidence cannot be
counterbalanced by speculation about the disrepute that might flow from its
exclusion.

 

This Court has frequently expounded
the importance for the protection of the individual and the state, and indeed
the law enforcement authorities themselves, to stay within the bounds of the
constitutional and legal rules governing law enforcement, which be it noted
allow for some leeway for exigent circumstances, circumstances that did not
exist in this case.  Looking at the whole of the matter, I cannot help but
think the police officers here conducted themselves with the excessive zeal
against which Brandeis J. long ago warned us.  ""The greatest dangers to liberty
lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without
understanding""; see Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 (1928),
at p. 479, cited in R. v. Dyment, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417, at pp. 436-37.

 

                   I conclude, then,
that the long-term consequences of admitting evidence obtained in circumstances
like this on the integrity of our system of justice outweigh the harm done by
this accused being acquitted.  The end does not justify the means.  We must
respect our constitutional values and not barter them away for short-term
gains.  I refer again to the remarks of Brennan J., cited earlier, for the
proposition that, though we must pay a price, the rigorous enforcement of our
constitutional values enures to the benefit of all of us.

 

Disposition

 

                   For these reasons,
I would allow the appeal and restore the acquittal.

 

//Sopinka J.//

 

                   The reasons of
Sopinka and Iacobucci JJ. were delivered by

 

                   Sopinka
J. (dissenting) -- I have
read the reasons for judgment proposed by my colleagues, Justices La Forest and
Cory, and find that I am in agreement with the result reached by La Forest J. 
I would dispose of the appeal on more limited grounds leaving for another
occasion the broader issue as to whether surreptitious electronic tracking of
the kind involved in this case can only be carried out pursuant to prior
judicial authorization prescribed by statute.

 

                   As my colleagues
both point out, the Crown has quite properly conceded that the installation of
the tracking device in the appellant's automobile constitutes an unreasonable
search or seizure so as to violate s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms .  The facts are so similar to those in R. v. Kokesch,
[1990] 3 S.C.R. 3, that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to come to a
different result with respect to violation of s. 8 .  In both cases, a trespass
by the police which the police knew or ought to have known was unlawful,
enabled them to engage in surveillance of the activities of a suspect which
eventually led to the discovery of incriminating evidence.  In both cases, the
nexus between the trespass, the surveillance and the discovery of the evidence
is sufficient to conclude that the evidence was obtained in a manner that
violates the Charter .  It is not necessary here, as it was not in Kokesch,
to consider whether the surveillance itself, in the absence of trespass, would
violate s. 8 .  While I agree with my colleague La Forest J. that legislation is
desirable in this area, I would refrain from expressing an opinion as to the
form that it should take.  I am not prepared to say in advance whether prior
judicial authorization will be necessary or whether statutory authority simpliciter
will suffice.

 

                   I agree with my
colleague, La Forest J., that the admission of the evidence would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute and, in conformity with s. 24(2)  of
the Charter , the evidence should be rejected.  In my opinion, we would
attribute to the arbiter of this question too high a degree of subtlety if we
tried to distinguish this case from Kokesch.  I do not think that there
is a sufficient distinction between entering onto private premises (not the
dwelling itself) and unlawfully damaging the seat of an automobile to warrant a
different result.  The significant fact for Charter  purposes is the
illegal trespass knowingly committed by the police.  Nor do I view the fact
that in this case the police suspected the appellant of a more serious offence
as a significant distinction.  Mere suspicion remains just suspicion and it
cannot be used to redeem Charter  violations on the basis of the nature
of the offence suspected.

 

                   I would dispose of
the appeal as proposed by La Forest J.

                   The accused owned a
shop selling and renting ""hard core"" videotapes and magazines as well
as sexual paraphernalia.  He was charged with various counts of selling obscene
material, possessing obscene material for the purpose of distribution or sale,
and exposing obscene material to public view, contrary to s. 159 (now s.
163) of the Criminal Code .  Section 163(8) of the Code provides
that ""any publication a dominant characteristic of which is the undue
exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one or more of  . . . crime, horror,
cruelty and violence, shall be deemed to be obscene"".  The trial judge
concluded that the obscene material was protected by the guarantee of freedom
of expression in s. 2 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms , and that prima facie only those materials which contained
scenes involving violence or cruelty intermingled with sexual activity or
depicted lack of consent to sexual contact or otherwise could be said to
dehumanize men or women in a sexual context were legitimately proscribed under
s. 1 .  He convicted the accused on eight counts relating to eight films
and entered acquittals on the remaining charges.  The Crown appealed the
acquittals.  The Court of Appeal, in a majority decision, allowed the appeal
and entered convictions with respect to all the counts.  The majority concluded
that the materials in question fell outside the protection of the Charter 
since they constituted purely physical activity and involved the undue
exploitation of sex and the degradation of human sexuality.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be allowed and a
new trial directed on all charges.  Section 163  of the Criminal Code 
infringes s. 2 (b) of the Charter  but can be justified under
s. 1  of the Charter .

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest, Sopinka,
Cory, McLachlin, Stevenson and Iacobucci JJ.:  While the constitutional
questions as stated concern s. 163  in its entirety, this appeal should be
confined to an examination of the constitutional validity of the definition of
obscenity in s. 163(8) .  Section 163(8)  provides an exhaustive test of
obscenity with respect to publications and objects which exploit sex as a
dominant characteristic.  In order for a work or material to qualify as
""obscene"", the exploitation of sex must not only be its dominant
characteristic, but such exploitation must be ""undue"".  The courts
have attempted to formulate workable tests to determine when the exploitation
of sex is ""undue"".  The most important of these is the
""community standard of tolerance"" test.  This test is concerned not
with what Canadians would not tolerate being exposed to themselves, but with
what they would not tolerate other Canadians being exposed to.  There has been
a growing recognition in recent cases that material which may be said to
exploit sex in a ""degrading or dehumanizing"" manner will necessarily
fail the community standards test, not because it offends against morals but
because it is perceived by public opinion to be harmful to society,
particularly women.  In the appreciation of whether material is degrading or
dehumanizing, the appearance of consent is not necessarily determinative.  The
last step in the analysis of whether the exploitation of sex is undue is the
""internal necessities"" test or artistic defence.  Even material which
by itself offends community standards will not be considered ""undue""
if it is required for the serious treatment of a theme.  Thus far the
jurisprudence has failed to specify the relationship of these tests to each
other.

 

                   The courts must
determine as best they can what the community would tolerate others being
exposed to on the basis of the degree of harm that may flow from such
exposure.  Harm in this context means that it predisposes persons to act in an
anti‑social manner, in other words, a manner which society formally
recognizes as incompatible with its proper functioning.  The stronger the
inference of a risk of harm, the lesser the likelihood of tolerance.  The
portrayal of sex coupled with violence will almost always constitute the undue
exploitation of sex.  Explicit sex which is degrading or dehumanizing may be
undue if the risk of harm is substantial.  Explicit sex that is not violent and
neither degrading nor dehumanizing is generally tolerated in our society and
will not qualify as the undue exploitation of sex unless it employs children in
its production.  If material is not obscene under this framework, it does not
become so by reason of the person to whom it is or may be shown or by reason of
the place or manner in which it is shown.

 

                   The need to apply
the ""internal necessities"" test arises only if a work contains
sexually explicit material that by itself would constitute the undue
exploitation of sex.  The portrayal of sex must then be viewed in context to
determine whether undue exploitation of sex is the main object of the work or
whether the portrayal of sex is essential to a wider artistic,  literary or
other similar purpose.  The court must determine whether the sexually explicit
material when viewed in the context of the whole work would be tolerated by the
community as a whole.  Any doubt in this regard must be resolved in favour of
freedom of expression.

 

                   Section 163 of
the Code seeks to prohibit certain types of expressive activity and
thereby infringes s. 2 (b) of the Charter .  Activities cannot
be excluded from the scope of the guaranteed freedom on the basis of the
content or meaning being conveyed.

 

                   The infringement is
justifiable under s. 1  of the Charter .  Section 163(8) , as
interpreted in prior judgments and supplemented by these reasons, prescribes an
intelligible standard.  The overriding objective of s. 163  is not moral
disapprobation but the avoidance of harm to society, and this is a sufficiently
pressing and substantial concern to warrant a restriction on freedom of
expression.  One does not have to resort to the ""shifting purpose""
doctrine in order to identify the objective as the avoidance of harm to
society.  There is a sufficiently rational link between the criminal sanction,
which demonstrates our community's disapproval of the dissemination of materials
which potentially victimize women and restricts the negative influence which
such materials have on changes in attitudes and behaviour, and the objective. 
While a direct link between obscenity and harm to society may be difficult to
establish, it is reasonable to presume that exposure to images bears a causal
relationship to changes in attitudes and beliefs.  Section 163 of the Code
minimally impairs freedom of expression.  It does not proscribe sexually
explicit erotica without violence that is not degrading or dehumanizing, but is
designed to catch material that creates a risk of harm to society.  Materials
which have scientific, artistic or literary merit are not caught by the
provision.  Since the attempt to provide exhaustive instances of obscenity has
been shown to be destined to fail, the only practical alternative is to strive
towards a more abstract definition of obscenity which is contextually
sensitive.  The standard of ""undue exploitation"" is thus
appropriate.  Further, it is only the public distribution and exhibition of
obscene materials which is in issue here.  Given the gravity of the harm, and
the threat to the values at stake, there is no alternative equal to the measure
chosen by Parliament.  Serious social problems such as violence against women
require multi‑pronged approaches by government; education and legislation
are not alternatives but complements in addressing such problems.  Finally, the
effects of the law do not so severely trench on the protected right that the
legislative objective is outweighed by the infringement.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé and Gonthier
JJ.:  Sopinka J.'s reasons were generally agreed with, subject to the following
comments.  The subject matter of s. 163 of the Code, obscene
materials, comprises the dual elements of representation and content, and it is
the combination of the two that attracts criminal liability.  Obscenity is not
limited to the acts prohibited in the Code:  Parliament ascribed a
broader content to it because it involves a representation.  Obscenity leads to
many ills.  Obscene materials convey a distorted image of human sexuality, by
making public and open elements of human nature that are usually hidden behind
a veil of modesty and privacy.  These materials are often evidence of the
commission of reprehensible actions in their making, and can induce attitudinal
changes which may lead to abuse and harm.

 

                   Parliament through
s. 163  prohibits, and does not regulate, the circulation of obscene
materials.  In determining whether they are obscene, the impugned materials
must therefore be presumed available to the Canadian public at large, since
restrictions on availability are the result of regulatory measures which fall
outside the purview of these provisions.

 

                   Explicit sex with
violence will generally constitute undue exploitation of sex, and explicit sex
that is degrading or dehumanizing will be undue if it creates a substantial
risk of harm, as outlined by Sopinka J.  Explicit sex that is neither violent
nor degrading or dehumanizing may also come within the definition of obscene in
s. 163(8) .  While the content of this category of materials is generally
perceived as unlikely to cause harm, there are exceptions, such as child
pornography.  As well, it is quite conceivable that the representation may cause
harm, even if its content as such is not seen as harmful.  While the actual
audience to which the materials are presented is not relevant, the manner of
representation can greatly contribute to the deformation of sexuality, through
the loss of its humanity, and make it socially harmful.  The likelihood of
harm, and the tolerance of the community, may vary according to the medium of
representation, even if the content stays the same.  The overall type or use of
the representation may also be relevant.  The assessment of the risk of harm
here depends on the tolerance of the community.  If the community cannot
tolerate the risk of harm, then the materials, even though they may offer a
non-violent, non-degrading, non-dehumanizing content, will constitute undue
exploitation of sex and fall within the definition of obscenity.

 

                   Section 163 of the Code
is aimed at preventing harm to society, a moral objective that is valid under
s. 1  of the Charter .  The avoidance of harm to society is but one
instance of a fundamental conception of morality.  In order to warrant an
override of Charter  rights the moral claims must be grounded; they must
involve concrete problems such as life, harm and well‑being, and not
merely differences of opinion or taste.  A consensus must also exist among the
population on these claims.  The avoidance of harm caused to society through
attitudinal changes certainly qualifies as a fundamental conception of
morality.  It is well grounded, since the harm takes the form of violations of
the principles of human equality and dignity.

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and La Forest, Sopinka, Cory, McLachlin, Stevenson and Iacobucci was
delivered by

 

                   Sopinka J. -- This appeal calls into
question the constitutionality of the obscenity provisions of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 163 .  They are attacked on
the ground that they contravene s. 2 (b) of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms .  The case requires the Court to address one of the
most difficult and controversial of contemporary issues, that of determining
whether, and to what extent, Parliament may legitimately criminalize
obscenity.  I propose to begin with a review of the facts which gave rise to
this appeal, as well of the proceedings in the lower courts.

 

1.  Facts and Proceedings

 

                   In August 1987, the
appellant, Donald Victor Butler, opened the Avenue Video Boutique located in
Winnipeg, Manitoba.  The shop sells and rents ""hard core"" videotapes
and magazines as well as sexual paraphernalia.  Outside the store is a sign
which reads:

 

""Avenue
Video Boutique; a private members only adult video/visual club.

 

Notice: 
if sex oriented material offends you, please do not enter.

 

No
admittance to persons under 18 years.

 

                   On August 21, 1987,
the City of Winnipeg Police entered the appellant's store with a search warrant
and seized all the inventory.  The appellant was charged with 173 counts in the
first indictment:  three counts of selling obscene material contrary to
s. 159(2)(a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C‑34 (now s. 163(2) (a)), 41 counts of possessing obscene
material for the purpose of distribution contrary to s. 159(1)(a)
(now s. 163(1) (a)) of the Criminal Code , 128 counts of possessing
obscene material for the purpose of sale contrary to s. 159(2) (a)
of the Criminal Code  and one count of exposing obscene material to
public view contrary to s. 159(2) (a) of the Criminal Code .

 

                   On October 19,
1987, the appellant reopened the store at the same location.  As a result of a
police operation a search warrant was executed on October 29, 1987, resulting
in the arrest of an employee, Norma McCord.  The appellant was arrested at a
later date.

 

                   A joint indictment
was laid against the appellant doing business as Avenue Video Boutique and
Norma McCord.  The joint indictment contains 77 counts under s. 159  (now
s. 163 ) of the Criminal Code :  two counts of selling obscene
material contrary to s. 159(2) (a), 73  counts of possessing obscene
material for the purpose of distribution contrary to s. 159(1) (a),
one count of possessing obscene material for the purpose of sale contrary to
s. 159(2) (a) and one count of exposing obscene material to public
view contrary to s. 159(2) (a).

 

                   The trial judge
convicted the appellant on eight counts relating to eight films.  Convictions
were entered against the co‑accused McCord with respect to two counts
relating to two of the films.  Fines of $1,000 per offence were imposed on the
appellant.  Acquittals were entered on the remaining charges.

 

                   The Crown appealed
the 242 acquittals with respect to the appellant and the appellant cross‑appealed
the convictions.  The majority of the Manitoba Court of Appeal allowed the
appeal of the Crown and entered convictions for the appellant with respect to
all of the counts, Twaddle and Helper JJ.A. dissenting.

 

Court of Queen's Bench (1989), 50 C.C.C. (3d) 97

 

                   Wright J. first
considered whether the materials were obscene within the meaning of
s. 163(8)  of the Criminal Code .  He noted that Canadian courts have
interpreted the application of the ""community standards"" test to mean
that as long as the trier of fact does not apply his or her subjective personal
views but seeks objectively to ascertain the community standard, he or she may
resolve that issue simply by drawing on his or her ""experience"". 
Wright J. expressed serious difficulties in applying the community standards
test, stating that to render a factual decision on the basis of experience is
contrary to the judicial role and that he regards his own views drawn from his
""experience"" to be unreliable.  However, Wright J. was able to
conclude on the basis of previous case law that the materials in question were
obscene (at p. 113):

 

                   In
the context of my own inability to confidently draw on my experience, and my
belief, in any event, that it is incongruous and inconsistent with basic
judicial legal principles to do so, normally I would be inclined to hold that
the requisite community standard of tolerance has not been proved as an
essential ingredient of the Crown's case and all the charges should be
dismissed.

 

                   However,
it is clear, from a review of the case‑law binding on me that independent
of the manner in which a trial judge is directed to measure obscenity, material
of the kind before the court has been well established as obscene and must
continue to be regarded as obscene within the Criminal Code  definition.

 

                   Applying the
Canadian decisions on obscenity since the inclusion of s. 163  in the Criminal
Code , Wright J. found that there was no doubt that the videos and magazines
in the present case fall into the category of ""hard porn"" and that
the sexual devices are similar to the kind of sexual paraphernalia held by this
Court in Dechow v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 951, and Germain
v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 241, to fall under the obscenity
definition.  Accordingly, he found that all of the materials referred to in the
various charges in the indictments are obscene according to the case law
interpretation of s. 163(8) .

 

                   Wright J. then
concluded that the obscene material was protected by s. 2 (b) of the
Charter .  Following the principles in Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec
(Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927, he noted that obscene
expression reflected in the material certainly conveys meaning and is entitled
to protection provided the form of expression is not violent.

 

                   In conducting the
s. 1  analysis, Wright J. was of the view that legislation which seeks to
proscribe a fundamental freedom must have as its objective a more precise
purpose than simply to control the morals of society or to encourage decency. 
He wrote, at p. 121:

 

The
aim must be directed more specifically to objectives such as equality concerns,
or other Charter  rights, or particular human rights; otherwise, the basic
freedoms in the Charter  will be subject to restrictions that arise from very
personal and subjective opinions of right and wrong that will be impossible to
identify . . . .

 

                   Examples
of more precise aims or bases for restrictions will be:

 

(1)The
protection of people from involuntary exposure to pornographic material;

 

(2)the
protection of the vulnerable, for example children, from either exposure or
participation;

 

(3)the
prevention of the circulation of pornographic material that effectively reduces
the human or equality or other Charter  rights of individuals.  This may arise,
and often will arise, in material that mixes sex with violence or cruelty, or
otherwise dehumanizes women or men.

 

                   Applying these
standards, he concluded that on a prima facie basis, only those
materials which contained scenes involving violence or cruelty intermingled
with sexual activity or depicted lack of consent to sexual contact or otherwise
could be said to dehumanize men or women in a sexual context were legitimately
proscribed under s. 1 .  With respect to the material and sexual devices
covered by the remaining counts he said, at pp. 124-25:

 

                   The
material covered by the remaining counts in the indictments, relating to the
magazines and the videos, reflects consensual activity by adult individuals not
involving force, duress or cruelty.  In this context, I am unable to conclude
that the depiction of the human body or any of its parts, no matter how
explicitly presented, or the visual presentation of masturbation, group sex or
other heterosexual or homosexual activity, including incestuous relations, prima
facie relate to sufficiently specific concerns which are pressing and
substantial in a free and democratic society to justify restricting or limiting
the basic freedom permitting them to be expressed.  The same reasoning applies
in respect of the material before the court described as sexual toys or
devices.  The Crown has failed to bring forward cogent and persuasive evidence
to demonstrate the specific objectives sought to be achieved, and to show that
such objectives justify the limits on freedom of expression which the impugned
legislation seeks to bring about.

 

                   In reaching his
conclusion, Wright J. decided the definition set forth in s. 163(8)  is not
on its face in contravention of the Charter  although it can be
interpreted to cover more ground than the Charter  provisions would
permit in the context of the evidence.  He stated as to the appropriate remedy
(at p. 125):

 

If
the interpretation places the section in conflict with the Charter  and the
evidence required to permit the broader scope of the section to stand is
lacking, then the remedy is simply to hold that the Charter  provisions are
paramount.  It is not necessary to strike down the Criminal Code 
provision as unconstitutional.

 

                   Wright J. held that
the videotapes identified in 16 of the counts contained material that has been
legitimately proscribed according to the requirements of s. 1  of the Charter . 
These 16 counts related to eight films.  In most cases, the appellant was
charged with possession for the purpose of sale on the one hand and possession
for the purpose of distribution or circulation on the other.  Wright J. therefore
entered eight convictions against the appellant, one with respect to each pair
of charges covering similar content.

 

Manitoba Court of Appeal (1990), 60 C.C.C. (3d) 219

 

                   Huband J.A.
(O'Sullivan and Lyon JJ.A. concurring)

 

                   Huband J.A.,
speaking for the majority, first noted that the approach taken by the trial
judge was incorrect in that he focused the s. 1  inquiry on the individual
films rather than on s. 163  of the Criminal Code .  Counsel for both
parties also agreed that the trial judge had misdirected himself in judging the
materials rather than the provision.

 

                   With respect to
Wright J.'s finding that all of the materials in question were obscene, Huband
J.A. noted that no serious argument was made that this finding was wrong and
concluded that it should not be interfered with.

 

                   Huband J.A. then
considered whether s. 163  contravenes s. 2 (b) of the Charter . 
Based on their content, he concluded that the materials in this case constitute
""purely physical"" activity which does not convey or attempt to convey
meaning.  Huband J.A. also noted that the form of expression also fell outside
the protection of the Charter , as it consists in the undue exploitation
of sex and the degradation of human sexuality.  In his view, the form of the
activity is not one which the Charter  was designed or intended to
protect.

 

                   With respect to the
purpose and effect of s. 163 , Huband J.A. stated (at pp. 230-31):

 

The
intent of the legislation is to bar the distribution or sale of prurient
materials devoid of a redeeming meaning.  As to effect, on the evidence in this
case it does not appear that the obscenity provisions in the Code have
thwarted or subverted anyone in conveying or attempting to convey a meaningful
message.

 

                   Accordingly, the
majority did not consider it necessary to pursue a s. 1  inquiry.

 

                   Twaddle J.A.,
dissenting

 

                   First, Twaddle J.A.
noted that we are not concerned in the present case with the form of expression
but with its content.  In his view, the content of a video movie, the content
of a magazine and the imagery of a sexual gadget are all within the scope of
freedom of expression.  Any limit on their creation, publication or
distribution must be reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society.

 

                   Before proceeding
to the s. 1  analysis, Twaddle J.A. expressed the opinion that
s. 163(8)  envisages two distinct offences with different objectives, and
that each offence should be considered separately for constitutional validity. 
Twaddle J.A. was of the view that the portion of s. 163  dealing with
the ""undue exploitation of sex"" is concerned with the maintenance of
moral standards, while the concept of sex coupled with one or more of crime,
horror, cruelty and violence is aimed at harm.  While the avoidance of harm is
universally accepted as a legitimate goal, he concluded that a law which is
aimed at deciding for someone else what he may read or view is discordant with
the principles integral to a free and democratic society.

 

                   Twaddle J.A.
decided that taken as an undivided proscription, s. 163  does not focus on
achieving a single purpose (at pp. 246-47):

 

Although
there are several important purposes which it serves, the proscription is
overbroad and unrefined.  It disables those who wish to see sexually explicit
movies from seeing those movies which, harmless in themselves, are deemed too
""dirty"" to be tolerated by the community . . . .

 

                   If
the proscription is divided into two, however, the proscription against the
undue exploitation of sex coupled with one or more of crime, horror, cruelty
and violence has the pressing and substantial purpose of avoiding the risk of
harm and that purpose is achieved without sacrificing freedom of expression
more than is necessary to achieve it. 

 

                   He was of the view
that Parliament was entitled to have a reasoned apprehension of harm resulting
from the desensitization of individuals exposed to books or movies which
portray sex with any dehumanizing feature.  In this respect, he found the limit
on the Charter  freedom justified because of the importance of avoiding
indifference to violence in so far as women are concerned, and the
dehumanization of people.  Therefore, Twaddle J.A. severed the two
proscriptions and held the proscription of publications which ""unduly
exploit sex"" alone to be invalid.  Since the trial judge arrived at the
same result and convicted only where the materials unduly exploit sex coupled
with cruelty, violence or other dehumanizing features, Twaddle J.A. would have
dismissed both the appeals of the Crown and of the accused.

 

                   Helper J.A.,
dissenting

 

                   Helper J.A. also
found that the materials in this case are protected by s. 2 (b) of
the Charter .  She stressed that the degree of offensiveness of the
materials cannot be the criterion for determining whether or not the expression
comes within the meaning of s. 2 (b) of the Charter .

 

                   In determining
whether the infringement of freedom of expression is justified under s. 1 ,
Helper J.A. was of the view that it is a legitimate objective of Parliament to
prevent the publication and circulation of materials depicting cruelty,
dehumanization, degradation and violence.  In her view, the evidence shows the
circulation of such material may lead to an increase in the incidence of
aggressive, harmful behaviour and further can lead to attitudinal changes that
are antithetical to the Charter , specifically to its s. 28 .  Helper
J.A. rejected the trial judge's determination that morality is not a sufficient
basis for imposing limitations on fundamental freedoms.  In her view, morality
in the broader sense, as in the present case, encompassing respect for human
beings, protection of the public generally or of vulnerable individuals or
groups of the public from harm is a sufficiently pressing and substantial
objective warranting the intervention of Parliament.

 

                   However, Helper
J.A. found that s. 163  was too vague to pass the remainder of the
s. 1  test.  She stated, at p. 266:

 

. .
. Parliament chose the terminology ""undue exploitation of sex"" in
s. 163(8)  and by so doing left the criteria for the application of the
standard to the judiciary.  It is not the judicial function to define the
material or actions which are to be proscribed by law.  Parliament has
abdicated its responsibility in s. 163 of the Code.  The present
law which fails to define with precision the limit on sexual expression is too
arbitrary and too vague to withstand the scrutiny of s. 1 .

 

                   Helper J.A. also
concluded that the legislation failed the proportionality test in that it was
overreaching and did not impair freedom of expression as little as possible, as
it could result in the conviction of one who deals in material containing no
element of cruelty, dehumanization, violence or degradation and in the absence
of any evidence of harm or risk of harm to society.  Having concluded that
s. 163(8)  does not constitute a reasonable limit under s. 1 , Helper
J.A. would have allowed the appeals against conviction and entered acquittals
on all charges against both accused.

 

2.  Relevant Legislation

 

Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 

 

                   163.  (1)  Every one commits an

picture, model, phonograph record or other thing whatever; or

 

(b)  makes,
prints, publishes, distributes, sells or has in his possession for the purpose
of publication, distribution or circulation a crime comic.

 

                   (2)  Every
one commits an offence who knowingly, without lawful justification or excuse,

 

(a)  sells,
exposes to public view or has in his possession for such a purpose any obscene
written matter, picture, model, phonograph record or other thing whatever;

 

(b)  publicly
exhibits a disgusting object or an indecent show;

                   (3)  No
person shall be convicted of an offence under this section if he establishes
that the public good was served by the acts that are alleged to constitute the
offence and that the acts alleged did not extend beyond what served the public
good.

 

                   (4)  For
the purposes of this section, it is a question of law whether an act served the
public good and whether there is evidence that the act alleged went beyond what
served the public good, bur it is a question of fact whether the acts did or
did not extend beyond what served the public good.

 

                   (5)  For
the purposes of this section, the motives of an accused are irrelevant.

 

                   (6) 
Where an accused is charged with an offence under subsection (1), the fact that
the accused was ignorant of the nature or presence of the matter, picture,
model, phonograph record, crime comic or other thing by means of or in relation
to which the offence was committed is not a defence to the charge.

 

                   (7)  In
this section, ""crime comic"" means a magazine, periodical or book that
exclusively or substantially comprises matter depicting pictorially

 

(a)  the
commission of crimes, real or fictitious; or

 

(b)  events
connected with the commission of crimes, real or fictitious, whether occurring
before or after the commission of the crime.

 

                   (8)  For
the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant characteristic of which is
the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one or more of the following
subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence, shall be deemed to be
obscene.

 

3.  Issues

 

                   The following
constitutional questions are raised by this appeal:

 

1.                Does
s. 163 of the Criminal Code  of Canada, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
violate s. 2 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

 

2.                If
s. 163 of the Criminal Code  of Canada, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
violates s. 2 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ,
can s. 163  of the Criminal Code  of Canada be demonstrably justified
under s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  as a
reasonable limit prescribed by law?

 

4.  Analysis

 

                   The constitutional
questions, as stated, bring under scrutiny the entirety of s. 163 . 
However, both lower courts as well as the parties have focused almost
exclusively on the definition of obscenity found in s. 163(8) .  Other
portions of the impugned provision, such as the reverse onus provision
envisaged in s. 163(3) as well as the absolute liability offence created
by s. 163(6), raise substantial Charter  issues which should be left
to be dealt with in proceedings specifically directed to these issues.  In my
view, in the circumstances, this appeal should be confined to the examination
of the constitutional validity of s. 163(8)  only.

 

                   Before proceeding
to consider the constitutional questions, it will be helpful to review the
legislative history of the provision as well as the extensive judicial
interpretation and analysis which have infused meaning into the bare words of
the statute.

 

A.  Legislative History

 

                   Parliament's first
attempt to criminalize obscenity was in s. 179 of the Criminal Code,
1892, S.C. 1892, c. 29, which provided in part as follows:

 

                   179.  Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to two years' imprisonment who knowingly, without lawful
justification or excuse --

 

                   (a.)  publicly
sells, or exposes for public sale or to public view, any obscene book, or other
printed or written matter, or any picture, photograph, model or other object, tending
to corrupt morals; or

 

                   (b.)  publicly
exhibits any disgusting object or any indecent show;

 

                   (c.)  offers
to sell, advertises, publishes an advertisement of or has for sale or disposal
any medicine, drug or article intended or represented as a means of preventing
conception or causing abortion.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   In 1949, Parliament
repealed the successor to s. 179 and substituted it with the following
provision:

 

                   207. (1)  Every one who is
guilty of an indictable offence and liable to two years' imprisonment who

 

(a)makes,
prints, publishes, distributes, circulates, or has in possession for any such
purpose any obscene written matter, picture, model or other thing whatsoever;
or

 

(b)prints,
publishes, distributes, sells or has in possession for any such purpose, any crime
comic.

 

                   (2)  Every
one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to two years' imprisonment
who knowingly, without lawful justification or excuse

 

(a)sells,
exposes to public view or has in possession for any such purpose any obscene
written matter, picture, model or other thing whatsoever;

 

(b)publicly
exhibits any disgusting object or any indecent show; or

 

(c)offers
to sell, advertises, publishes an advertisement of, or has for sale or disposal
any means, instructions, medicine, drug or article intended or represented as a
means of preventing conception or causing abortion or miscarriage or advertises
or publishes an advertisement of any means, instructions, medicine, drug or
article for restoring sexual virility or curing venereal diseases or diseases
of the generative organs.

 

 

                   The Criminal
Code  did not provide a definition of any of the operative terms,
""obscene"", ""indecent"" or ""disgusting"".  The notion
of obscenity embodied in these provisions was based on the test formulated by
Cockburn C.J. in R. v. Hicklin (1868), L.R. 3 Q.B. 360, at p. 371:

 

. .
. I think the test of obscenity is this, whether the tendency of the matter
charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to
such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort may
fall.

 

                   The focus on the
""corruption of morals"" in the earlier legislation grew out of the
English obscenity law which made the court the ""guardian of public
morals"".  As Charron Dist. Ct. J. stated in R. v. Fringe Product Inc.
(1990), 53 C.C.C. (3d) 422 (Ont. Dist. Ct.), at pp. 441-42:

 

                   When
one looks at the legislative history of the obscenity provisions of the Code,
it is clear that when the English Court of King's Bench first asserted itself
in this field following the demise of the Star Chamber in 1641, it did so as
the guardian of public morals:  R. v. Sidley (1663), 1 Sid. 168, 82 E.R.
1036.  The crime of publishing an obscene libel was created in 1727 in the case
of R. v. Curl (1727), 2 Stra. 788, 93 E.R. 849, when the court
accepted the argument that publishing an obscene libel tended to corrupt the
morals of the King's subjects and as such was against the peace of the King and
government.

 

                   The current
provision, which is the subject of this appeal, entered into force in 1959 in
response to the much criticized former version (Criminal Code,
S.C. 1953‑54, c. 51, s. 150).  Unlike the previous
statutes, subs. (8) provided a statutory definition of
""obscene"":

 

                   150.  . . .

 

                   (8)  For
the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant characteristic of which is
the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one or more of the following
subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence, shall be deemed to be
obscene.

 

                   As will be
discussed further, the introduction of the statutory definition had the effect
of replacing the Hicklin test with a series of rules developed by the
courts.  The provision must be considered in light of these tests.

 

B.  Judicial Interpretation of
s. 163(8) 

 

                   The first case to
consider the current provision was Brodie v. The Queen, [1962] S.C.R.
681.  The majority of this Court found in that case that
D. H. Lawrence's novel, Lady Chatterley's Lover, was not
obscene within the meaning of the Code.  The Brodie case lay the
groundwork for the interpretation of s. 163(8)  by setting out the
principal tests which should govern the determination of what is obscene for
the purposes of criminal prosecution.  The first step was to discard the Hicklin
test.

 

                   (a)  Section
163(8)  to be Exclusive Test

 

                   In examining the
definition provided by subs. (8), the majority of this Court was of the
view that the new provision provided a clean slate and had the effect of
bringing in an ""objective standard of obscenity"" which rendered all
the jurisprudence under the Hicklin definition obsolete.  In the words
of Judson J. (at p. 702):

 

. .
. I think that the new statutory definition does give the Court an opportunity
to apply tests which have some certainty of meaning and are capable of
objective application and which do not so much depend as before upon the
idiosyncrasies and sensitivities of the tribunal of fact, whether judge or
jury.  We are now concerned with a Canadian statute which is exclusive of all
others.

 

                   Any doubt that
s. 163(8)  was intended to provide an exhaustive test of obscenity was
settled in Dechow v. The Queen, supra.  Laskin C.J. stated (at p.
962):

 

                   I
am not only satisfied to regard s. 159(8) [now s. 163(8) ] as
prescribing an exhaustive test of obscenity in respect of a publication which
has sex as a theme or characteristic but I am also of the opinion that this
Court should apply that test in respect of other provisions of the Code,
such as ss. 163  and 164 , in cases in which the allegation of obscenity
revolves around sex considerations.  Since the view that I take, in line with
that expressed by Judson J. in the Brodie case, is that the Hicklin
rule has been displaced by s. 159(8) in respect of publications, I would
not bring it back under any other sections of the Code, such as
ss. 159 , 163  and 164 , to provide a back‑up where a sexual theme or
sexual factors are the basis upon which obscenity charges are laid and the
charges fail because the test prescribed by s. 159(8) has not been met.

 

                   In the Dechow
case, the majority ascribed a liberal meaning to the term
""publication"", and found that the sex devices in question were
""publications"" as the accused had made such objects ""publicly
known"" and had produced and issued such articles for public sale. 
Furthermore in Germain v. The Queen, supra, La Forest J., with
whom a majority of the Court agreed on this point, held that the word
""obscene"" must be given the same meaning whether the articles are
publications under s. 159(1) (now s. 163(1) ) or matter covered by
s. 159(2) (a) (now s. 163(2) (a)).  As a consequence, it
is now beyond dispute that s. 163(8)  provides the exhaustive test of
obscenity with respect to publications and objects which exploit sex as a
dominant characteristic and that the common law test of obscenity found in the Hicklin
decision is no longer applicable.

 

                   (b)  Tests
of ""Undue Exploitation of Sex""

 

                   In order for the
work or material to qualify as ""obscene"", the exploitation of sex
must not only be its dominant characteristic, but such exploitation must be
""undue"".  In determining when the exploitation of sex will be
considered ""undue"", the courts have attempted to formulate workable
tests.  The most important of these is the ""community standard of
tolerance"" test.

 

                   i)  ""Community
Standard of Tolerance"" Test

 

                   In Brodie,
Judson J. accepted the view espoused notably by the Australian and New Zealand
courts that obscenity is to be measured against ""community
standards"".  He cited, at pp. 705-6, the following passage in the judgment
of Fullager J. in R. v. Close, [1948] V.L.R. 445, at p. 465:

 

                   There
does exist in any community at all times ‑‑ however the standard
may vary from time to time ‑‑ a general instinctive sense of what
is decent and what is indecent, of what is clean and what is dirty, and when
the distinction has to be drawn, I do not know that today there is any better
tribunal than a jury to draw it . . .  I am very far from attempting to lay
down a model direction, but a judge might perhaps, in the case of a novel, say
something like this:  ""It would not be true to say that any publication
dealing with sexual relations is obscene.  The relations of the sexes are, of
course, legitimate matters for discussion everywhere . . .  There are certain
standards of decency which prevail in the community, and you are really called
upon to try this case because you are regarded as representing, and capable of
justly applying, those standards.  What is obscene is something which offends
against those standards.""

 

                   The community
standards test has been the subject of extensive judicial analysis.  It is the
standards of the community as a whole which must be considered and not the
standards of a small segment of that community such as the university community
where a film was shown (R. v. Goldberg, [1971] 3 O.R. 323 (C.A.)) or a
city where a picture was exposed (R. v. Kiverago (1973), 11 C.C.C. (2d)
463 (Ont. C.A.)).  The standard to be applied is a national one (R. v.
Cameron (1966), 58 D.L.R. (2d) 486 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Duthie Books Ltd.
(1966), 58 D.L.R. (2d) 274 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Ariadne Developments Ltd.
(1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 49 (N.S.S.C., App. Div.), at p. 59).  With respect to
expert evidence, it is not necessary and is not a fact which the Crown is
obliged to prove as part of its case (R. v. Sudbury News Service Ltd.
(1978), 18 O.R. (2d) 428 (C.A.); R. v. Prairie Schooner News Ltd.
(1970), 75 W.W.R. 585 (Man. C.A.); R. v. Great West News Ltd., [1970] 4
C.C.C. 307 (Man. C.A.)).  In R. v. Dominion News & Gifts (1962) Ltd.,
[1963] 2 C.C.C. 103 (Man. C.A.), Freedman J.A. (dissenting) emphasized that the
community standards test must necessarily respond to changing mores (at pp.
116-17):

 

                   Community
standards must be contemporary.  Times change, and ideas change with them. 
Compared to the Victorian era this is a liberal age in which we live.  One
manifestation of it is the relative freedom with which the whole question of
sex is discussed.  In books, magazines, movies, television, and sometimes even
in parlour conversation, various aspects of sex are made the subject of
comment, with a candour that in an earlier day would have been regarded as
indecent and intolerable.  We cannot and should not ignore these present‑day
attitudes when we face the question whether [the subject materials] are obscene
according to our criminal law.

 

                   Our Court was
called upon to elaborate the community standards test in Towne Cinema
Theatres Ltd. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 494. Dickson C.J. reviewed the
case law and found (at pp. 508-9):

 

                   The
cases all emphasize that it is a standard of tolerance, not taste, that
is relevant.  What matters is not what Canadians think is right for themselves
to see.  What matters is what Canadians would not abide other Canadians seeing
because it would be beyond the contemporary Canadian standard of tolerance to
allow them to see it.

 

                   Since
the standard is tolerance, I think the audience to which the allegedly obscene
material is targeted must be relevant.  The operative standards are those of
the Canadian community as a whole, but since what matters is what other people
may see, it is quite conceivable that the Canadian community would tolerate
varying degrees of explicitness depending upon the audience and the
circumstances.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

                   Therefore, the
community standards test is concerned not with what Canadians would not
tolerate being exposed to themselves, but what they would not tolerate other
Canadians being exposed to.  The minority view was that the tolerance level
will vary depending on the manner, time and place in which the material is
presented as well as the audience to whom it is directed.  The majority opinion
on this point was expressed by Wilson J. in the following passage, at p. 521:

 

It
is not, in my opinion, open to the courts under s. 159(8)  of the Criminal
Code  to characterize a movie as obscene if shown to one constituency but
not if shown to another . . . .  In my view, a movie is either obscene under
the Code based on a national community standard of tolerance or it is not. 
If it is not, it may still be the subject of provincial regulatory control.

 

                   ii)  ""Degradation
or Dehumanization"" Test

 

                   There has been a
growing recognition in recent cases that material which may be said to exploit
sex in a ""degrading or dehumanizing"" manner will necessarily fail the
community standards test.  Borins Co. Ct. J. expressed this view in R. v.
Doug Rankine Co. (1983), 9 C.C.C. (3d) 53 (Ont. Co. Ct.), at p.
70:

 

. .
. films which consist substantially or partially of scenes which portray violence
and cruelty in conjunction with sex, particularly where the performance of
indignities degrade and dehumanize the people upon whom they are performed,
exceed the level of community tolerance.

 

                   Subsequent
decisions, such as R. v. Ramsingh (1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d) 230 (Man. Q.B.)
and  R. v. Wagner (1985), 43 C.R. (3d) 318 (Alta. Q.B.) held that
material that ""degraded"" or ""dehumanized"" any of the
participants would exceed community standards even in the absence of cruelty
and violence.  In R. v. Ramsingh, supra, Ferg J. described in
graphic terms the type of material that qualified for this label.  He states on
p. 239:

 

They
are exploited, portrayed as desiring pleasure from pain, by being humiliated
and treated only as an object of male domination sexually, or in cruel or
violent bondage.  Women are portrayed in these films as pining away their lives
waiting for a huge male penis to come along, on the person of a so‑called
sex therapist, or window washer, supposedly to transport them into complete
sexual ecstasy.  Or even more false and degrading one is led to believe their
raison d'être is to savour semen as a life elixir, or that they secretly desire
to be forcefully taken by a male.

 

                   Among other things,
degrading or dehumanizing materials place women (and sometimes men) in
positions of subordination, servile submission or humiliation.  They run
against the principles of equality and dignity of all human beings.  In the
appreciation of whether material is degrading or dehumanizing, the appearance
of consent is not necessarily determinative.  Consent cannot save materials
that otherwise contain degrading or dehumanizing scenes.  Sometimes the very
appearance of consent makes the depicted acts even more degrading or
dehumanizing.

 

                   This type of
material would, apparently, fail the community standards test not because it
offends against morals but because it is perceived by public opinion to be
harmful to society, particularly to women.  While the accuracy of this
perception is not susceptible of exact proof, there is a substantial body of
opinion that holds that the portrayal of persons being subjected to degrading
or dehumanizing sexual treatment results in harm, particularly to women and therefore
to society as a whole.  See Wagner, supra, at p. 336.  See
also:  Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (the ""Meese
Commission""), Final Report (U.S., 1986), vol. 1, at
pp. 938‑1035; Metro Toronto Task Force on Public Violence Against
Women and Children, Final Report (1984), at p. 66; Report of the
Joint Select Committee on Video Material (Australia, 1988), at pp. 185‑230;
Pornography:  Report of the Ministerial Committee of Inquiry into
Pornography (New Zealand, 1988), at pp. 38‑45.  It would be
reasonable to conclude that there is an appreciable risk of harm to society in
the portrayal of such material.  The effect of the evidence on public opinion
was summed up by Wilson J. in Towne Cinema, supra, at p. 524, as
follows:

 

The
most that can be said, I think, is that the public has concluded that exposure
to material which degrades the human dimensions of life to a subhuman or merely
physical dimension and thereby contributes to a process of moral
desensitization must be harmful in some way.

 

                   In Towne Cinema,
Dickson C.J. considered the ""degradation"" or
""dehumanization"" test to be the principal indicator of
""undueness"" without specifying what role the community tolerance test
plays in respect of this issue.  He did observe, however, that the community
might tolerate some forms of exploitation that caused harm that were
nevertheless undue.  The relevant passages appear at p. 505:

 

                   There
are other ways in which exploitation of sex might be ""undue"".  Ours
is not a perfect society and it is unfortunate but true that the community may
tolerate publications that cause harm to members of society and therefore to
society as a whole.  Even if, at certain times, there is a coincidence between
what is not tolerated and what is harmful to society, there is no necessary
connection between these two concepts.  Thus, a legal definition of
""undue"" must also encompass publications harmful to members of
society and, therefore, to society as a whole.

 

                   Sex
related publications which portray persons in a degrading manner as objects of
violence, cruelty or other forms of dehumanizing treatment, may be
""undue"" for the purpose of s. 159(8) .  No one should be subject
to the degradation and humiliation inherent in publications which link sex with
violence, cruelty, and other forms of dehumanizing treatment.  It is not likely
that at a given moment in a society's history, such publications will be
tolerated . . . .

 

                   However,
as I have noted above, there is no necessary coincidence between the
undueness of publications which degrade people by linking violence, cruelty or
other forms of dehumanizing treatment with sex, and the community standard of
tolerance.  Even if certain sex related materials were found to be within the
standard of tolerance of the community, it would still be necessary to ensure
that they were not ""undue"" in some other sense, for example in the
sense that they portray persons in a degrading manner as objects of violence,
cruelty, or other forms of dehumanizing treatment.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

                   In the reasons of
Wilson J. concurring in the result, the line between the mere portrayal of sex
and the dehumanization of people is drawn by the ""undueness""
concept.  The community is the arbiter as to what is harmful to it.  She
states, at p. 524:

 

                   As
I see it, the essential difficulty with the definition of obscenity is that
""undueness"" must presumably be assessed in relation to consequences. 
It is implicit in the definition that at some point the exploitation of sex
becomes harmful to the public or at least the public believes that to be so. 
It is therefore necessary for the protection of the public to put limits on the
degree of exploitation and, through the application of the community standard
test, the public is made the arbiter of what is harmful to it and what is not. 
The problem is that we know so little of the consequences we are seeking to
avoid.  Do obscene movies spawn immoral conduct?  Do they degrade women?  Do
they promote violence?  The most that can be said, I think, is that the public
has concluded that exposure to material which degrades the human dimensions of
life to a subhuman or merely physical dimension and thereby contributes to a
process of moral desensitization must be harmful in some way.  It must
therefore be controlled when it gets out of hand, when it becomes
""undue"". 

 

                   iii)  ""Internal
Necessities Test"" or ""Artistic Defence""

 

                   In determining
whether the exploitation of sex is ""undue"", Judson J. set out the
test of ""internal necessities"" in Brodie, supra, at pp.
704-5:

 

What
I think is aimed at is excessive emphasis on the theme for a base purpose.  But
I do not think that there is undue exploitation if there is no more emphasis on
the theme than is required in the serious treatment of the theme of a novel
with honesty and uprightness.  That the work under attack is a serious work of
fiction is to me beyond question.  It has none of the characteristics that are
often described in judgments dealing with obscenity ‑‑ dirt for
dirt's sake, the leer of the sensualist, depravity in the mind of an author
with an obsession for dirt, pornography, an appeal to a prurient interest,
etc.  The section recognizes that the serious‑minded author must have
freedom in the production of a work of genuine artistic and literary merit and
the quality of the work, as the witnesses point out and common sense indicates,
must have real relevance in determining not only a dominant characteristic but
also whether there is undue exploitation.

 

                   As counsel for the
Crown pointed out in his oral submissions, the artistic defence is the last
step in the analysis of whether the exploitation of sex is undue.  Even
material which by itself offends community standards will not be considered
""undue"", if it is required for the serious treatment of a theme.  For
example, in R. v. Odeon Morton Theatres Ltd. (1974), 16 C.C.C. (2d) 185,
the majority of the Manitoba Court of Appeal held that the film ""Last
Tango in Paris"" was not obscene within the meaning of the Code.  To
determine whether a dominant characteristic of the film is the undue
exploitation of sex, Freedman C.J.M. noted that the courts must have regard to
various things -‑ the author's artistic purpose, the manner in which he
or she has portrayed and developed the story, the depiction and interplay of
character and the creation of visual effect through skilful camera techniques
(at p. 194).  Freedman C.J.M. stated that the issue of whether the film is
obscene must be determined according to contemporary community standards in
Canada.  Relevant to that determination were several factors:  the testimony of
experts, the classification of ""Restricted"" which made the film
unavailable to persons under 18 years of age and the fact that the film had
passed the scrutiny of the censor boards of several provinces.

 

                   Accordingly, the
""internal necessities"" test, or what has been referred to as the
""artistic defence"", has been interpreted to assess whether the
exploitation of sex has a justifiable role in advancing the plot or the theme,
and in considering the work as a whole, does not merely represent ""dirt
for dirt's sake"" but has a legitimate role when measured by the internal
necessities of the work itself.

 

                   (iv)  The
relationship of the tests to each other

 

                   This review of
jurisprudence shows that it fails to specify the relationship of the tests one
to another.  Failure to do so with respect to the community standards test and
the degrading or dehumanizing test, for example, raises a serious question as
to the basis on which the community acts in determining whether the impugned
material will be tolerated.  With both these tests being applied to the same
material and apparently independently, we do not know whether the community
found the material to be intolerable because it was degrading or dehumanizing,
because it offended against morals or on some other basis.  In some
circumstances a finding that the material is tolerable can be overruled by the
conclusion by the court that it causes harm and is therefore undue.  Moreover,
is the internal necessities test dominant so that it will redeem material that
would otherwise be undue or is it just one factor?  Is this test applied by the
community or is it determined by the court without regard for the community? 
This hiatus in the jurisprudence has left the legislation open to attack on the
ground of vagueness and uncertainty.  That attack is made in this case.  This
lacuna in the interpretation of the legislation must, if possible, be filled
before subjecting the legislation to Charter  scrutiny.  The necessity to
do so was foreseen by Wilson J. in Towne Cinema when she stated, at p.
525:

 

                   The
test of the community standard is helpful to the extent that it provides a norm
against which impugned material may be assessed but it does little to elucidate
the underlying question as to why some exploitation of sex falls on the
permitted side of the line under s. 159(8)  and some on the prohibited
side.  No doubt this question will have to be addressed when the validity of
the obscenity provisions of the Code is subjected to attack as an
infringement on freedom of speech and the infringement is sought to be
justified as reasonable.

 

                   Pornography can be
usefully divided into three categories:  (1) explicit sex with violence, (2)
explicit sex without violence but which subjects people to treatment that is
degrading or dehumanizing, and (3) explicit sex without violence that is
neither degrading nor dehumanizing.  Violence in this context includes both
actual physical violence and threats of physical violence.  Relating these
three categories to the terms of s. 163(8) of the Code, the first,
explicit sex coupled with violence, is expressly mentioned.  Sex coupled with
crime, horror or cruelty will sometimes involve violence.  Cruelty, for
instance, will usually do so.  But, even in the absence of violence, sex
coupled with crime, horror or cruelty may fall within the second category.  As
for category (3), subject to the exception referred to below, it is not
covered.

 

                   Some segments of
society would consider that all three categories of pornography cause harm to
society because they tend to undermine its moral fibre.  Others would contend
that none of the categories cause harm.  Furthermore there is a range of
opinion as to what is degrading or dehumanizing.  See Pornography and
Prostitution in Canada:  Report of the Special Committee on Pornography and
Prostitution (1985) (the Fraser Report), vol. 1, at p. 51. 
Because this is not a matter that is susceptible of proof in the traditional
way and because we do not wish to leave it to the individual tastes of judges,
we must have a norm that will serve as an arbiter in determining what amounts
to an undue exploitation of sex.  That arbiter is the community as a whole.

 

                   The courts must
determine as best they can what the community would tolerate others being
exposed to on the basis of the degree of harm that may flow from such
exposure.  Harm in this context means that it predisposes persons to act in an
anti‑social manner as, for example, the physical or mental mistreatment
of women by men, or, what is perhaps debatable, the reverse.  Anti‑social
conduct for this purpose is conduct which society formally recognizes as
incompatible with its proper functioning.  The stronger the inference of a risk
of harm the lesser the likelihood of tolerance.  The inference may be drawn
from the material itself or from the material and other evidence.  Similarly
evidence as to the community standards is desirable but not essential.

 

                   In making this
determination with respect to the three categories of pornography referred to
above, the portrayal of sex coupled with violence will almost always constitute
the undue exploitation of sex.  Explicit sex which is degrading or dehumanizing
may be undue if the risk of harm is substantial.  Finally, explicit sex that is
not violent and neither degrading nor dehumanizing is generally tolerated in
our society and will not qualify as the undue exploitation of sex unless it
employs children in its production.

 

                   If material is not
obscene under this framework, it does not become so by reason of the person to
whom it is or may be shown or exposed nor by reason of the place or manner in
which it is shown.  The availability of sexually explicit materials in theatres
and other public places is subject to regulation by competent provincial
legislation.  Typically such legislation imposes restrictions on the material
available to children.  See Nova Scotia Board of Censors v. McNeil,
[1978] 2 S.C.R. 662.

 

                   The foregoing deals
with the interrelationship of the ""community standards test"" and
""the degrading or dehumanizing"" test.  How does the ""internal
necessities"" test fit into this scheme?  The need to apply this test only
arises if a work contains sexually explicit material that by itself would
constitute the undue exploitation of sex.  The portrayal of sex must then be
viewed in context to determine whether that is the dominant theme of the work
as a whole.  Put another way, is undue exploitation of sex the main object of
the work or is this portrayal of sex essential to a wider artistic, literary,
or other similar purpose?  Since the threshold determination must be made on
the basis of community standards, that is, whether the sexually explicit aspect
is undue, its impact when considered in context must be determined on the same
basis.  The court must determine whether the sexually explicit material when
viewed in the context of the whole work would be tolerated by the community as
a whole.  Artistic expression rests at the heart of freedom of expression
values and any doubt in this regard must be resolved in favour of freedom of
expression.

 

C.  Does s. 163
Violate s. 2(b) of the Charter?

 

                   The majority of the
Court of Appeal in this case allowed the appeal of the Crown on the ground that
s. 163  does not violate freedom of expression as guaranteed under
s. 2 (b) of the Charter .  Huband J.A. applied the first step
of the test set out in Irwin Toy, supra, as follows (at p. 230):

 

                   In
this case, it is unnecessary to proceed beyond the first step because the
materials are devoid of a ""meaning"".  That word, as it is employed in
the majority reasons in the Irwin Toy case, leads to the realm of ideas,
opinions, thoughts, beliefs, or feelings.  Expression for economic purposes is
included because commercial expression conveys meaning.  But the majority
judgment in the Irwin Toy case acknowledges that "". . . some
human activity is purely physical and does not convey or attempt to convey
meaning"".  I think that is true of the materials in this case. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   In my view, the
majority of the Manitoba Court of Appeal erred in several respects in its
application of the test enunciated in Irwin Toy.  First, Huband J.A.
misinterpreted the distinction between purely physical activity and activity
having expressive content.  The subject matter of the materials in this case is
clearly ""physical"", but this does not mean that the materials do not
convey or attempt to convey meaning such that they are without expressive
content.  An example of the ""purely physical"" activity alluded to in Irwin
Toy was that of parking a car which, if performed as a day‑to‑day
task, cannot be said to have expressive content.  Such purely physical activity
may be distinguished from that form of activity which we are concerned with in
the present appeal which, while indeed ""physical"", conveys ideas,
opinions, or feelings.  As Twaddle J.A. noted, at pp. 237-38:

 

                   The
subject matter of the material under review . . . is sexual activity.  Such
activity is part of the human experience . . . .  The depiction of such
activity has the potential of titillating some and of informing others.  How
can images which have such effect be meaningless?  . . .

 

                   In
my view, the content of a video movie, the content of a magazine and the
imagery of a sexual gadget are all within the freedom of expression.

 

                   Second, the
majority of the Court of Appeal erred in failing to properly draw the
distinction between the content of the materials and the form of expression. 
Huband J.A. wrote, at p. 230:

 

                   Concerning
the form of the activity, it falls within an area which has been criminalized
as an offence relating to public morality ‑‑ an area identified by
Lamer J. in his reasons for decision in Reference re ss. 193 and
195.1(1)(c), supra, as one where the form might well be unprotected by the
Charter .  The form consists of the undue exploitation of sex, the
degradation of human sexuality.  In my view, the form of the activity is not
one which the Charter  was designed or intended to protect.  Thus, in terms
of both content and form the activity properly falls within the regulated area
of freedom of expression.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   The form of
activity in this case is the medium through which the meaning sought to be
conveyed is expressed, namely, the film, magazine, written matter, or sexual
gadget.  There is nothing inherently violent in the vehicle of expression, and
it accordingly does not fall outside the protected sphere of activity.

 

                   In light of our
recent decision in R. v. Keegstra, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697, the
respondent, and most of the parties intervening in support of the respondent,
do not take issue with the proposition that s. 163  of the Criminal Code 
violates s. 2 (b) of the Charter .  In Keegstra, we
were unanimous in advocating a generous approach to the protection afforded by
s. 2 (b) of the Charter .  Our Court confirmed the view
expressed in Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code
(Man.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123 (the ""Prostitution
Reference""), that activities cannot be excluded from the scope of the
guaranteed freedom on the basis of the content or meaning being conveyed. 
McLachlin J. wrote, at p. 828:

 

As this
Court has repeatedly affirmed, the content of a statement cannot deprive it of
the protection accorded by s. 2 (b), no matter how offensive it may
be.  The content of Mr. Keegstra's statements was offensive and demeaning
in the extreme; nevertheless, on the principles affirmed by this Court, that
alone would appear not to deprive them of the protection guaranteed by the Charter .

 

                   With respect, the
majority of the Court of Appeal did not sufficiently distance itself from the
content of the materials.  In assessing the purpose of the legislation, the
majority stated, at pp. 230-31:

 

                   The
purpose of s. 163 of the Code is not to interfere with the free
exchange of ideas and opinions, and not to suppress the attempt to convey a
message or a meaning.  The intent of the legislation is to bar the distribution
or sale of prurient materials devoid of a redeeming meaning.

 

                   Meaning sought to
be expressed need not be ""redeeming"" in the eyes of the court to
merit the protection of s. 2 (b), whose purpose is to ensure that
thoughts and feelings may be conveyed freely in non‑violent ways without
fear of censure.

 

                   In this case, both
the purpose and effect of s. 163  are specifically to restrict the
communication of certain types of materials based on their content.  In my
view, there is no doubt that s. 163  seeks to prohibit certain types of
expressive activity and thereby infringes s. 2 (b) of the Charter .

 

                   Before turning to
consider whether this infringement is justified under s. 1  of the Charter ,
I wish to address the argument advanced by the Attorney General of B.C. that in
applying s. 2 (b), a distinction should be made between films and
written works.  It is argued that by its very nature, the medium of the written
word is such that it is, when used, inherently an attempt to convey meaning. 
In contrast, British Columbia argues that the medium of film can be used for a
purpose ""not significantly communicative"".  In its factum, British
Columbia maintains that if the activity captured in hard core pornographic
magazines and videotapes is itself not expression, the fact that they are
reproduced by the technology of a camera does not magically transform them into
""expression"":  the appellant cannot hide behind the label
""film"" to claim protection for the reproduction of activity the sole
purpose of which is to arouse or shock.

 

                   In my view, this
submission cannot be maintained.  This position is not far from that taken by
the majority of the Court of Appeal, that the depiction of purely physical
activity does not convey meaning.  First, I cannot agree with the premise that
purely physical activity, such as sexual activity, cannot be expression. 
Second, in creating a film, regardless of its content, the maker of the film is
consciously choosing the particular images which together constitute the film. 
In choosing his or her images, the creator of the film is attempting to convey
some meaning.  The meaning to be ascribed to the work cannot be measured by the
reaction of the audience, which, in some cases, may amount to no more than
physical arousal or shock.  Rather, the meaning of the work derives from the
fact that it has been intentionally created by its author.  To use an example,
it may very well be said that a blank wall in itself conveys no meaning. 
However, if one deliberately chooses to capture that image by the medium of
film, the work necessarily has some meaning for its author and thereby
constitutes expression.  The same would apply to the depiction of persons
engaged in purely sexual activity.

 

                   I would conclude that
the first constitutional question should be answered in the affirmative.

 

D.  Is s. 163 Justified Under
s. 1 of the Charter?

 

                   (a)  Is
s. 163 a Limit Prescribed by Law?

 

                   The appellant
argues that the provision is so vague that it is impossible to apply it. 
Vagueness must be considered in relation to two issues in this appeal:  (1) is
the law so vague that it does not qualify as ""a limit prescribed by
law""; and (2) is it so imprecise that it is not a reasonable limit. 
Dealing with (1), the test is whether the law ""is so obscure as to be
incapable of interpretation with any degree of precision using the ordinary
tools"" (Osborne v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 69, at
p. 94).  Put another way, does the law provide ""an intelligible
standard according to which the judiciary must do its work"" (Irwin Toy,
supra, at p. 983; adopted in Osborne v. Canada (Treasury Board),
supra, at p. 96).

 

                   In assessing
whether s. 163(8)  prescribes an intelligible standard, consideration must
be given to the manner in which the provision has been judicially interpreted. 
Accordingly, in the Prostitution Reference, supra, the majority
reached the conclusion that words such as ""acts of indecency"" were
capable of constituting a limit prescribed by law.  Lamer J. (as he then was)
stated, at p. 1157:

 

Also,
as the Ontario Court of Appeal has held in R. v. LeBeau (1988), 41
C.C.C. (3d) 163, at p. 173, ""the void for vagueness doctrine is not
to be applied to the bare words of the statutory provision but, rather, to the
provision as interpreted and applied in judicial decisions"".

 

                   The
fact that a particular legislative term is open to varying interpretations by
the courts is not fatal.  As Beetz J. observed in R. v. Morgentaler,
[1988] 1 S.C.R. 30, at p. 107, ""[f]lexibility and vagueness are
not synonymous"".  Therefore the question at hand is whether the impugned
sections of the Criminal Code  can be or have been given sensible
meanings by the courts.

 

                   Standards which
escape precise technical definition, such as ""undue"", are an
inevitable part of the law.  The Criminal Code  contains other such
standards.  Without commenting on their constitutional validity, I note that
the terms ""indecent"", ""immoral"" or ""scurrilous"",
found in ss. 167 , 168 , 173  and 175 , are nowhere defined in the Code. 
It is within the role of the judiciary to attempt to interpret these terms.  If
such interpretation yields an intelligible standard, the threshold test for the
application of s. 1  is met.  In my opinion, the interpretation of
s. 163(8)  in prior judgments which I have reviewed, as supplemented by
these reasons, provides an intelligible standard.

 

                   (b)  Objective

 

                   The respondent
argues that there are several pressing and substantial objectives which justify
overriding the freedom to distribute obscene materials.  Essentially, these
objectives are the avoidance of harm resulting from antisocial attitudinal
changes that exposure to obscene material causes and the public interest in
maintaining a ""decent society"".  On the other hand, the appellant
argues that the objective of s. 163 is to have the state act as
""moral custodian"" in sexual matters and to impose subjective
standards of morality.

 

                   The obscenity
legislation and jurisprudence prior to the enactment of s. 163 were
evidently concerned with prohibiting the ""immoral influences"" of
obscene publications and safeguarding the morals of individuals into whose
hands such works could fall.  The Hicklin philosophy posits that explicit
sexual depictions, particularly outside the sanctioned contexts of marriage and
procreation, threatened the morals or the fabric of society (Clare Beckton,
""Freedom of Expression (s. 2(b))"", in Tarnopolsky and
Beaudoin (eds.), The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms :  Commentary
(1982), at p. 105.  In this sense, its dominant, if not exclusive, purpose
was to advance a particular conception of morality.  Any deviation from such
morality was considered to be inherently undesirable, independently of any harm
to society.  As Judson J. described the test in Brodie, supra, at
pp. 704-5:

 

[The
work under attack] has none of the characteristics that are often described in
judgments dealing with obscenity ‑‑ dirt for dirt's sake, the leer
of the sensualist, depravity in the mind of an author with an obsession for
dirt, pornography, an appeal to a prurient interest, etc.

 

                   I agree with
Twaddle J.A. of the Court of Appeal that this particular objective is no longer
defensible in view of the Charter .  To impose a certain standard of
public and sexual morality, solely because it reflects the conventions of a
given community, is inimical to the exercise and enjoyment of individual
freedoms, which form the basis of our social contract.  D. Dyzenhaus,
""Obscenity and the Charter :  Autonomy and Equality"" (1991), 1
C.R. (4th) 367, at p. 370, refers to this as ""legal
moralism"", of a majority deciding what values should inform individual
lives and then coercively imposing those values on minorities.  The prevention
of ""dirt for dirt's sake"" is not a legitimate objective which would
justify the violation of one of the most fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Charter .

 

                   On the other hand,
I cannot agree with the suggestion of the appellant that Parliament does not
have the right to legislate on the basis of some fundamental conception of
morality for the purposes of safeguarding the values which are integral to a
free and democratic society.  As Dyzenhaus, supra, at p. 376, writes:

 

Moral
disapprobation is recognized as an appropriate response when it has its basis
in Charter  values.

 

                   As the respondent
and many of the interveners have pointed out, much of the criminal law is based
on moral conceptions of right and wrong and the mere fact that a law is
grounded in morality does not automatically render it illegitimate.  In this
regard, criminalizing the proliferation of materials which undermine another
basic Charter  right may indeed be a legitimate objective.

 

                   In my view,
however, the overriding objective of s. 163 is not moral disapprobation
but the avoidance of harm to society.  In Towne Cinema, Dickson
C.J. stated, at p. 507:

 

It
is harm to society from undue exploitation that is aimed at by the section, not
simply lapses in propriety or good taste. 

 

                   The harm was
described in the following way in the Report on Pornography by the Standing
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs (MacGuigan Report) (1978), at p. 18:4:

 

                   The
clear and unquestionable danger of this type of material is that it reinforces
some unhealthy tendencies in Canadian society.  The effect of this type of
material is to reinforce male‑female stereotypes to the detriment of both
sexes.  It attempts to make degradation, humiliation, victimization, and
violence in human relationships appear normal and acceptable.  A society which
holds that egalitarianism, non‑violence, consensualism, and mutuality are
basic to any human interaction, whether sexual or other, is clearly justified
in controlling and prohibiting any medium of depiction, description or advocacy
which violates these principles.

 

                   The appellant
argues that to accept the objective of the provision as being related to the
harm associated with obscenity would be to adopt the ""shifting
purpose"" doctrine explicitly rejected in R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.,
[1985] 1 S.C.R. 295.  This Court concluded in that case that a finding that the
Lord's Day Act has a secular purpose was not possible given that its
religious purpose, in compelling sabbatical observance, has been long‑established
and consistently maintained by the courts.  The appellant relies on the words
of Dickson J. (as he then was), at pp. 335-36:

 

. .
. the theory of a shifting purpose stands in stark contrast to fundamental
notions developed in our law concerning the nature of ""Parliamentary
intention"".  Purpose is a function of the intent of those who drafted and
enacted the legislation at the time, and not of any shifting variable.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   While
the effect of such legislation as the Lord's Day Act may be more secular
today than it was in 1677 or in 1906, such a finding cannot justify a
conclusion that its purpose has similarly changed.  In result, therefore, the Lord's
Day Act must be characterized as it has always been, a law the primary
purpose of which is the compulsion of sabbatical observance.

 

                   I do not agree that
to identify the objective of the impugned legislation as the prevention of harm
to society, one must resort to the ""shifting purpose"" doctrine. 
First, the notions of moral corruption and harm to society are not distinct, as
the appellant suggests, but are inextricably linked.  It is moral corruption of
a certain kind which leads to the detrimental effect on society.  Second, and
more importantly, I am of the view that with the enactment of s. 163,
Parliament explicitly sought to address the harms which are linked to certain
types of obscene materials.  The prohibition of such materials was based on a
belief that they had a detrimental impact on individuals exposed to them and consequently
on society as a whole.  Our understanding of the harms caused by these
materials has developed considerably since that time; however this does not
detract from the fact that the purpose of this legislation remains, as it was
in 1959, the protection of society from harms caused by the exposure to obscene
materials.  In this regard, I lend support to the analysis of Charron Dist. Ct.
J. in R. v. Fringe Product Inc., supra, at p. 443:

 

Even
though one can still find an emphasis on the enforcement of moral standards of
decency in relation to expression in sexual matters in the jurisprudence
subsequent to the enactment of s‑s.(8), it is clear that, by the very
words it has chosen, Parliament in 1959 moved beyond such narrow concern and
expanded the scope of the legislation to include further concerns with respect
to sex combined with crime, horror, cruelty and violence.

 

                   It
is the harm to society resulting from the undue exploitation of such matters
which is aimed by the section.  The ""harm"" conceived by Parliament in
1959 may not have been expressed in the same words as one would today.  The
court is not limited to a 1959 perspective in the determination of this
matter.  As noted in Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney‑General), supra,
at p. 618:

 

In
showing that the legislation pursues a pressing and substantial objective, it
is not open to the government to assert post facto a purpose which did
not animate the legislation in the first place . . .  However, in proving that
the original objective remains pressing and substantial, the government surely
can and should draw upon the best evidence currently available.  The same is
true as regards proof that the measure is proportional to its objective . . . 
It is equally possible that a purpose which was not demonstrably pressing and
substantial at the time of the legislative enactment becomes demonstrably
pressing and substantial with the passing of time and the changing of
circumstances.

 

                   In
1959, the harm to society caused by the undue exploitation of sex or of sex and
other named matters may well have been defined more strictly in terms of public
morality, i.e., that such expression offended society's sense of right
and wrong.  It may well be that if such was the only identifiable harm today
that the legislation could not be said to pertain to pressing and substantial
concerns thereby warranting an infringement of the right of expression.  But
that is not so.  The harm goes beyond public morality in this narrow sense.

 

                   A permissible shift
in emphasis was built into the legislation when, as interpreted by the courts,
it adopted the community standards test.  Community standards as to what is
harmful have changed since 1959.

 

                   This being the
objective, is it pressing and substantial?  Does the prevention of the harm
associated with the dissemination of certain obscene materials constitute a
sufficiently pressing and substantial concern to warrant a restriction on the
freedom of expression?  In this regard, it should be recalled that in Keegstra,
supra, this Court unanimously accepted that the prevention of the
influence of hate propaganda on society at large was a legitimate objective. 
Dickson C.J. wrote with respect to the changes in attitudes which exposure to
hate propaganda can bring about (at pp. 747-48):

 

. .
. the alteration of views held by the recipients of hate propaganda may occur
subtly, and is not always attendant upon conscious acceptance of the
communicated ideas.  Even if the message of hate propaganda is outwardly
rejected, there is evidence that its premise of racial or religious inferiority
may persist in a recipient's mind as an idea that holds some truth, an
incipient effect not to be entirely discounted . . . .

 

                   The
threat to the self‑dignity of target group members is thus matched by the
possibility that prejudiced messages will gain some credence, with the
attendant result of discrimination, and perhaps even violence, against minority
groups in Canadian society.

 

                   This Court has thus
recognized that the harm caused by the proliferation of materials which
seriously offend the values fundamental to our society is a substantial concern
which justifies restricting the otherwise full exercise of the freedom of
expression.  In my view, the harm sought to be avoided in the case of the
dissemination of obscene materials is similar.  In the words of Nemetz C.J.B.C.
in R. v. Red Hot Video Ltd. (1985), 45 C.R. (3d) 36 (B.C.C.A.), there is
a growing concern that the exploitation of women and children, depicted in publications
and films, can, in certain circumstances, lead to ""abject and servile
victimization"" (at pp. 43‑44).  As Anderson J.A. also noted in
that same case, if true equality between male and female persons is to be
achieved, we cannot ignore the threat to equality resulting from exposure to
audiences of certain types of violent and degrading material.  Materials
portraying women as a class as objects for sexual exploitation and abuse have a
negative impact on ""the individual's sense of self‑worth and acceptance"".

 

                   In reaching the
conclusion that legislation proscribing obscenity is a valid objective which
justifies some encroachment on the right to freedom of expression, I am
persuaded in part that such legislation may be found in most free and democratic
societies.  As Nemetz C.J.B.C. aptly pointed out in R. v. Red Hot Video,
supra, for centuries democratic societies have set certain limits to
freedom of expression.  He cited (at p. 40) the following passage of
Dickson J.A. (as he then was) in R. v. Great West News Ltd., supra,
at p. 309:

 

. .
. all organized societies have sought in one manner or another to suppress
obscenity.  The right of the state to legislate to protect its moral fibre and
well‑being has long been recognized, with roots deep in history.  It is
within this frame that the Courts and Judges must work. 

 

                   The advent of the Charter 
did not have the effect of dramatically depriving Parliament of a power which
it has historically enjoyed.  It is also noteworthy that the criminalization of
obscenity was considered to be compatible with the Canadian Bill of Rights. 
As Dickson J.A. stated in R. v. Prairie Schooner News Ltd., supra,
at p. 604:

 

Freedom
of speech is not unfettered either in criminal law or civil law.  The Canadian
Bill of Rights was intended to protect, and does protect, basic freedoms of
vital importance to all Canadians.  It does not serve as a shield behind which
obscene matter may be disseminated without concern for criminal consequences. 
The interdiction of the publications which are the subject of the present
charges in no way trenches upon the freedom of expression which the Canadian
Bill of Rights assures. 

 

                   The enactment of
the impugned provision is also consistent with Canada's international
obligations (Agreement for the Suppression of the Circulation of Obscene
Publications and the Convention for the Suppression of the Circulation
of and Traffic in Obscene Publications).

 

                   Finally, it should
be noted that the burgeoning pornography industry renders the concern even more
pressing and substantial than when the impugned provisions were first enacted. 
I would therefore conclude that the objective of avoiding the harm associated
with the dissemination of pornography in this case is sufficiently pressing and
substantial to warrant some restriction on full exercise of the right to
freedom of expression.  The analysis of whether the measure is proportional to
the objective must, in my view, be undertaken in light of the conclusion that
the objective of the impugned section is valid only in so far as it relates to
the harm to society associated with obscene materials.  Indeed, the section as
interpreted in previous decisions and in these reasons is fully consistent with
that objective.  The objective of maintaining conventional standards of
propriety, independently of any harm to society, is no longer justified in
light of the values of individual liberty which underlie the Charter .  This,
then, being the objective of s. 163 , which I have found to be pressing and
substantial, I must now determine whether the section is rationally connected
and proportional to this objective.  As outlined above, s. 163(8) 
criminalizes the exploitation of sex and sex and violence, when, on the basis
of the community test, it is undue.  The determination of when such
exploitation is undue is directly related to the immediacy of a risk of harm to
society which is reasonably perceived as arising from its dissemination.

 

                   (c)  Proportionality

 

                   (i)  General

 

                   The proportionality
requirement has three aspects:

 

                   (1)the
existence of a rational connection between the impugned measures and the
objective;

 

(2)minimal
impairment of the right or freedom; and

 

(3)a
proper balance between the effects of the limiting measures and the legislative
objective.

 

                   In assessing
whether the proportionality test is met, it is important to keep in mind the
nature of expression which has been infringed.  In the Prostitution Reference,
supra, Dickson C.J. wrote, at p. 1136:

 

When
a Charter  freedom has been infringed by state action that takes the form
of criminalization, the Crown bears the heavy burden of justifying that
infringement.  Yet, the expressive activity, as with any infringed Charter 
right, should also be analysed in the particular context of the case.  Here,
the activity to which the impugned legislation is directed is expression with
an economic purpose.  It can hardly be said that communications regarding an
economic transaction of sex for money lie at, or even near, the core of the
guarantee of freedom of expression.

 

                   The values which
underlie the protection of freedom of expression relate to the search for
truth, participation in the political process, and individual self‑fulfilment. 
The Attorney General for Ontario argues that of these, only ""individual
self‑fulfilment"", and only in its most base aspect, that of physical
arousal, is engaged by pornography.  On the other hand, the civil liberties
groups argue that pornography forces us to question conventional notions of
sexuality and thereby launches us into an inherently political discourse.  In
their factum, the B.C. Civil Liberties Association adopts a passage from
R. West, ""The Feminist‑Conservative Anti‑Pornography
Alliance and the 1986 Attorney General's Commission on Pornography Report""
(1987), 4 Am. Bar Found. Res. Jo. 681, at p. 696:

 

Good
pornography has value because it validates women's will to pleasure.  It
celebrates female nature.  It validates a range of female sexuality that is
wider and truer than that legitimated by the non‑pornographic culture. 
Pornography (when it is good) celebrates both female pleasure and male
rationality.

 

                   A proper
application of the test should not suppress what West refers to as ""good
pornography"".  The objective of the impugned provision is not to inhibit
the celebration of human sexuality.  However, it cannot be ignored that the
realities of the pornography industry are far from the picture which the B.C.
Civil Liberties Association would have us paint.  Shannon J., in R. v.
Wagner, supra, described the materials more accurately when he
observed, at p. 331:

 

Women,
particularly, are deprived of unique human character or identity and are
depicted as sexual playthings, hysterically and instantly responsive to male
sexual demands.  They worship male genitals and their own value depends upon
the quality of their genitals and breasts.

 

                   In my view, the
kind of expression which is sought to be advanced does not stand on an equal
footing with other kinds of expression which directly engage the
""core"" of the freedom of expression values.

 

                   This conclusion is
further buttressed by the fact that the targeted material is expression which
is motivated, in the overwhelming majority of cases, by economic profit.  This
Court held in Rocket v. Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 232, at p. 247, that an economic motive for expression
means that restrictions on the expression might ""be easier to justify than
other infringements"".

 

                   I will now turn to
an examination of the three basic aspects of the proportionality test.

 

                   (ii)  Rational
Connection

 

                   The message of
obscenity which degrades and dehumanizes is analogous to that of hate
propaganda.  As the Attorney General of Ontario has argued in its factum,
obscenity wields the power to wreak social damage in that a significant portion
of the population is humiliated by its gross misrepresentations.

 

                   Accordingly, the
rational link between s. 163 and the objective of Parliament relates to
the actual causal relationship between obscenity and the risk of harm to
society at large.  On this point, it is clear that the literature of the social
sciences remains subject to controversy.  In Fringe Product Inc., supra,
Charron Dist. Ct. J. considered numerous written reports and works and heard
six days of testimony from experts who endeavoured to describe the status of
the social sciences with respect to the study of the effects of pornography. 
Charron Dist. Ct. J. reached the conclusion that the relationship between
pornography and harm was sufficient to justify Parliament's intervention.  This
conclusion is not supported unanimously.

 

                   The recent
conclusions of the Fraser Report, supra, could not postulate any causal
relationship between pornography and the commission of violent crimes, the
sexual abuse of children, or the disintegration of communities and society. 
This is in contrast to the findings of the MacGuigan Report, supra.

 

                   While a direct link
between obscenity and harm to society may be difficult, if not impossible, to
establish, it is reasonable to presume that exposure to images bears a causal
relationship to changes in attitudes and beliefs.  The Meese Commission Report,
supra, concluded in respect of sexually violent material (vol. 1, at p.
326):

 

. .
. the available evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that substantial
exposure to sexually violent materials as described here bears a causal
relationship to antisocial acts of sexual violence and, for some subgroups,
possibly to unlawful acts of sexual violence.

 

                   Although
we rely for this conclusion on significant scientific empirical evidence, we
feel it worthwhile to note the underlying logic of the conclusion.  The
evidence says simply that the images that people are exposed to bears a causal
relationship to their behavior.  This is hardly surprising.  What would be
surprising would be to find otherwise, and we have not so found.  We have not,
of course, found that the images people are exposed to are a greater cause of
sexual violence than all or even many other possible causes the investigation
of which has been beyond our mandate.  Nevertheless, it would be strange indeed
if graphic representations of a form of behavior, especially in a form that
almost exclusively portrays such behavior as desirable, did not have at least
some effect on patterns of behavior.

 

                   In the face of
inconclusive social science evidence, the approach adopted by our Court in Irwin
Toy is instructive.  In that case, the basis for the legislation was that
television advertising directed at young children is per se manipulative.  The Court made it
clear, at p. 994, that in choosing its mode of intervention, it is sufficient
that Parliament had a reasonable basis:

 

                   In
the instant case, the Court is called upon to assess competing social science
evidence respecting the appropriate means for addressing the problem of
children's advertising.  The question is whether the government had a
reasonable basis, on the evidence tendered, for concluding that the ban on all
advertising directed at children impaired freedom of expression as little as
possible given the government's pressing and substantial objective. 

 

And at p. 990:

 

. .
. the Court also recognized that the government was afforded a margin of
appreciation to form legitimate objectives based on somewhat inconclusive
social science evidence.

 

                   Similarly, in Keegstra,
supra, the absence of proof of a causative link between hate propaganda
and hatred of an identifiable group was discounted as a determinative factor in
assessing the constitutionality of the hate literature provisions of the Criminal
Code .  Dickson C.J. stated, at p. 776:

 

First,
to predicate the limitation of free expression upon proof of actual hatred
gives insufficient attention to the severe psychological trauma suffered by
members of those identifiable groups targeted by hate propaganda.  Second, it
is clearly difficult to prove a causative link between a specific statement and
hatred of an identifiable group.

 

McLachlin J. (dissenting) expressed it
as follows, at p. 857:

 

To
view hate propaganda as ""victimless"" in the absence of any proof that
it moved its listeners to hatred is to discount the wrenching impact that it
may have on members of the target group themselves . . . .  Moreover, it is
simply not possible to assess with any precision the effects that expression of
a particular message will have on all those who are ultimately exposed to it.

 

                   The American
approach on the necessity of a causal link between obscenity and harm to
society was set out by Burger C.J. in Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton,
413 U.S. 49 (1972), at pp. 60-61:

 

Although
there is no conclusive proof of a connection between antisocial behavior and
obscene material, the legislature . . . could quite reasonably determine that
such a connection does or might exist.

 

                   I am in agreement
with Twaddle J.A. who expressed the view that Parliament was entitled to have a
""reasoned apprehension of harm"" resulting from the desensitization of
individuals exposed to materials which depict violence, cruelty, and dehumanization
in sexual relations.

 

                   Accordingly, I am
of the view that there is a sufficiently rational link between the criminal
sanction, which demonstrates our community's disapproval of the dissemination
of materials which potentially victimize women and which restricts the negative
influence which such materials have on changes in attitudes and behaviour, and
the objective.

 

                   Finally, I wish to
distinguish this case from Keegstra, in which the minority adopted the
view that there was no rational connection between the criminalization of hate
propaganda and its suppression.  As McLachlin J. noted, prosecutions under the Criminal
Code  for racist expression have attracted extensive media coverage.  The
criminal process confers on the accused publicity for his or her causes and
succeeds even in generating sympathy.  The same cannot be said of the kinds of
expression sought to be suppressed in the present case.  The general
availability of the subject materials and the rampant pornography industry are
such that, in the words of Dickson C.J. in Keegstra, ""pornography
is not dignified by its suppression"".  In contrast to the hate‑monger
who may succeed, by the sudden media attention, in gaining an audience, the
prohibition of obscene materials does nothing to promote the pornographer's
cause.

 

                   (iii)  Minimal
Impairment

 

                   In determining
whether less intrusive legislation may be imagined, this Court stressed in the Prostitution
Reference, supra, that it is not necessary that the legislative
scheme be the ""perfect"" scheme, but that it be appropriately tailored
in the context of the infringed right (at p. 1138).  Furthermore,
in Irwin Toy, supra, Dickson C.J., Lamer and Wilson JJ.
stated, at p. 999:

 

While
evidence exists that other less intrusive options reflecting more modest
objectives were available to the government, there is evidence establishing the
necessity of a ban to meet the objectives the government had reasonably set. 
This Court will not, in the name of minimal impairment, take a restrictive
approach to social science evidence and require legislatures to choose the
least ambitious means to protect vulnerable groups.

 

                   There are several
factors which contribute to the finding that the provision minimally impairs
the freedom which is infringed.

 

                   First, the impugned
provision does not proscribe sexually explicit erotica without violence that is
not degrading or dehumanizing.  It is designed to catch material that creates a
risk of harm to society.  It might be suggested that proof of actual harm
should be required.  It is apparent from what I have said above that it is
sufficient in this regard for Parliament to have a reasonable basis for
concluding that harm will result and this requirement does not demand actual
proof of harm.

 

                   Second, materials
which have scientific, artistic or literary merit are not captured by the
provision.  As discussed above, the court must be generous in its application
of the ""artistic defence"".  For example, in certain cases, materials
such as photographs, prints, books and films which may undoubtedly be produced
with some motive for economic profit, may nonetheless claim the protection of
the Charter  in so far as their defining characteristic is that of
aesthetic expression, and thus represent the artist's attempt at individual fulfilment. 
The existence of an accompanying economic motive does not, of itself, deprive a
work of significance as an example of individual artistic or self‑fulfilment.

 

                   Third, in
considering whether the provision minimally impairs the freedom in question, it
is legitimate for the court to take into account Parliament's past abortive
attempts to replace the definition with one that is more explicit.  In Irwin
Toy, our Court recognized that it is legitimate to take into account the
fact that earlier laws and proposed alternatives were thought to be less
effective than the legislation that is presently being challenged.  The attempt
to provide exhaustive instances of obscenity has been shown to be destined to
fail (Bill C‑54, 2nd Sess., 33rd Parl.).  It seems that the only
practicable alternative is to strive towards a more abstract definition of
obscenity which is contextually sensitive and responsive to progress in the
knowledge and understanding of the phenomenon to which the legislation is
directed.  In my view, the standard of ""undue exploitation"" is
therefore appropriate.  The intractable nature of the problem and the
impossibility of precisely defining a notion which is inherently elusive makes
the possibility of a more explicit provision remote.  In this light, it is
appropriate to question whether, and at what cost, greater legislative
precision can be demanded.

 

                   Fourth, while the
discussion in this appeal has been limited to the definition portion of
s. 163, I would note that the impugned section, with the possible
exception of subs. 1, which is not in issue here, has been held by this Court
not to extend its reach to the private use or viewing of obscene materials.  R.
v. Rioux, [1969] S.C.R. 599, [1970] 3 C.C.C. 149, unanimously upheld
the finding of the Quebec Court of Appeal that s. 163(2)  (then
s. 150(2)) does not include the private viewing of obscene materials. 
Hall J. affirmed the finding of Pratte J., at pp. 151-52 C.C.C.:

 

                   [translation] If exposing ""to
public view"" is mentioned in s‑s. (2)(a), it is because
the legislator intended that this, and not a private showing, should constitute
a crime.

 

                   I
would therefore say that showing obscene pictures to a friend or projecting an
obscene film in one's own home is not in itself a crime nor is it enough to
establish intention of circulating them nor help to prove such an intention.

 

This Court also cited with approval
the words of Hyde J., at p. 152 C.C.C.:

 

                   Before
I am prepared to hold that private use of written matter or pictures within an
individual's residence may constitute a criminal offence, I require a much more
specific text of law than we are now dealing with.  It would have been very
simple for Parliament to have included the word ""exhibit"" in this
section if it had wished to cover this situation.

 

                   Accordingly, it is
only the public distribution and exhibition of obscene materials which is in
issue here.

 

                   Finally, I wish to
address the arguments of the interveners, the Canadian Civil Liberties
Association and Manitoba Association for Rights and Liberties, that the
objectives of this kind of legislation may be met by alternative, less
intrusive measures.  First, it is submitted that reasonable time, manner and
place restrictions would be preferable to outright prohibition.  I am of the
view that this argument should be rejected.  Once it has been established that
the objective is the avoidance of harm caused by the degradation which many
women feel as ""victims"" of the message of obscenity, and of the
negative impact exposure to such material has on perceptions and attitudes
towards women, it is untenable to argue that these harms could be avoided by
placing restrictions on access to such material.  Making the materials more
difficult to obtain by increasing their cost and reducing their availability
does not achieve the same objective.  Once Parliament has reasonably concluded
that certain acts are harmful to certain groups in society and to society in
general, it would be inconsistent, if not hypocritical, to argue that such acts
could be committed in more restrictive conditions.  The harm sought to be
avoided would remain the same in either case.

 

                   It is also
submitted that there are more effective techniques to promote the objectives of
Parliament.  For example, if pornography is seen as encouraging violence
against women, there are certain activities which discourage it ‑-
counselling rape victims to charge their assailants, provision of shelter and
assistance for battered women, campaigns for laws against discrimination on the
grounds of sex, education to increase the sensitivity of law enforcement
agencies and other governmental authorities.  In addition, it is submitted that
education is an under‑used response.

 

                   It is noteworthy
that many of the above suggested alternatives are in the form of responses
to the harm engendered by negative attitudes against women.  The role of the
impugned provision is to control the dissemination of the very images that contribute
to such attitudes.  Moreover, it is true that there are additional measures
which could alleviate the problem of violence against women.  However, given
the gravity of the harm, and the threat to the values at stake, I do not
believe that the measure chosen by Parliament is equalled by the alternatives
which have been suggested.  Education, too, may offer a means of combating
negative attitudes to women, just as it is currently used as a means of
addressing other problems dealt with in the Code.  However, there is no
reason to rely on education alone.  It should be emphasized that this is in no
way intended to deny the value of other educational and counselling measures to
deal with the roots and effects of negative attitudes.  Rather, it is only to
stress the arbitrariness and unacceptability of the claim that such measures
represent the sole legitimate means of addressing the phenomenon.  Serious
social problems such as violence against women require multi‑pronged
approaches by government.  Education and legislation are not alternatives but
complements in addressing such problems.  There is nothing in the Charter 
which requires Parliament to choose between such complementary measures.

 

                   (iv)Balance
Between Effects of Limiting Measures and Legislative Objective

 

                   The final question
to be answered in the proportionality test is whether the effects of the law so
severely trench on a protected right that the legislative objective is
outweighed by the infringement.  The infringement on freedom of expression is
confined to a measure designed to prohibit the distribution of sexually
explicit materials accompanied by violence, and those without violence that are
degrading or dehumanizing.  As I have already concluded, this kind of
expression lies far from the core of the guarantee of freedom of expression. 
It appeals only to the most base aspect of individual fulfilment, and it is
primarily economically motivated.

 

                   The objective of
the legislation, on the other hand, is of fundamental importance in a free and
democratic society.  It is aimed at avoiding harm, which Parliament has
reasonably concluded will be caused directly or indirectly, to individuals,
groups such as women and children, and consequently to society as a whole, by
the distribution of these materials.  It thus seeks to enhance respect for all
members of society, and non‑violence and equality in their relations with
each other.

 

                   I therefore
conclude that the restriction on freedom of expression does not outweigh the
importance of the legislative objective.

 

5.  Conclusion

 

                   I conclude that
while s. 163(8)  infringes s. 2 (b) of the Charter ,
freedom of expression, it constitutes a reasonable limit and is saved by virtue
of the provisions of s. 1 .  The trial judge convicted the appellant only
with respect to materials which contained scenes involving violence or cruelty
intermingled with sexual activity or depicted lack of consent to sexual contact
or otherwise could be said to dehumanize men or women in a sexual context.  The
majority of the Court of Appeal, on the other hand, convicted the appellant on
all charges.

 

                   While the trial
judge concluded that the material for which the accused were acquitted was not
degrading or dehumanizing, he did so in the context of s. 1  of the Charter . 
In effect, he asked himself whether, if the material was proscribed by
s. 163(8) , that section would still be supportable under s. 1 .  In
this context, he considered the government objectives of s. 163(8)  and measured
the material which was the subject of the charges against this objective.  The
findings at trial were therefore made in a legal framework that is different
from that outlined in these reasons.  Specifically, in considering whether the
materials were degrading or dehumanizing, he did not address the issue of
harm.  Accordingly, it would be speculation to conclude that the same result
would have been obtained if the definition of obscenity contained in these
reasons had been applied.  The test applied by the majority of the Court of
Appeal also differed significantly from these reasons.  I therefore cannot
accept their conclusion that all of the materials are obscene.  Accordingly, I
would allow the appeal and direct a new trial on all charges.  I note, however,
that I am in agreement with Wright J.'s conclusion that, in the case of
material found to be obscene, there should only be one conviction imposed with
respect to a single tape.

 

                   I would answer the
constitutional questions as follows:

 

1.
Does s. 163 of the Criminal Code  of Canada, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
violate s. 2 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

                   Answer:      Yes.

 

2.                If
s. 163 of the Criminal Code  of Canada, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
violates s. 2 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ,
can s. 163  of the Criminal Code  of Canada be demonstrably justified
under s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  as a
reasonable limit prescribed by law?

 

                   Answer:      Yes.

 

//Gonthier J.//

 

                   The reasons of
L'Heureux-Dubé and Gonthier JJ. were delivered by

 

                   Gonthier J. -- I have had the benefit of
the reasons of Justice Sopinka and, while I agree both with his disposition of
the case and with his reasons generally, I wish to add to them with respect to
the judicial interpretation of s. 163  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-46 , and to its constitutional validity.

 

The Substance of s. 163 of the Code

 

                   A Representation
and its Content

 

                   Section 163 of the Code
offers a peculiar structure.  Its subject matter, obscene materials, comprises
the dual elements of representation and content.  Representation here is
understood in the sense of public suggestion.  A representation is a portrayal,
a description meant to evoke something to the mind and senses.  Furthermore, in
the context of s. 163 of the Code, one deals with representations to the
public in general, without restriction, as will be explained below.  Hence the Oxford
English Dictionary (2nd ed.) defines ""to represent"" as ""to
bring clearly and distinctly before the mind"" and
""representation"" as ""the action or fact of exhibiting in some
visible image or form"".  The element of representation in s. 163 of the Code
is therefore a suggestion, a depiction to the public.  By ""content"" I
mean of course the content of the representation.

 

                   It is the
combination of the two, the representation and its content, that attracts
criminal liability.  A representation as such is not enough, of course, to
create the subject matter of s. 163 , but neither is an act included in the
content of s. 163 of the Code, without an element of
representation.

 

                   It is indeed
important to emphasize that the Criminal Code  is grounded on the
principles of sexual freedom between consenting adults, and of criminal
liability for sexual relations between adults and minors (young persons between
the age of 14 and 17 being in a special position).  Offences such as sexual
assault (ss. 271 -73 ), sexual interference (s. 151 ), sexual exploitation (s.
153 ) or incest between an adult and a minor (s. 155 ) are corollaries of these
basic principles.  Aside from them, few offences related to sexual practices
exist: incest between adults (s. 155 of the Code), anal intercourse when
more than two persons are present (s. 159 of the Code), bestiality (s.
160 of the Code) and necrophilia (s. 182 of the Code).

 

                   Yet obscenity is
not limited to the acts described above.  Irrespective of the construction
given to s. 163(8) , a surface glance at its wording makes this obvious.  The
acts listed in the above paragraph might perhaps be included in the phrase
""sex and . . . crime, horror, cruelty and violence"" found in s.
163(8) of the Code.  They certainly do not exhaust the meaning of this
phrase, and s. 163(8)  comprises in  addition the phrase ""undue
exploitation of sex"", which is central to this case.  Hence the content of
obscenity exceeds the acts prohibited in the Code.

 

                   This difference in
content stems from the element of representation found in s. 163 of the Code. 
Parliament ascribed a broader content to obscenity because it involves a
representation.  In this combination of a given content and its representation
lies the particular essence of obscenity, as was mentioned above.  The type of
scenes vividly described in R. v. Wagner (1985), 43 C.R. (3d) 318 (Alta.
Q.B.), R. v. Doug Rankine Co. (1983), 9 C.C.C. (3d) 53 (Ont. Co. Ct.) or
R. v. Ramsingh (1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d) 230 (Man. Q.B.), might
perhaps be legal if done between consenting adults, but they become obscene
when they are represented.

 

                   Without launching
into a lengthy debate on the reasons why Parliament may have enacted s. 163 of
the Code (the reasons of Sopinka J. cover this point extensively),
it can be seen that the combination of representation and content that
constitutes obscenity leads to many ills.  Obscene materials (I will not for
reasons explained later differentiate between obscenity and pornography) convey
a distorted image of human sexuality, by making public and open elements of the
human nature which are usually hidden behind a veil of modesty and privacy.  D.
A. Downs, The New Politics of Pornography (1989), aptly describes how
these materials do not reflect the richness of human sexuality, but rather turn
it into pure animality, at p. 183:

 

. .
. the deeper objection to sheer pornography or obscenity . . . is that it
represents a retreat from the human dilemma and the responsibility of
acknowledging the tensions in our nature.  Sheer pornography also reduces us to
the lower aspects of our natures by stripping away the modesty that arises from
our encounter with our animality.

 

This distorted image of human
sexuality often comprises violence, cruelty, infliction of pain, humiliation,
among other elements of the pornographic imagery.  Not only are these materials
often evidence of the commission of reprehensible actions in their making, but
their representation conjures the possibility of behavioural influences.  In a
marketplace of ideas, to use that classic metaphor, pornographic imagery is
there for the taking, and it finds without any doubt many takers.  Attitudinal
changes in these takers, because of exposure to pornographic materials, may
lead to abuse and harm.  As the Special Committee on Pornography and
Prostitution concluded in its report entitled Pornography and Prostitution
in Canada (1985) (the ""Fraser Report"") at p. 103:

 

 . .
. there are magazines, films and videos produced solely for the purpose of
entertainment whose depiction of women in particular, but also, in some cases,
men and young people, demeans them, perpetuates lies about aspects of their
humanity and denies the validity of their aspirations to be treated as full and
equal citizens within the community.

 

These conclusions echoed those of the
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, in its Report on
Pornography (1978).

 

                   To summarize this
section, the particular combination of a representation and its content that
forms the subject matter of s. 163 of the Code was seen by Parliament as
putting forward a distorted image of human sexuality, which in turn can induce
harmful behavioural changes.  This must be kept in mind when interpreting s.
163 of the Code.

 

                   Prohibition and
Regulation

 

                   Another crucial
feature of s. 163 of the Code lies in its very presence in the Criminal
Code .  Parliament through s. 163  only prohibits, and does not regulate, the
circulation of obscene materials.  In Towne Cinema Theatres Ltd. v. The
Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 494, this Court accordingly insisted that
the audience to which a movie is shown was not relevant in deciding whether it
is obscene or not, since applying different standards to different
constituencies would bring s. 163(8)  closer to regulation than prohibition. 
Wilson J. wrote at p. 521, with the assent of the majority of this
Court:

 

It
is not, in my opinion, open to the courts under s. 159(8)  [now s. 163(8) ] of
the Criminal Code  to characterize a movie as obscene if shown to one
constituency but not if shown to another.  I do not doubt that it is desirable
to regulate the movies that can be shown to different constituencies.  A movie
which is not obscene within the meaning of the Criminal Code  may still
not be desirable viewing material for persons under the age of 18.  Such
regulation . . . is authorized in various provincial jurisdictions but it is
the regulation of material which is not obscene under the Code.

 

Sopinka J. also underscores this
point in his reasons.

 

                   In the
interpretation of s. 163(8) of the Code therefore, the impugned
materials must be presumed available to the Canadian public at large.  Any
restrictions on availability are the result of regulatory measures which fall
outside the purview of these provisions of the Criminal Code .  Obscenity
here is concerned with materials for which the mere fact of availability in the
public at large is sufficient to warrant criminal prohibition, irrespective of
in whose hands they actually fall.

 

                   The Three-Category Classification

 

                   Section 163(8)  is
the key to the identification of these materials.  In the course of his
reasons, Sopinka J. outlines the three tests that have been judicially
developed for the application of s. 163(8) , that is the ""community
standard of tolerance"", ""degradation or dehumanization"" and
""internal necessities"" tests.  He then proceeds to a progressive
restatement of the law, putting in perspective the first two tests and bringing
out the notion of harm as the central feature of s. 163(8) of the Code. 
Sopinka J. essentially aligns the definition of obscenity in s. 163(8) of
the Code with the definition of pornography nowadays.  He introduces a
three-part categorization that has surfaced in contemporary theory, and that
had been adopted in some Canadian cases throughout the 80s:

 

(a)Explicit
sex with violence, which generally constitutes ""undue exploitation of
sex"" within the meaning of s. 163(8) of the Code, on the basis of
demonstrable harm;

 

(b)Explicit
sex that is degrading or dehumanizing, which will be ""undue exploitation
of sex"" if it creates a substantial risk of harm; the risk of harm can be
assessed with reference to the tolerance of the community, under the
""community standard of tolerance"" test; and

 

(c)Explicit
sex that is neither violent nor degrading or dehumanizing, which will not
generally fall under s. 163(8) of the Code, according to Sopinka J.

 

                   I must say at the
outset that I differ only with respect to the third category of materials.  I
am not prepared to affirm as boldly as my colleague Sopinka J. does that
it escapes the application of s. 163(8) .

 

                   Materials of the
Third Category

 

                   The dual nature, as
representation and content, of the subject matter of s. 163  comes into play
here.  Yet the classification proposed by my colleague Sopinka J. focuses
only on content.  The content of the first two categories of materials is so
likely to harm that the characteristics of the representation do not really
matter: if there is violence or degradation or dehumanization, as long as the
element of representation is present, harm will probably ensue.

 

                   The content of the
third category of materials is generally perceived as unlikely to cause harm,
as Sopinka J. rightly points out.  He mentions as an exception child
pornography, i.e. materials in the production of which children were employed. 
This exception is important, since it obviously flows from the high likelihood
of harm ensuing from the production and dissemination of child pornography.

 

                   In addition to this
exception, it is quite conceivable that the representation may cause harm, even
if its content as such may not be seen as harmful.  It is helpful to quote here
a passage from R. v. Sudbury News Service Ltd. (1978), 18 O.R. (2d) 428,
at p. 435, where Howland C.J.O. wrote:

 

There
are some publications which are so blatantly indecent that they would not be
tolerable by the Canadian community under any circumstances.  Some pictures are
offensive to the majority of people to the point that the Canadian community
would not tolerate them on a billboard, or on the cover of a magazine, or on a
television screen where persons of all ages and sensibilities would be exposed
to them, but would be prepared to tolerate them being viewed by persons who wished
to view them.  Some pictures would not be acceptable by Canadian community
standards in a children's bedtime story-book or primer but would be in a
magazine for general distribution.

 

This passage and the surrounding
sentences were also quoted in the judgment of Dickson C.J. in Towne
Cinema, supra, for the proposition that the tolerance of the
Canadian community will vary according to the audience of the materials. 
Dickson C.J. was in minority on this issue; as was mentioned above, the
majority agreed with Wilson J. that the actual audience to which the
materials are presented is not relevant.  I accept the opinion of
Wilson J., as it was concurred in by the majority.

 

                   The above passage,
however, brings out another important aspect, the manner of representation. 
This was not at issue in Towne Cinema, supra, and neither
Dickson C.J. nor Wilson J. addressed this point in his/her respective
opinion.  The manner of representation, of public suggestion, can greatly
contribute to the deformation of sexuality, through the loss of its humanity. 
Even if the content is not as such objectionable (and, I would say, even more
so), the manner in which the material is presented may turn it from innocuous
to socially harmful.  After all, it is the element of representation that gives
this material its power of suggestion, and it seems quite conceivable that this
power may cause harm despite the apparent neutrality of the content.  A host of
factors could intervene in the manner of representation to affect the characterization
of the material, among which are the medium, the type or the use.

 

                   The medium provides
a good example.  Indeed the differences between the various media are not
acknowledged often enough in opinions dealing with s. 163 of the Code. 
This Court, in Hawkshaw v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 668, has decided
that the definition of obscenity in s. 163(8) of the Code applies
throughout the Code, whether the material is a publication or not, but
that does not preclude s. 163(8)  from taking into account the medium of
representation.  Statements are made regarding the law of obscenity where a
movie is impugned, for instance, and it is often taken for granted that they
will apply to all media.

 

                   Nevertheless it
seems natural to me that the likelihood of harm, and the tolerance of the
community, may vary according to the medium of representation, even if the
content stays the same.  Let me take, as an example, an explicit portrayal of
""plain"" sexual intercourse, where two individuals are making love. 
This falls within the third category of Sopinka J.  If found in words in a
book, it is unlikely to be of much concern (if found in a children's book,
though, this may be different).  If found depicted in a magazine or in a movie,
the likelihood of harm increases but remains low.  If found on a poster, it is
already more troublesome.  If found on a billboard sign, then I would venture
that it may well be an undue exploitation of sex, because the community does
not tolerate it, on the basis of its harmfulness.

 

                   The harmfulness, in
the billboard sign example, would come from the immediacy of the
representation, inasmuch as the sign stands all by itself (as opposed to a
passage in a book, a film or a magazine).  Its message is at once crude and
inescapable.  It distorts human sexuality by taking it out of any context
whatsoever and projecting it to the public.  This example goes to the extreme,
of course, but it is meant to show that the element of representation may
create a likelihood of harm that may lead to the application of s. 163 of the Code,
even if the content of the representation as such is not objectionable.

 

                   As I mentioned, the
medium of representation is but one variable pertaining to representation that
may trigger the application of s. 163  to third-category materials.  The overall
type or use of the representation, be it education, art, advertising, sexual
arousal or other, may also be relevant, among other factors.  These factors tie
in to the ""internal necessities"" test to some extent.  This test, if
it is to find a place within the interpretive framework of Sopinka J.,
must intervene at the representational level, to change the characterization
that would ensue from a mere look at the content of the materials.

 

                   For these reasons,
therefore, I would hold that materials falling within Sopinka J.'s third
category (explicit sex with neither violence nor degradation or
dehumanization), while generally less likely to cause harm than those of the
first two categories, may nevertheless come within the definition of obscene at
s. 163(8) of the Code, if their content (child pornography) or their
representational element (the manner of representation) is found conducive of
harm.

 

                   Tolerance and Harm

 

                   The assessment of
the risk of harm here depends on the tolerance of the community, as is the case
with the second category of materials.  This brings me to outline a certain
shift in the meaning of ""tolerance"".  In Towne Cinema, supra,
Dickson C.J. formulated the community standard test as follows at
p. 508:

 

. .
. it is a standard of tolerance, not taste, that is relevant.  What
matters is not what Canadians think is right for themselves to see.  What
matters is what Canadians would not abide other Canadians seeing because it
would be beyond the contemporary Canadian standard of tolerance to allow them
to see it.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

It is unclear from this excerpt what
the basis of tolerance is.  It seems that tolerance is for taste the conceptual
equivalent of the reasonable person to the actual plaintiff: an abstraction, an
average perhaps.  Tolerance would be some form of enlightened, altruistic
taste, which would factor in and sum up the tastes of the whole population.

 

                   In the mind of
Dickson C.J., there exists no necessary relationship between tolerance and
harm, as he mentions at p. 505:

 

                   However,
as I have noted above, there is no necessary coincidence between the
undueness of publications which degrade people by linking violence, cruelty or
other forms of dehumanizing treatment with sex, and the community standard of
tolerance.  Even if certain sex related materials were found to be within the
standard of tolerance of the community, it would still be necessary to ensure
that they were not ""undue"" in some other sense, for example in the sense
that they portray persons in a degrading manner as objects of violence,
cruelty, or other forms of dehumanizing treatment.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

                   Sopinka J.
uses the community standard of tolerance to gauge the risk of harm.  In this
context, tolerance must be related to the harm.  It must mean not only
tolerance of the materials, but also tolerance of the harm which they may bring
about.  It is a more complicated and more reflective form of tolerance than
what was considered by Dickson C.J. in Towne Cinema, supra. 
Such a development is fully in accordance with the emphasis put by this Court
on harm as the central element in the interpretation of s. 163(8) .  

 

                   In the context of
the third category, the harm sought to be avoided is the same as in the first
two categories, that is attitudinal changes.  While this type of harm was clear
in the case of the first category and was probable in the case of the second,
it is perhaps more remote here, and will likely occur only in a limited number
of cases.  The main difference between the second and third categories lies in
the presumed likelihood of harm: while degrading or dehumanizing materials are
likely to cause harm regardless of whether the community may be ready to
tolerate such harm, materials which show no violence, no degradation or
dehumanization are less likely to cause harm, and the evidence with respect to
the lack of tolerance of the community will be central.  Still the risk of harm
flowing from the content or the representational element of third-category
materials is not always so slight as my colleague Sopinka J. pictures it. 
If the community cannot tolerate this risk of harm, then in my opinion these
materials, even though they may offer a non-violent, non-degrading,
non-dehumanizing content, will constitute undue exploitation of sex and will
fall under the definition of obscenity at s. 163(8) of the Code.

 

The Constitutional Validity of s. 163
of the Code

 

                   With respect to the
constitutional aspects of this case, I am in agreement with Sopinka J., and
I wish only to complement his reasons on the objective of s. 163 of the Code.

 

                   In his reasons,
Sopinka J. rules out the possibility that ""public morality"" can
be a legitimate objective for s. 163 of the Code and, while admitting
that Parliament may legislate to protect ""fundamental conceptions of
morality"", he goes on to conclude that the true objective of s. 163  is the
avoidance of harm to society.

 

                   In my opinion, the
distinction between the two orders of morality advanced by my colleague is
correct, and the avoidance of harm to society is but one instance of a
fundamental conception of morality.

 

                   First of all, I
cannot conceive that the State could not legitimately act on the basis of
morality.  Since its earliest Charter  pronouncements, this Court has
acknowledged this possibility.  In R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1
S.C.R. 295, Dickson J. (as he then was) wrote for the Court at
p. 337:

 

Freedom
means that, subject to such limitations as are necessary to protect public
safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of
others, no one is to be forced to act in a way contrary to his beliefs or his
conscience.

 

Morality is also listed as one of the
grounds for which freedom of expression can be restricted in the European
Convention on Human Rights at article 10:

 

1.                Everyone
has the right to freedom of expression . . . .

 

2.                The
exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and
responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions
or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic
society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public
safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health
or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for
preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for
maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.

 

The European Court of Human Rights has
recognized the validity of prohibitions of obscene materials in English and
Swiss law, respectively, on the basis that they concern morals, in the Handyside
Case, judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A No. 24 and in the Case
of Müller and Others, judgment of 24 May 1988, Series A No. 133.

 

                   Indeed the problem
is not so much to assess whether morality is a valid objective under the Charter 
as to determine under which conditions it is a pressing and substantial
objective.  Not all moral claims will be sufficient to warrant an override of Charter 
rights.  As R. Dworkin wrote in the chapter of Taking Rights Seriously
(1977) entitled ""Liberty and Moralism"" at p. 255:

 

                   The
claim that a moral consensus exists is not itself based on a poll.  It is based
on an appeal to the legislator's sense of how his community reacts to some
disfavored practice.  But this same sense includes an awareness of the grounds
on which that reaction is generally supported.  If there has been a public
debate involving the editorial columns, speeches of his colleagues, the
testimony of interested groups, and his own correspondence, these will sharpen
his awareness of what arguments and positions are in the field.  He must sift these
arguments and positions, suppose general principles or theories vast parts of
the population could not be supposed to accept, and so on.

 

This task that Dworkin assigns to
Parliament is also entrusted to this Court in Charter  review.  Two
dimensions are important here, which allow one to distinguish between morality
in the general sense and ""fundamental conceptions of morality"".

 

                   First of all, the
moral claims must be grounded.  They must involve concrete problems such as
life, harm, well-being, to name a few, and not merely differences of opinion or
of taste.  Parliament cannot restrict Charter  rights simply on the basis
of dislike; this is what is meant by the expression ""substantial and
pressing"" concern.

 

                   Secondly, a
consensus must exist among the population on these claims.  They must attract
the support of more than a simple majority of people.  In a pluralistic society
like ours, many different conceptions of the good are held by various segments
of the population.  The guarantees of s. 2  of the Charter  protect this
pluralistic diversity.  However, if the holders of these different conceptions
agree that some conduct is not good, then the respect for pluralism that
underlies s. 2  of the Charter  becomes less insurmountable an objection
to State action (this argument has recently been rejuvenated and reformulated
in S. Gardbaum, ""Why the Liberal State Can Promote Moral Ideals After
All"" (1991), 104 Harv. L. Rev. 1350).  In this sense a wide
consensus among holders of different conceptions of the good is necessary
before the State can intervene in the name of morality.  This is also comprised
in the phrase ""pressing and substantial"".

 

                   The avoidance of
harm caused to society through attitudinal changes certainly qualifies as a
""fundamental conception of morality"".  After all, one of the chief
aspirations of morality is the avoidance of harm.  It is well grounded, since
the harm takes the form of violations of the principles of human equality and
dignity.  Obscene materials debase sexuality.  They lead to the humiliation of
women, and sometimes to violence against them.  This is more than just a matter
of taste.  Without entering into the examination of the rational connection,
some empirical evidence even elucidates the link between these materials and
actual violence.  Even then, as was said by this Court in Irwin Toy Ltd. v.
Quebec (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927, in R. v. Keegstra,
[1990] 3 S.C.R. 697, and as is reiterated by my colleague in his reasons,
scientific proof is not required, and reason and common experience will often
suffice.

 

                   Furthermore, taking
into account that people hold different conceptions about good taste and the
acceptable level of sexual explicitness, most would agree that these
attitudinal changes are serious and warrant State intervention (civil liberty
groups who advocated that this Court strike down s. 163 of the Code
concede that harm can justify State intervention, but they deny that any harm
flows from obscene materials; that is a different question).

 

                   I agree with
Sopinka J. that s. 163 of the Code aims at preventing harm to
society and I fully endorse his analysis, and as I tried to demonstrate I would
not hesitate to affirm that the prevention of harm is a moral objective that is
valid under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

                   I also agree with
Sopinka J.'s analysis of the proportionality between the restriction
effected by s. 163 of the Code and its objectives.  I would add a
remark, however, on the first factor listed by Sopinka J. under the
minimal impairment branch of the proportionality test, that is the exception
for materials of the third category.  Contrary to Sopinka J., I consider
that the third category may sometimes attract criminal liability.  The
requirement that the impugned materials exceed the community standard of
tolerance of harm provides sufficient precision and protection for those whose
activities are at stake.  This is so as, on the one hand, the field of sexual
exploitation is one of first apprehension, directly related to one of the
primary aspects of human personality, and well known to all, including
particularly those engaged in it.  On the other hand, the criterion of
tolerance of harm by the community as a whole is one that, by definition,
reflects the general level of tolerance throughout all sectors of the
community, hence generally of all its members.  It is therefore a very
demanding criterion to meet as it must be by definition generally known or
apprehended.  It is indeed not far removed from the domain of public notoriety
and, inasmuch as it falls within it, may be the subject of judicial notice not
requiring specific proof. 

 

                   Subject to the
foregoing comments, I otherwise concur both with the reasons and the
disposition of the case of my colleague Sopinka J.

on appeal from the nova scotia supreme
court, appeal division

 

            Criminal law ‑‑
Disorderly conduct ‑‑ Causing disturbance ‑‑ Accused
shouting obscenities at neighbour ‑‑ Meaning of ""disturbance""
‑‑ Whether accused caused a disturbance in public place ‑‑
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 175(1) (a)(i).

 

            The accused was charged
with causing a disturbance by using insulting or obscene language contrary to
s. 175(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code . On two occasions, he
went onto the veranda of his house and shouted obscenities at his neighbour
across the street. The neighbour filed a complaint and testified for the Crown.
No evidence was adduced indicating that anyone else heard the accused's statements
or that the neighbour's conduct was affected by them. The trial judge convicted
the accused on the ground that his conduct in itself constituted a disturbance
within s. 175(1) (a). He found as well that the neighbour was
""disturbed"" by the accused's conduct. The summary conviction appeal
court affirmed the convictions and the Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal
from that decision. The only issue before this Court is whether the evidence
establishes that the accused's use of insulting and obscene language caused a
""disturbance"" in or near a public place.

 

            Held: The appeal should be allowed. The
convictions should be quashed and acquittals entered in their place.

 

            The weight of the
authorities, the principles of statutory construction and policy
considerations, taken together, lead to the conclusion that the
""disturbance"" contemplated by s. 175(1) (a) is something
more than mere emotional upset or annoyance. Before an offence can arise under
that section, the enumerated conduct must cause an externally manifested
disturbance of the public peace, in the sense of an interference with the
ordinary and customary use by the public of the place in question. The
interference may be minor but it must be present. It may be proven by direct
evidence or be inferred from the evidence of a police officer as to the conduct
of a person or persons under s. 175(2). The disturbance may consist of the
impugned act itself or it may flow as a consequence of the impugned act.
Finally, in accordance with the principle of legality, the disturbance must be
one which may reasonably have been foreseen in the particular circumstances of
time and place.

 

            In the case at bar, there
was no evidence of a disturbance of the use of the premises in question by
anyone.  The trial judge applied a mental disturbance test, convicting on the
basis that an ""ordinary reasonable individual would be disturbed by
language of that nature being shouted in a public area"".  There was no
finding that the conduct of the neighbour or anyone else was affected or
disturbed by the language. In the absence of such findings, the convictions
cannot stand.

of the Criminal Code . Appeal allowed.

            The judgment of the Court
was delivered by 

 

            McLachlin
J. -- This case requires
this Court for the first time to consider what constitutes a public disturbance
under s. 175(1) (a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ,
which makes it an offence to cause a disturbance in or near a public place by, inter
alia, fighting, screaming, shouting, swearing, singing or using insulting
or obscene language.  Shouting or swearing or singing are not in themselves
criminal offences.  They become criminal only when they cause a disturbance in
or near a public place.  What constitutes such a disturbance?  For example,
does mere annoyance or emotional disturbance of the complainant suffice?  Or is
something more required?

 

The Facts

 

            The case began as a
disagreement between two neighbours in the town of Milton, Nova Scotia.  The
appellant, Donald Lohnes, lived across the street from a certain Mr. Porter. 
Mr. Porter, it seems, was given to collecting equipment on his premises and
running motors which made loud noises.  This disturbed Mr. Lohnes.  It
disturbed him so much that on two occasions a year apart he went onto the
veranda of his house and shouted obscenities at Mr. Porter.  The essence of Mr.
Lohnes' remarks was that he did not want Mr. Porter ""to run that chain saw
or that lawn mower or to leave that or have that God-damned junk heap"". 
This was embellished by a string of epithets revealing an impressive command of
the obscene vernacular.  On the second occasion Mr. Lohnes concluded his
oration with the assertion that he would shoot Mr. Porter if he had a gun.

 

            Mr. Porter filed a
complaint.  He was the only Crown witness.  There was no evidence that anyone
else heard Mr. Lohnes' statements or that Mr. Porter's conduct was affected by
them.

 

            Mr. Lohnes was convicted
on the ground that his conduct in itself constituted a disturbance within s.
175(1) (a) of the Criminal Code ; the trial judge found, as well,
that Mr. Porter was ""disturbed"" by the impugned conduct.  The
convictions were upheld by the summary conviction appeal court.  The Nova
Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division refused leave from that decision: (1990),
100 N.S.R. (2d) 268, 272 A.P.R. 268.  He now appeals to this Court.

 

Legislation

 

Section
175  of the Criminal Code , states:

 

            175. (1) Every one who

 

(a)  not
being in a dwelling‑house, causes a disturbance in or near a public
place,

 

(i)
by fighting, screaming, shouting, swearing, singing or using insulting or
obscene language,

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

is
guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction. 

 

            (2)
In the absence of other evidence, or by way of corroboration of other evidence,
a summary conviction court may infer from the evidence of a peace officer
relating to the conduct of a person or persons, whether ascertained or not,
that a disturbance described in paragraph (1)(a) or (d) was
caused or occurred.

 

Analysis

 

            Section 175(1) (a)
creates a two-element offence consisting of:  (1) commission of one of the
enumerated acts; which, (2) causes a disturbance in or near a public place. 
There is no doubt on the facts of this case that one of the enumerated acts was
committed.  The only question is whether the evidence establishes that it
caused a disturbance in or near a public place. 

 

            The word
""disturbance"" encompasses a broad range of meanings.  At one extreme,
it may be something as innocuous as a false note or a jarring colour; something
which disturbs in the sense of annoyance or disruption.  At the other end of
the spectrum are incidents of violence, inducing disquiet, fear and
apprehension for physical safety. Between these extremes lies a vast variety of
disruptive conduct.  The question before us is whether all conduct within this
broad spectrum elicits criminal liability under s. 175(1) , and if not, where
the line should be drawn.

 

            The Nova Scotia Supreme
Court, Appeal Division in dismissing Mr. Lohnes' application for leave to
appeal, agreed with the finding implicit to the judgments below: all that is
required to establish an offence under s. 175(1) (a) is one of the forms
of prohibited conduct (fighting, screaming, shouting, swearing, singing or
using insulting or obscene language) which one ought to know would disturb
others.  The appellant contends that this interpretation is too broad; there
must be some overtly manifested disturbance of the public's use and enjoyment
of the public place where the act takes place.  The main issue thus turns on
how ""disturbance"" in s. 175(1) (a) is defined; does foreseeable
emotional upset suffice, or must there be an externally manifested disturbance
of a public nature?  The appeal, like the judgments below, focuses upon the
requisite actus reus of the offence, although the issue of mens rea,
as recognized by the respondent, flows necessarily from a discussion of
`disturbance'.  A subsidiary issue concerns whether the act itself may
constitute the disturbance, or whether a secondary disturbance is required.

 

            The values at stake on
this appeal are readily discerned.  On the one hand lies the freedom of the
individual to shout, sing or otherwise express himself or herself.  On the
other lies the collective right of every subject to peace and tranquillity. 
Neither right is absolute.  The individual right of expression must at some
point give way to the collective interest in peace and tranquillity, and the
collective right in peace and tranquillity must be based on recognition that in
a society where people live together some degree of disruption must be
tolerated.  The question is where the line is to be drawn.

 

            I propose to consider
these issues from the perspectives of the authorities, the principles of
statutory construction, and the underlying policy issues.  On my reading, these
considerations point to the conclusion that s. 175(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code  requires an externally manifested disturbance in or near a public
place, consisting either in the act itself or in a secondary disturbance.

 

The Authorities

 

            The offence created by s.
175(1) (a) finds its origins in the common law of vagrancy, an `offence
against public convenience', which proscribed certain behaviour in order to
preserve peace and order in the community:  see, for example, An Act
respecting Vagrants, S.C. 1869, c. 28.  In 1947, the Criminal Code 
created a new and distinct offence of causing a disturbance; the offence was
moved from the section of the Code entitled ""Vagrancy"" to the
nuisance offences falling under Part V labelled ""Offences Against
Religion, Morals and Public Convenience"":  S.C. 1947, c. 55, s. 3.   Upon
the Code's revision in 1955, S.C. 1953-54, c. 51, the offence was
included in Part IV, renamed ""Sexual Offences, Public Morals and
Disorderly Conduct"", as s. 160 under the section entitled ""Disorderly
Conduct"".

 

            Our jurisprudence has
exhibited two different doctrinal approaches to the offence dating to the first
federal vagrancy enactments.  The first line of authority adopts an expansive
approach to ""disturbance""; the second a narrower approach which would
limit ""disturbance"" by requiring external manifestations of
disturbance.  The different approaches are exemplified in the judgments of the
New Brunswick Court of Appeal in R. v. C.D. (1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 206
on the one hand; and the judgment of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in R.
v. Swinimer (1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 432, on the other.

 

            Swinimer adopted the expansive approach;
""the disturbance is to be found in the doing of any of the specified acts
in or near a public place if such disturbs or could reasonably be inferred as
disturbing another person or persons"": at p. 439, per
Macdonald J.A.  The court in  R. v. C.D., by contrast, saw the offence
as involving two elements:  the offensive act and a separate resulting disturbance. 
As Limerick J.A. put it (at p. 213):  ""`Fighting, screaming
. . . using insulting language. . .' mentioned in cl. (a)(i)
are not synonymous with creating a disturbance but are the causes of the
subsequent disturbance which is the offence"".  ""[T]he mere disturbing
of the peace or tranquility of one person's mind"" was held insufficient to
give rise to the offence (p. 214).

 

            The British Columbia Court
of Appeal charted a path between these two approaches in R. v. Peters
(1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 83.  A secondary disturbance was not always required;
the act of shouting or swearing or singing itself could constitute the
disturbance.  At the same time, shouting obscenities in a loud voice at two
police officers was held, in this particular case, not to amount to a
disturbance `in and of itself'.  Therefore, one or more persons must be
""affected"" by the conduct for there to be a disturbance within the
section (p. 91).  Taggart J.A. for the court quoted with approval the reasoning
Verchere J. had earlier used (R. v. Wolgram (1975), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 536
(B.C.S.C.), at p. 537) for dismissing such a charge:

 

It
was not made to appear that any person or persons were so disturbed by what
occurred as to cause some disorder or agitation to ensue or that there was
any interference with the ordinary and customary use by the public of a public
place; and although the peace and tranquillity of the minds of the police
officers and of some, at least, of the onlookers might well have been
interrupted, it has been said by high authority that there must be something
more.  [Emphasis added.]

 

            A review of the
authorities would not be complete without mention of the reasons of MacKeigan
C.J.N.S. in Swinimer, concurring in the result but taking a different
approach to construction of the section.  His reasons are important for two
assertions.  The first is that the Criminal Code  speaks of disturbance
of a public place, not of someone's mind (at pp. 434-35):

 

            It
seems to me that a ""disturbance"" is an objective term relating to the
noise and confusion created by the specified means of fighting, screaming,
swearing, etc.  The primary definition of ""disturbance"" in the Oxford
Universal Dictionary is -- ""The interruption of tranquillity, peace, rest
or settled condition"".  This objective sense is clearly meant in s.
171(1)(d) [now s. 175(1) (d)] which makes it an offence to
""disturb the peace and quiet of occupants of a dwelling house by
discharging firearms or by other disorderly conduct in a public place"". 
Section 171(2) [now s. 175(2)] refers to whether ""a disturbance described
in paragraph (1)(a) or (d) was caused or occurred""; the use
of the words ""disturbance"" and ""occurred"" seems to me to
confirm further that objective standards are to be employed.

 

            Thus,
if the Queen's peace has been disturbed, it should not be necessary to prove
that any particular onlooker was emotionally upset or might reasonably have
been so upset.  It should be enough to show beyond a reasonable doubt, from the
nature and degree of the fighting, shouting, etc., that the ""peace and
quiet"" of the area had been disturbed.  It thus would not be a defence,
which it would be if a subjective test is used, for the accused to get all
persons who heard or saw the episode to testify that they were not
""disturbed"".  Indeed, one can imagine a case such as this where all
the spectators were hard-boiled individuals, who far from being emotionally
""disturbed"" enjoyed and applauded the disturbers and their abuse of
the police.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

The second is the assertion that
""[w]hether a disturbance has occurred is a question of fact and depends on
the degree and intensity of the activity complained of, and on the degree and
nature of the `peace' which should be expected to prevail in the particular
public place at the particular time"" (p. 435).  The latter comment
suggests that formulae based on descriptions of conduct without more may be
inadequate; the context in which the activity takes place must be considered so
that the countervailing interests can be duly weighed.  The lawful jangling of
the street musician at an urban intersection at noon may become criminal if
conducted outside a citizen's bedroom window at three o'clock in the morning.

 

            One more case must be
considered.  It is the decision of this Court in Skoke-Graham v. The Queen,
[1985] 1 S.C.R. 106.  While the charges were under a different section,
disrupting the solemnity of a religious gathering, the judgments of Dickson J.
(as he then was) and Wilson J., concurring in result, offer insights into the
proper balance between the competing interests in public order and personal
liberty and their reconciliation with the practical exigencies of prosecution
and defence.  The section made it an offence to ""wilfully disturb"" a
religious gathering.  Both Dickson and Wilson JJ. rejected the contention that
unmanifested annoyance or upset could constitute a disturbance, Wilson J.
commenting that on the Swinimer test, ""anyone in any given
situation would act at the risk of causing some unmanifested  emotional upset
or `disturbance' to another person"" (p. 131).  In this, as well as in the
acceptance that the disturbance may arise either from the act itself or from
its secondary effect (per Dickson J. for the majority), the
pronouncements resemble those made in R. v. Peters, supra.  As
Dickson J. put it at p. 118:

 

            In
my opinion, it is not sufficient to found a conviction under s. 172(3) that an
accused's conduct produce annoyance, anxiety, or emotional upset in the members
of the assemblage met for religious worship.  Where the impugned acts are
brief, essentially passive and peaceful in nature and are voluntarily desisted
from, upon request, as they were in this case, then there is no crime.  There
must be some activity in the nature of a disorder which occurs as a result of
this conduct before a trial judge would be entitled to find the order of
solemnity of a meeting had been disturbed.  Where, on the other hand, the
impugned actions are not passive nor peaceful in nature, they may in themselves
constitute activity in the nature of a disorder sufficient to found a
conviction under this subsection.

 

            Whatever their theoretical
pronouncements, Canadian courts have entered few if any convictions under (what
is now) s. 175(1) (a) absent an overtly manifested disturbance which
affected people's conduct, be it found in the act itself or in its effect.  In Swinimer
the accused's fighting, shouting and obscene language in front of his residence
interfered with the usual activities of a neighbour as well as her children, to
judge from her testimony that she had to return to the bedroom during the
episode to calm the children down.  The conviction in R. v. Allick
(cited in R. v. Peters, supra, at p. 90) arose from a spirited
barroom brawl.  In R. v. Chikoski (1973), 14 C.C.C. (2d) 38 (Ont. Prov.
Ct.), the police officer testified that the obscenities which the accused had
shouted at him not only offended and disturbed him but caused a group of men
working in a field some 200 feet away to stop their work and look up towards
the place where the police officer and the accused were standing.  In R. v.
C.D., the trial judge found that the accused caused an affray in the street
by shouting and ramming his car into the back of another car, reducing the wife
of the owner to tears.  Yet, the Court of Appeal overturned even this
conviction, finding that the interruption of `tranquility' of mind or the
`emotional upset' caused the owner and his wife was insufficient to constitute
a `disturbance'.  Shouting abusive language without more was held not to
trigger the section in R. v. Eyre (1972), 10 C.C.C. (2d) 236 (B.C.S.C.)
and R. v. Peters.  In R. v. Wolgram, supra, shouting
obscenities at police in a barroom was similarly held not to offend the section
because ""[i]t was not made to appear that any person or persons were so
disturbed by what occurred as to cause some disorder or agitation to ensue or
that there was any interference with the ordinary and customary use by the
public of a public place"" (p. 537).

 

            I conclude that the weight
of the authority, whether viewed from the point of view of theory or result,
suggests that before an offence can arise under s. 175(1)  of the Criminal
Code , the enumerated conduct must cause an overtly manifested disturbance
which constitutes an interference with the ordinary and customary use by the
public of the place in question.  This may be proved by direct evidence or
inferred under s. 175(2) .  It is not necessary that there be a separate
disturbance secondary to the disturbing act; the act itself may in some cases
amount to a disturbance and ""cause"" it in this sense.  Finally, the
principle of legality, alluded to in the judgment of Wilson J. in Skoke‑Graham
suggests that only conduct which may reasonably be expected to cause such a
disturbance in the particular circumstances of the case falls within
s. 175(1) (a) (see p. 000, below).

 

Principles of Statutory Construction

 

            The word 
""disturbance""  is capable of many meanings.  The task is to choose
the meaning which best accords with the intention of Parliament.

 

            The following arguments
support the conclusion that ""disturbance"" in s. 175(1) (a)
involves more than mere mental or emotional annoyance or disruption.

 

            First, the noun
""disturbance"" may have a different connotation than the verb ""to
disturb"".  Not everything that disturbs people results in a disturbance
(e.g., smoking). A definition which posits identity between ""disturb""
and ""disturbance"" is contrary to ordinary usage, the most fundamental
principle of statutory construction.  This is not to say that one cannot speak
of a purely emotional disturbance, but rather that ""disturbance"" has
a secondary meaning which ""disturb"" does not possess; a meaning which
suggests interference with an ordinary and customary conduct or use.

 

            Second, the context of
""disturbance"" in s. 175(1) (a) suggests that Parliament did not
intend to protect society from mere emotional disturbance.  Had Parliament
sought to protect society from annoyance and anxiety, the section would not be
confined to acts occurring in or near a public place, nor would it single out
particular forms of objectionable conduct -- many other types of conduct
disturb us.  Parliament could have expressly protected against emotional
disturbance, as was done in the Public Order Act 1986 (U.K.), 1986, c.
64.  But, to borrow the language of MacKeigan C.J.N.S. in Swinimer, supra,
Parliament chose to speak of a disturbance in or near a public place, not in
someone's mind.  By addressing ""disturbance"" in the public context,
Parliament signalled that its objective was not the protection of individuals
from emotional upset, but the protection of the public from disorder calculated
to interfere with the public's normal activities.

 

            Third, interpretative aids
suggest that s. 175(1) (a) is directed at publicly exhibited disorder. 
As noted in Skoke-Graham, supra, headings and preambles may be
used as intrinsic aids in interpreting ambiguous statutes.  Section 175(1) (a)
appears under the section ""Disorderly Conduct"".  Without elevating
headings to determinative status, the heading under which s. 175(1) (a)
appears supports the view that Parliament had in mind, not the emotional upset
or annoyance of individuals, but disorder and agitation which interfere with
the ordinary use of a place.

 

            Fourth, the word used for
disturbance in the french version of s. 175(1) , ""tapage"",
connotes an externally manifested disturbance involving violent noise or
confusion disrupting the tranquillity of those using the area in question.  For
example, Le Petit Robert 1 (1990)  defines the term as:  ""1o
Bruit violent, confus, désordonné produit par un groupe de personnes
. . . Tapage injurieux ou nocturne:  consistant à troubler la
tranquillité des habitants en faisant du bruit, sans motif légitime"". 
(Emphasis in original.)  

 

            Finally, it can be argued
that the reference in s. 175(2) to an inference of disturbance from evidence
""relating to the conduct of a person or persons"" is
consistent with the finding that Parliament had in mind the effect of the
shouting, swearing or singing, for example, on the conduct of persons
other than the accused.  In short, Parliament was concerned with how members of
the public other than the accused may have been affected by the impugned act.

 

Policy

 

            Considerations pertaining
to the practical application of the criminal law suggest that the narrower
""public disturbance"" interpretation of s. 175(1) (a) is
preferable to the broader ""emotional disturbance"" standard.

 

            The first consideration
pertains to fundamental justice, and in particular the principle of legality,
which affirms the entitlement of every person to know in advance whether their
conduct is illegal.  As Wilson J. points out in Skoke-Graham, supra,
application of the internal test would mean that ""anyone in any given
situation would act at the risk of causing some unmanifested emotional upset or
`disturbance' to another person"" (p. 131).  Read thus, s. 175(1) (a)
imposes a duty to ascertain whether one's conduct disturbs or can reasonably be
expected to disturb the ""mental"" or ""emotional""
tranquillity of others. Such a burden, dependant as it is on time, place,
circumstance and the sensitivities of others, verges on the capricious.  It may
well be questioned whether it could ever be discharged with certainty.

 

            The second consideration
is that the narrower ""public disturbance"" test permits a more
sensitive balancing between the countervailing interests at stake.  As
MacKeigan C.J.N.S. points out in Swinimer, the test for a disturbance in
or near a public place under s. 175(1) (a) should permit the court to
weigh the degree and intensity of the conduct complained of against the degree
and nature of the peace which can be expected to prevail in a given place at a
given time.  A test which accepts mental or emotional disturbance as sufficient
to establish the offence does not permit such balancing; all that is required
is that the accused should have known that someone might be internally
disturbed.  A test, on the other hand, which turns on whether the effect of the
conduct was such as to interfere with the ordinary and customary use of the
premises at the time and place in question, permits the countervailing factors
to be weighed and balanced.  As such, it arguably strikes a more sensitive
balance between the individual interest in liberty and the public interest in
going about its affairs in peace and tranquillity.

 

            The final policy
consideration takes us into the more precarious terrain of pondering the proper
goals and limits of the criminal law.  The Swinimer standard, adopted by
the courts below, would make it a criminal offence to sing or shout in
circumstances where a person has reason to believe that his or her conduct
might annoy or upset someone else, even though no one may have heard the sound,
much less have been affected by it.  In support of this interpretation, it was
argued that such a stringent standard is necessary in order to nip disturbances
in the bud before they become truly disruptive to the public. But it is far
from self-evident that the goal of peace and order in our public places
requires the criminal law to step in at the stage of foreseeability of mental
annoyance.  Indeed, our society has traditionally tolerated a great deal of activity
in our streets and byways which can and does disturb and annoy others sharing
the public space.  Given the intrusion on public liberty and the uncertainty in
the criminal law which such a rule would introduce, it is arguable that some
external manifestation of disorder in the sense of interference with the normal
use of the affected place should be required to transform lawful conduct into
an unlawful criminal offence.

 

Conclusion on the Ambit of Section
175(1) (a)

 

            The weight of the
authorities, the principles of statutory construction and policy
considerations, taken together, lead me to the conclusion that the disturbance
contemplated by s. 175(1) (a) is something more than mere emotional
upset.  There must be an externally manifested disturbance of the public peace,
in the sense of interference with the ordinary and customary use of the
premises by the public.  There may be direct evidence of such an effect or
interference, or it may be inferred from the evidence of a police officer as to
the conduct of a person or persons under s. 175(2).  The disturbance may
consist of the impugned act itself, as in the case of a fight interfering with
the peaceful use of a barroom, or it may flow as a consequence of the impugned
act, as where shouting and swearing produce a scuffle.  As the cases
illustrate, the interference with the ordinary and customary conduct in or near
the public place may consist in something as small as being distracted from
one's work.   But it must be present and it must be externally manifested.  In
accordance with the principle of legality, the disturbance must be one which
may reasonably have been foreseen in the particular circumstances of time and
place.

 

Disposition of the Appeal

 

            There was no evidence of a
disturbance of the use of the premises in question by anyone in the case at
bar.  The trial judge applied a mental disturbance test, convicting on the
basis that an ""ordinary reasonable individual would be disturbed by
language of that nature being shouted in a public area"".  The convictions
were upheld.  In denying leave to appeal, the Court of Appeal agreed that
language such as that used by the accused was ""inherently disturbing and
was of itself a disturbance"" (p. 270).  There was no finding that the
conduct of the complainant or anyone else was affected or disturbed by the
language.   In the absence of such findings, the convictions cannot stand.

 

            I would allow the appeal,
quash the convictions, and substitute acquittals in their place.

                   The police arrested
appellant for sexual assault and informed him of his rights to counsel and to
silence.  The appellant's father had been unable to retain a lawyer when
appellant was taken into custody and was to call when he had retained one.  The
lawyer, who was retained shortly afterwards,  telephoned the police.  The
police told him of the circumstances of the investigation and that the
appellant would probably be released later that day; he in turn told the police
officer not to take any statement from the appellant until he was present. 
Appellant testified that he asked the officer whether his father had called,
that he was told that he had not and that he could contact his father later. 
The officer did not inform the appellant that his father had retained a lawyer
or that the lawyer had telephoned.  The police officers initiated an
interrogation of the appellant.  The admissibility of evidence--first, that
allegedly given in the police car and, second, that given later during the
interrogation conducted after a lawyer had been retained--was disputed.  Only
the former was admitted at trial.

 

                   Appellant was tried
before a judge and jury.  Following arraignment, but before the first
prospective juror was asked to step forward, the court ruled, on a motion by
appellant's counsel, that both the Crown and the defence each be limited to
four peremptory challenges and that the Crown be denied the power to stand
jurors by.  The court noted the Crown's objection.  The jurors were then
selected with both the defence and the Crown exercising their four peremptory
challenges.

 

                   The jury acquitted
the appellant.  The Court of Appeal, however, allowed the Crown's appeal and
ordered a new trial.  The appellant appealed as of right and two constitutional
questions were stated:  whether ss. 562  and 563  of the Criminal Code 
were inconsistent with s. 11 (d) or s. 15  of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms  and, if so, whether ss. 562  and/or 563 were
justified by s. 1 .  Also at issue was whether the trial judge erred in
excluding the statements made after the lawyer had been retained.

 

                   Held (Gonthier, McLachlin and Iacobucci
JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed.  Sections 563(1)  and (2) 
of the Criminal Code  were inconsistent with s. 11 (d) of the Charter ;
this violation was not justified under s. 1 .

 

                   Per Lamer C.J., La Forest and Cory JJ.: 
The implementation of the impugned provisions would lead a reasonable person,
fully apprised* of the Crown's extensive rights in selecting a
jury, to conclude that there was an apprehension of bias contrary to
s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  This infringement was not
justified under s. 1 .  The ideal of absolute equality is not required by
the Charter .  However a discrepancy of 4.25 to 1 in favour of the Crown,
when the Crown's ability to stand by is compared to the accused's right to
peremptorily challenge, is so unbalanced that it gives an appearance of
unfairness or bias against the accused.  These provisions permit the Crown to
obtain a jury that would at the very least appear to be favourable to its
position rather than an unbiased jury.  A criminal trial must be fairly
conducted.  It cannot be forgotten that it is the jury that must make the ultimate
decision as to the guilt or innocence of the accused.

 

                   Per Stevenson J.:  Section 11 (d)
of the Charter  requires that an accused person receive a fair trial by
an independent and impartial tribunal.  The test for both judicial independence
and impartiality is whether the tribunal may be reasonably perceived as such. 
A jury need not be found to be actually partial before an infringement of the Charter 
is found.  The informed observer's perception that the system of selecting
jurors impairs impartiality is sufficient.  If one party enjoys a greater
influence, the observer need only have a reasonable apprehension of partiality.

 

                   The disparity
between the accused's and the Crown's right to challenge jurors cannot meet the
test.  The stand by cannot be upheld because it allows the Crown to have a
greater role in fashioning the jury.  The Crown may take partisan interests
into consideration in carrying out that role.  The accused's role is thereby
significantly diminished, impairing the appearance that the jury is indifferent
as between the Crown and the accused.  The substantial disparity contained in
this legislation exists not in a mere procedure or rule but in the role each
party has in choosing the jury.

 

                   The peremptory
challenge is ""purely subjective""  and a stand by, which can be
exercised until the whole panel has been called, is its equivalent.  The Crown,
in exercising its stand by power, can achieve a peremptory challenge,
effectively deferring a challenge for cause or peremptory challenge.  The stand
by is not a ""deferred challenge for cause"" because, with large jury
panels, a juror who is stood by will not be recalled in many cases.

 

                   The observer of the
process is bound to conclude that, absent some control, the Crown possesses a
substantial advantage and can effectively influence the make‑up of that
jury under partisan considerations.  Professed good intentions cannot be relied
on such a disparity.  The Crown is not uninterested in securing convictions of
accused persons.  Section 563  provides for the apparent transformation of
this interest into reality and so offends s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

                   The relative roles
of the accused and the Crown in selecting the jury are not comparable to other
procedures within the trial process.  The jury must be, and must be seen to be,
impartial.  When the Crown enjoys a tactical advantage, as occurs because of
the stand bys, the accused's role in selecting his or her jury is diminished.

 

                   The peremptory
challenge is not, itself, under attack.  It may be used under partisan
considerations, and, so long as the right of exercise is proportionate, neither
the Crown nor the accused can be said to have an unconstitutional advantage.

 

                   The Crown did not
establish that this Charter  breach was demonstrably justified in a free
and democratic society.  No pressing concern justifying a limitation was
demonstrated.

 

                   The trial judge
correctly excluded the statements.  The police, given compliance with the
s. 10 (b) requirement of advising the accused without delay of his
right to counsel, have no correlative duties triggered and cast upon them until
the accused, if he so chooses, has indicated his desire to exercise his right
to counsel.  An accused, once informed of the right to counsel, has the onus of
showing the opportunity to contact counsel was denied.  Here, the police had a
responsibility of doing more than literally answering the appellant's question
whether his father had called.  A literal response was misleading because the
obvious intent of the inquiry was to further the objective of communicating
with counsel.

 

                   Per Gonthier, McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ.
(dissenting):  As regards independence and impartiality of the tribunal in
criminal cases, ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter  are
congruent.  Section 11 (d) of the Charter  merely enunciates a
particular aspect of the general protection against deprivations of the right
to life, liberty and security of the person found in s. 7  of the Charter . 
Arguments made under s. 11 (d) of the Charter  apply with
equal force to s. 7 .

 

                   These reasons do
not depend on whether Crown peremptory challenges and stand bys are
distinguishable or not in practice, and hence it was assumed that they were
not.

 

                   The apprehension of
bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right‑minded
persons applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required
information; the grounds for that apprehension must be substantial.  An
allegation of institutional partiality is serious and generally implies that
the legal framework surrounding the institution in question is itself flawed,
irrespective of the particular circumstances of the various cases.

 

                   In the case at bar,
it was not sufficient, for a determination under s. 11 (d) of the Charter ,
simply to take notice of the disparity between the Crown and the accused in the
jury selection process and then to conclude that a reasonable apprehension of
bias arose.  The right‑minded observer must consider the question and
seek information in order to make an informed opinion.

 

 

                   A jury must be
representative, impartial and competent.  Random selection, which favours
representativeness, provides a certain guarantee that the jury will also be
impartial, but this is by no means true in all cases.  The Criminal Code 
offers to the parties various means of challenging prospective jurors, whether
collectively or individually, in order to bolster the impartiality of the
jury.  A proper jury, by implication, must also be competent.  Jurors should
also be able to understand the trial, their role in the trial, the evidence
that is presented, the principles they have to apply, among other things.  Most
trials require the same competence as is involved in the daily pursuit of one's
affairs, and the ability to speak and understand one of the official languages
will suffice.  Some trials are more complex and complicated, however, and a
tampering with randomness may be appropriate to achieve a minimal ability to
understand the evidence and issues.

 

                   The accused has a
fairly clear and circumscribed role in the trial and in the jury selection
process.  He or she is expected to do nothing more than try to avoid conviction
and punishment by asserting his or her rights according to law.  The accused,
however, has no right to a jury of his or her choice.

 

                   The role of the
Crown in the jury selection process, as in the trial as a whole, is not only
different, but also asymmetrical.  The Crown Attorney has a quasi‑judicial
role and must ensure that the jury is representative, impartial and competent. 
These qualities, especially impartiality, must not be sought to secure a
conviction but rather to select the best jury to try the case.  Indeed the
Crown Attorney should use the means at his or her disposal to exclude
prospective jurors that could be biased in favour of the prosecution, even if
the defence is not aware of this fact.  Through this role, in conformity with
its general duties, the Crown addresses the need to be able to exclude
prospective jurors who would not fall under any of the statutory grounds of
exclusion but whose presence on the jury would nevertheless impair its
impartiality, its representativeness or its competence.  It provides the
element of flexibility.

 

                   The relatively
large number of challenges and stand bys given to the Crown is consistent with
the need for flexibility in the process.  It is not incumbent upon the Court to
inquire into the adequacy of the actual numbers contained in the Code. 
They are the result of historical compromises and whether they are still
adequate today are questions better left for Parliament to decide.

 

                   The possibility of
a large number of Crown interventions in jury selection enables the Crown fully
to play its role when the situation so requires.  The Crown will not exercise
all of its four challenges and 48 stand bys merely because it holds them.  In
fact, a proper exercise of its role would call for restraint.  Since the Crown
plays this important quasi‑judicial role and infuses some flexibility
into the jury selection process, it is only normal that the means of exclusion
at its disposal also allow some room for manoeuvre.  Moreover, the limit of 48
itself is flexible, since upon judicial authorization it can be increased.  The
well-informed observer would see this disparity as a reflection of the
asymmetry between the roles of the accused and of the Crown attorney.

 

                   The observer would
not see any clear link between the jury selection process and the impartiality
of the empanelled jury.  Given the dearth of information made available, it is
not apparent that parties can influence the verdict by challenging or standing
by prospective jurors.  Indeed, any attempt to influence the verdict of the
jury by hand‑picking its members, unless it can be done on such a grand
scale as to affect the whole jury, is bound to run against the unanimity
requirement, and its efficacy may therefore be highly doubted by the observer. 
To argue that a mere disparity in the jury selection process suffices to
predetermine the verdict and to render the whole trial unfair denies the very
essence of the trial.  The criminal trial as a whole is an adversarial process,
designed to lay before the jury all the evidence and all the arguments that are
relevant to its decision.  If the verdict could be determined at the jury
selection stage, the trial would serve little purpose.

 

                   The well‑informed
observer, knowing the qualities expected in a good jury (impartiality,
representativeness and competence), understands the difference between the
roles of the accused and the Crown in the jury selection process as well as the
tenuous relationship of peremptory challenges and stand‑asides with the
impartiality of the jury and the fairness of the trial as a whole.  Considering
these factors, a disparity in the means afforded to the parties does not create
in this observer an apprehension that the jury is systematically partial
because of the operation of the provisions of the Criminal Code .

 

                   No evidence was
given as to abusive Crown practice.  Should Crown abuse occur, it can be
adequately dealt with on an individual basis.  The court must be mindful that
the Charter 's purpose is the unremitting protection of individual
rights.  The trial judge must ensure that the prosecution is not abusing its
power of stand bys and allay any apprehension as to partiality.

 

                   Section 686(1)(b)(iv)
(formerly s. 613(1)(b)(iii)) only applies to irregularities in procedure
which are so serious in nature that they are deemed to be matters of substance
which result in a loss of jurisdiction:  annulments for jurisdictional grounds
are limited to cases where prejudice to the accused has occurred, provided the
court had jurisdiction over the class of offences in question.  Here, the
problem was not one of application of the jury selection rules which could have
been saved by s. 686(1)(b)(iv).  The jury, together with the trial
judge, is the court and if the jury is not properly constituted
according to the rules, the court exists no more than if the judge had been
unlawfully appointed.  The rules were changed and the jury selected pursuant to
other rules than those set out in the Code.  There was therefore no
trial court properly constituted, and the appropriate sanction was annulment.

 

                   The trial judge was
in a better position to rule on the admissibility of the statements than the
Court of Appeal.  That court should not have interfered with his
determination.  The issue of the admissibility of the statement which had been
admitted was moot.

//Cory J.//

 

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and La Forest and Cory JJ. was delivered by

 

                   Cory
J. -- I have had the
privilege of reading the reasons of my colleagues Justice Stevenson and
Justice Gonthier.  Although I agree with the conclusion of Stevenson J., I
reach the result in a somewhat different manner.  In my view the implementation
of the impugned provisions would lead a reasonable person, fully apprised** of the
extensive rights the Crown may exercise in the selection of a jury, to conclude
that there was an apprehension of bias.

 

                   At the outset, I
would agree that the Crown Attorney plays a very responsible and respected role
in the criminal justice system and particularly in the conduct of criminal
trials.  It is true that the Crown never wins or loses a case.  Yet Crown
Attorneys are mortal.  They are subject to all the emotional and psychological
pressures that are exerted by individuals and the community.  They may act for
the best of motives.  For example they may be moved by sympathy for a helpless
victim, or by contempt for the cruel and perverted acts of an accused; they may
be influenced by the righteous sense of outrage of a community at the commission
of a particularly cruel and vicious crime.  As a rule the conduct and
competence of Crown Attorneys is exemplary.  They are models for the bar and
the community.  Yet they, like all of us, are subject to human frailties and
occasional lapses.

 

                   Crown attorneys
have been known to make inflammatory addresses to juries.  See R. v. Grover,
[1991] 3 S.C.R. 387, adopting the dissenting reasons in (1990), 56
C.C.C. (3d) 532 (Ont. C.A.).  They have been known to conduct unfair
cross- examinations of parties and witnesses.  See R. v. Logiacco
(1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 374 (Ont. C.A.).  I do not make these
observations in order to be critical of Crown Attorneys.  Rather they are made
to emphasize the very human frailties that are common to all, no matter what
the office held.

 

                   Apart from
challenges for cause the provisions of the Criminal Code  provide the
Crown with the ability to stand by 48 prospective jurors and to challenge four
jurors peremptorily.  The accused in this case has but 12 peremptory
challenges.  I do not suggest that the ideal of absolute equality is required
by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  However a discrepancy
of 4.25 to 1 in favour of the Crown seems to be so unbalanced that it gives an
appearance of unfairness or bias against the accused.  The impugned provisions
permit the Crown to obtain a jury that would at the very least appear to be
favourable to its position rather than an unbiased jury.

 

                   It is suggested
that the Crown Attorney, as an officer of the Court would never act unfairly in
the selection of a jury.  Yet the most exemplary Crown might be so overwhelmed
by community pressure that just such a step might be taken.  In R. v.
Pizzacalla (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 783, Morden A.C.J.O, Lacourcière and Catzman
JJ.A., it was conceded that as a result of the use made by the Crown Attorney
of the stand by provisions in the selection of a jury an apprehension of bias
was created.  I have cited this case not to illustrate or emphasize a legal
principle but rather for what it demonstrates.  Namely, that those acting for
the Crown do, on occasion demonstrate human frailties and that the impugned
section is, on occasion, utilized for the improper purpose of obtaining a jury
that appears to be favourable to the Crown.

 

                   A petition is
frequently made that we not be lead into temptation.  The impugned provision of
the Criminal Code  provides the tempting means to obtain a jury that
appears to be favourable to the Crown.  The section is so heavily weighed in
favour of the Crown that viewed objectively it must give that legal fictional
paragon, the reasonable person, fully apprised of the manner in which a jury
may be selected, an apprehension of bias.  This must be so since the jury, as a
result of the selection process, would appear to be favourable to the Crown. 
It seems to me that so long as this provision exists it may be used and on
occasion will be used to select a jury that appears to be favourable to the
Crown.

 

                   It may well be
correct that it would be impossible to prove that a jury selected after the
Crown had exercised all its stand bys and peremptory challenges was in fact
biased.  Nonetheless the overwhelming numerical superiority of choice granted
to the Crown creates a pervasive air of unfairness in the jury selection
procedure.  The jury in the ultimate decision maker.  The fate of the accused
is in its hands.  The jury should not as a result of the manner of its
selection appear to favour the Crown over the accused.  Fairness should be the
guiding principle of justice and the hallmark of criminal trials.  Yet so long
as the impugned provision of the Code remains, providing the Crown with
the ability to select a jury that appears to be favourable to it, the whole
trial process will be tainted with the appearance of obvious and overwhelming
unfairness.  Members of the community will be left in doubt as to the merits of
a process which permits the Crown to have more than four times as many choices
as the accused in the selection of the jury. 

 

                   Unfortunately it
would seem that whenever the Crown is granted statutory power that can be used
abusively then, on occasion, it will indeed be used abusively.  The protection
of basic rights should not be dependent upon a reliance on the continuous
exemplary conduct of the Crown, something that is impossible to monitor or
control.  Rather the offending statutory provision should be removed.

 

                   It follows that s.
563(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now R.S.C., 1985, c.
C-46 , s. 634(2) ) offends s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  Since the not
unlikely effect of the provision is to ensure a jury that at the very least
appears to be favourable to the Crown the section could not conceivably be
construed as a reasonable limit that can be justified in a free and democratic
society.  The section is therefore invalid.

 

                   The declaration of
invalidity resolves all future problems.  However in order to avoid a hiatus
the declaration should be suspended for a period of six months.  This will
provide an opportunity to Parliament to remedy the situation if it considers it
appropriate to do so.

 

                   The suspended
declaration does not leave the defence without a remedy during the interim. 
The accused may always attempt to demonstrate that there has been an abuse of
the stand by provisions by the prosecution.  This was the course successfully
followed in R. v. Pizzacalla, supra.  I would add that neither
the fact that relief may be obtained in this way, nor that many juries have in
the past been selected without the exercise of any prosecutional abuse, can be
accepted as a basis for defeating the constitutional challenge to the section. 
The fact remains that the impugned section legislates a means of selecting a
jury that could appear to be favourable to the Crown.  It can never be
forgotten that it is the jury that will determine guilt or innocence.  To
permit by legislation the selection of a jury apparently favourable to the
Crown offends not only the Charter  but a sense of basic fairness.

 

Disposition

 

                   I would declare
s. 563(2)  of the Criminal Code  (now s. 634(2) ) invalid but suspend
the declaration for a period of six months.  The appeal should be allowed, the
order of the Court of Appeal set aside and the acquittal of the appellant
restored.

 

                   The constitutional
questions should be answered as follows:

 

1.Are
ss. 633 and 634 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 
[formerly R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 562 and 563], inconsistent with ss. 7 ,
11 (d) or 15  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

A.Sections
634(1) and (2) (formerly R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 563(1) and (2)) are
inconsistent with s. 11 (d) in so far as they provide the Crown with
a combination of peremptory challenges and stand bys that is more than four
times in excess of the number of peremptory challenges permitted to an
accused.  It is unnecessary to consider whether this provision violates
s. 7 .  The allegation of a violation of s. 15  was withdrawn. 
Sections 633  and 634(3)  (formerly ss. 562 and 563(3)) were not challenged.

 

2.If
the answer to question 1 is affirmative, are ss. 633 and/or 634 [formerly
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 562 and/or 563] justified by s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution
Act, 1982 ?

 

A.
The violation is not justified under s. 1 .

 

//Gonthier J.//

 

                   The reasons of
Gonthier, McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ. were delivered by

 

                   Gonthier
J. (dissenting) -- The
appellant raises important questions about a central feature of our criminal
law system, the jury, and in particular about the mode of selection of the jury
contained in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  He submits that
the disparity between the means of challenge allowed to the accused and the
Crown in the jury selection process violates the constitutional guarantee of an
impartial tribunal contained in s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms .  I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of
Justice Stevenson and, while I respectfully find myself in disagreement
with them, I adopt his statement of the facts and judgments of the lower
courts.

 

                   For ease of
reference, I reproduce the relevant legislation:

 

Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms 

 

                   1.  The Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms  guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only
to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in
a free and democratic society.

 

                   10.  Everyone has the right on arrest or
detention

 

                                                                    ...

 

(b) 
to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right;
...

 

                   11.  Any person charged with an offence
has the right

 

                                                                    ...

 

(d) 
to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and
public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal;

 

Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34

 

                   562. (1)  An accused who is charged with
high treason or first degree murder is entitled to challenge twenty jurors
peremptorily.

 

                   (2) 
An accused who is charged with an offence, not being high treason or first
degree murder, for which he may be sentenced to imprisonment for more than five
years is entitled to challenge twelve jurors peremptorily.

 

                   (3) 
An accused who is charged with an offence that is not referred to in subsection
(1) or (2) is entitled to challenge four jurors peremptorily.

 

                   563.
(1)  The prosecutor
is entitled to challenge four jurors peremptorily, and may direct any number of
jurors who are not challenged peremptorily by the accused to stand by until all
the jurors have been called who are available for the purpose of trying the
indictment.

 

                   (2) 
Notwithstanding subsection (1), the prosecutor may not direct more than
forty-eight jurors to stand by unless the presiding judge for special cause to
be shown, so orders.

 

                   (3) 
The accused may be called upon to declare whether he challenges a juror
peremptorily or for cause before the prosecutor is called upon to declare
whether he requires the juror to stand by, or challenges him peremptorily or
for cause.

 

                   567.
(1)  A prosecutor or
an accused is entitled to any number of challenges on the ground that

 

(a)
the name of a juror does not appear on the panel, but no misnomer or
misdescription is a ground of challenge where it appears to the court that the
description given on the panel sufficiently designates the person referred to,

 

(b)
a juror is not indifferent between the Queen and the accused,

 

(c)
a juror has been convicted of an offence for which he was sentenced to death or
to a term of imprisonment exceeding twelve months,

 

(d)
a juror is an alien,

 

(e)
a juror is physically unable to perform properly the duties of a  juror, or

 

(f)
a juror does not speak the official language of Canada that is the language of
the accused ....

 

                   (2) 
No challenge for cause shall be allowed on a ground not mentioned in subsection
(1).

 

                   570.
(1)  Where, as a
result of challenges and directions to stand by, a full jury has not been sworn
and no names remain to be called, the names of those who have been directed to
stand by shall be called again in the order in which their names were drawn and
they shall be sworn, unless challenged by the accused, or unless the prosecutor
challenges them or shows cause why they should not be sworn.

 

                   (2) 
Where, before a juror is sworn pursuant to subsection (1), other jurors in
the panel become available, the prosecutor may require the names of those
jurors to be put into and drawn from the box in accordance with
section 560, and those jurors shall be challenged, ordered to stand by or
sworn, as the case may be, before the names of the jurors who were originally
ordered to stand by are called again. 

 

                   The constitutional
questions as they were framed by former Chief Justice Dickson on
June 7, 1989, put in issue the constitutionality of ss. 562  and
563  of the Criminal Code  (now R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , ss. 633  and 634 )
with respect to ss. 7 , 11 (d) and 15  of the Charter .  The
appellant concentrated his argument on s. 563(1) and (2) of the Code,
and did not address the validity of ss. 562  and 563(3) .  He did not make
any submissions as to s. 15  of the Charter  either.  The sole issue
before us remains therefore the consistency of s. 563(1)  and (2)  of the Criminal
Code  with ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  In their
factums and in argument, the parties did not make any specific arguments under
s. 7  of the Charter , relying instead on the arguments they had made
under s. 11 (d).

 

                   I agree with the
parties that, as regards independence and impartiality of the tribunal in
criminal cases, ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter  are
congruent.  Section 11 (d) of the Charter  merely enunciates a
particular aspect of the general protection against deprivations of the right
to life, liberty and security of the person found in s. 7  of the Charter ,
as had already suggested Lamer J. (as he then was) in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle
Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486.  Arguments made under s. 11 (d)
of the Charter  apply with equal force to s. 7 .  As this case was
argued under s. 11 (d) of the Charter , I will concentrate on
this section in my reasons, for the sake of convenience. 

 

I --The
Constitutionality of s. 563  of the Criminal Code  With Respect to s. 11 (d)
of the Charter 

 

The History of the Jury Selection
Process of the Criminal Code

 

                   Stevenson J. has
thoroughly explained in his reasons the present system of jury selection and
its historical origins.  I will only make two brief additional remarks.  First
of all, the stand by as it evolved in English law was indeed a deferred
challenge for cause.  The 1305 statute (An Ordinance for Inquests, 33
Ed. 1, c. 4) that abolished peremptory challenges for the Crown enacted that
the Crown shall only challenge for cause.  Stand bys were created through what
established itself as the current interpretation of the statute:  the Crown can
only challenge for cause, but it need not show cause before the entire jury
panel has been exhausted and a complete jury has not been sworn.  The Canadian
stand by operates slightly otherwise, since the Crown still can exercise
peremptory challenges under the Criminal Code .  The Code, in
s. 570(1) , acknowledges this by permitting peremptory challenges (even by
the accused) to be exercised against a stood by juror.  The Canadian stand by
could therefore be better qualified as a deferred consideration of the
prospective juror.

 

                   Furthermore, I wish
to stress that Parliament, in enacting An Act to amend the Criminal Code
(respecting jurors), S.C. 1917, c. 13, did not eliminate stand bys.  A
maximum of 48 was imposed on the number of stand bys that could be directed by
the Crown without leave of the Court, but Parliament did not see fit to abolish
stand bys altogether.  Some significance must be attached to this, since one of
the main reasons why a maximum number was enacted was the fear of abuses by the
Crown, even though no record of such abuse was put forward during the House
debates.  To prevent possible abuses, Parliament limited the number of
Crown stand bys and introduced control by the Court of any additional requests,
but it certainly saw a beneficial use to them that surpassed the perceived risk
for abuse, since they were kept in the Criminal Code .

 

The Relationship Between Peremptory
Challenges and Stand Bys

 

                   As a preliminary
matter, I have one comment on the central assumption underpinning the
appellant's argument:  that Crown stand bys are often in effect equivalent to
peremptory challenges, since the jury panels are in most jurisdictions so large
that they are never exhausted and the need to recall stood by jurors is almost
never felt.  Yet the various provincial acts either make the size of jury
panels discretionary (see for instance Juries Act, R.S.O. 1980,
c. 226, s. 12; Jury Act, S.A. 1982, c. J-2.1, s. 7; Jury
Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 210, s. 9; Jury Act, R.S.P.E.I.
1988, c. J-5, s. 11; The Jury Act, R.S.M. 1987, c. J30,
s. 17; Jury Act, S.N.B. 1980, c. J‑3.1, s. 13 and The
Jury Act 1981, S.S. 1980-81, c. J-4.1, s. 6) or leave some
discretion to vary the prescribed number (see for instance Jurors Act,
R.S.Q., c. J-2, s. 15; The Jury Act, S.N. 1980, c. 41,
s. 17, or Juries Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 242, s. 6).  The
Court cannot assess the size of such panels from the statutes themselves, and
it certainly may not be assumed to have judicial notice of the size of panels
throughout the judicial districts in Canada.  The assertions of the appellant
should be supported by at least some evidence.  In the case at bar, none of the
parties has sought to adduce evidence as to the size of jury panels in Canada
and the frequency of challenges and stand bys.  When the parties present
arguments based on the Charter , particularly on issues such as
impartiality and independence, a proper factual basis, supported by evidence,
is essential.  As this Court wrote in MacKay v. Manitoba, [1989]
2 S.C.R. 357, at p. 361:

 

                   Charter decisions should not and must not be
made in a factual vacuum.  To attempt to do so would trivialize the Charter 
and inevitably result in ill-considered opinions.  The presentation of facts is
not ... a mere technicality; rather, it is essential to a proper consideration
of Charter  issues.

 

This Court insisted on the need for
facts again in Danson v. Ontario (Attorney General), [1990]
2 S.C.R. 1086.  It is to the advantage of the parties to give this
Court the means to reach a decision on the issues.  Fortunately, these reasons
do not depend on whether Crown peremptory challenges and stand bys are
distinguishable or not in practice, and hence it will be assumed for the sake
of argument that they are not.

 

The Test for Impartiality Under the
Charter

 

                   In an inquiry under
the Charter , the appropriate test for impartiality was set out by this
Court in R. v. Lippé, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 114, where the Court adopted the
test first enunciated by de Grandpré J. in Committee for Justice
and Liberty v. National Energy Board, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369, and
reaffirmed in Valente v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 673.  This
test states that ""the apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held
by reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to the question and
obtaining thereon the required information"" (by de Grandpré J.,
at p. 394).  De Grandpré J. added in the next paragraph, at
p. 395, that ""[t]he grounds for this apprehension must, however, be
substantial ....""

 

                   Lippé, supra, also confirmed at p.
140 that ""[j]ust as the requirement of judicial independence has both an
individual and institutional aspect ... so too must the requirement of judicial
impartiality"".  The applicable test for institutional impartiality was
outlined by the Chief Justice in the following terms, at p. 144:

 

                   Step
One:  Having regard for a number of factors including, but not limited to, the
nature of the occupation and the parties who appear before this type of judge,
will there be a reasonable apprehension of bias in the mind of a fully informed
person in a substantial number of cases?

 

                   Step
Two:  If the answer to that question is no, allegations of an apprehension of
bias cannot be brought on an institutional level, but must be dealt with on a
case-by-case basis.  [Emphasis in the original.]

 

The appellant claims that s. 563
of the Code violates the Charter  guarantees of institutional
impartiality.  In effect, he asserts that a well-informed observer would find
that Crown peremptory challenges and stand bys give rise to a reasonable
apprehension of bias in a substantial number of cases.  This standard
requires more than just a perception of risk:  there must be, in the normal
operation of s. 563 of the Code, as it is applied in fact, a
serious fear that partial juries will result too often to be explained solely
by factors pertaining to each individual situation.

 

                   My aim in placing
such emphasis on the meaning of institutional partiality is not to render it
nugatory by imposing an insuperable burden on the applicant for Charter 
review.  Indeed in Lippé, supra, the mere fact that municipal
court judges were also practising lawyers would have been a sufficient basis
for finding a violation of the guarantees of institutional impartiality but for
safeguards provided by the legislation.  An allegation of institutional
partiality remains however a serious one:  in its generality, it implies that
the legal framework surrounding the institution in question is itself flawed,
irrespective of the particular circumstances of the various cases.

 

                   In the case at bar,
it is not sufficient, for a determination under s. 11 (d) of the Charter ,
simply to take notice of the disparity between the Crown and the accused in the
jury selection process and then to conclude that a reasonable apprehension of
bias arises.  The right minded observer described in the above paragraph must
put his or her mind to the question and acquire some information to enlighten
his or her opinion.  This observer knows better than the person on the street. 
He or she reads more than just the headlines.  In making up his or her mind
about the jury selection process, he or she must be expected to have sought
knowledge and to have thought about the formation of jury panels, about the
roles the parties play in the jury selection process and about the relationship
between the formation of the jury and the trial as a whole.

 

The Formation of Jury Panels

 

                   Jury trials are a
central element of Anglo-American criminal law.  Sometimes lauded, sometimes
vilified, trial by jury has withstood the test of time and has acquired such an
importance that it has been entrenched in our Constitution through s. 11 (f)
of the Charter .  Juries give a human side to criminal trials.  The many
purposes served by jury trials have been canvassed by the Law Reform Commission
of Canada in its 1980 Working Paper, The Jury in Criminal Trials, and
they have been touched upon by this Court in R. v. Sherratt, [1991] 1
S.C.R. 509.

 

                   In Sherratt,
supra, this Court has also elaborated on some of the fundamental
characteristics a jury must possess to exercise its duty properly, that is
impartiality and representativeness.  On the relationship between them,
Justice L'Heureux‑Dubé wrote at pp. 525-26 of her reasons
for judgment:

 

Provincial
legislation guarantees representativeness, at least in the initial array.  The
random selection process, coupled with the sources from which this selection is
made, ensures the representativeness of Canadian criminal juries....  Thus,
little if any objection can be made regarding this crucial characteristic of
juries.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   However,
the ""in-court"" selection procedure, set out in the Criminal Code ,
can impact on the representativeness of the jury in some situations.  The
impartiality of the jury is controlled in the main through the Criminal Code 
procedure.

 

                   It could be said
that random selection, which favours representativeness, provides as well a
certain guarantee that the jury will also be impartial, but this is by no means
true in all cases.  Randomness is not a panacea.  Indeed, in order to bolster
the impartiality of the jury, the Criminal Code  offers to the parties
various means of challenging prospective jurors, whether collectively or
individually, at ss. 558  (now s. 629 ), 562 (now s. 633 ), 563 (now s. 634 ) and
567 (now s. 638 ) of the Code.  In Sherratt, supra, the
majority of this Court has recognized that these challenges contribute to the
impartiality of the jury and sometimes even improve its representativeness.

 

                   A further quality of
a proper jury that has not been discussed in Sherratt, supra, is
competence.  Jurors should not only be representative and impartial, they
should also be able to understand the trial, their role in the trial, the
evidence that is presented, the principles they have to apply, among other
things.  This requirement of competence is not mentioned in relevant
legislation, aside from general requirements of mental health and linguistic
capability, but it is implicit.  Most trials require the same competence as is
involved in the daily pursuit of one's affairs, and the ability to speak and
understand one of the official languages will suffice.  Some trials are more
complex and complicated, however, especially in the area of economic crimes, to
name only one, and then a tampering with randomness may be appropriate to
achieve a minimal ability to understand the evidence and issues.

 

                   The well-informed
observer certainly knows that a jury should be impartial, representative and
competent.  He or she will also know that the random selection process that
leads to the formation of a panel of prospective jurors naturally fosters these
three qualities, but that it does not in and of itself guarantee them. 
Procedures exist through which parties are granted a limited possibility of
affecting jury selection to further any of these characteristics.  Of these
procedures, challenges to the jury panel and challenges for cause are not at
issue here.

 

                   The appellant
raises doubts about peremptory challenges and Crown stand bys only.  The
observer would accordingly inquire as to whether any apparent justification for
the disparity between the accused and the Crown can be found in the rationales
behind these recourses, and whether there is any link, or appearance of link,
between the selection process and the impartiality of the jury.

 

The Rationales for Peremptory
Challenges and Stand Bys

 

                   The well-informed
observer will know about the role of the accused and the Crown in the jury
selection process, and he or she can draw inferences about the rationales for
their respective recourses therefrom.

 

                   The Role of the
Accused

 

                   The accused has a
fairly clear and circumscribed role in the trial and in the jury selection
process.  Nothing more is expected of him or her than trying to avoid
conviction and punishment by asserting his or her rights according to law.

 

                   The accused has no
right to a jury of his or her choice, however, as was recognized by the
majority of this Court in Sherratt, supra.  As long as the jury
selection process produces an impartial jury, the accused has no claim to any
greater influence on the jury than is given him or her by this process.  He or
she cannot positively choose the jury, but the law allows him or her to exclude
prospective jurors from it.

 

                   The Criminal
Code  gives the accused a variable number of peremptory challenges,
depending on the seriousness of the offence.  These peremptory challenges allow
the accused to exclude prospective jurors from the jury.  The main rationale
for these had already been outlined by Blackstone, in his Commentaries on
the Laws of England, Lewis ed., vol. 4, at p. 353 and p. 1738 (of
Lewis' Edition):

 

[The
peremptory challenge] is grounded on two reasons.  i.  As every one must be sensible what sudden impressions and
unaccountable prejudices we are apt to conceive upon the bare looks and
gestures of another, and how necessary it is that a prisoner (when put to
defend his life) should have a good opinion of his jury, the want of which
might totally disconcert him, the law wills not that he should be tried by any
one man against whom he has conceived a prejudice, even without being able to
assign a reason for such his dislike.  2.  Because,
upon challenges for cause shown, if the reasons assigned prove insufficient to
set aside the juror, perhaps the bare questioning his indifference may
sometimes provoke a resentment, to prevent all ill consequences from which the
prisoner is still at liberty, if he pleases, peremptorily to set him aside.

 

                   These are still
today the main reasons offered to justify peremptory challenges by the
accused.  Babcock, in ""Voir Dire:  Preserving `Its Wonderful Power'""
(1975), 27 Stan. L. Rev. 545, names them respectively the
""didactic"" and ""shield"" functions of the peremptory
challenge at pp. 552-55.  Professor Babcock develops the didactic function
of the challenge further than Blackstone:  not only does it allow the accused
to summarily dismiss prospective jurors without specific motives, but it also
""teaches the litigant, and through him the community, that the jury is a
good and proper mode for deciding matters and that its decision should be followed
because in a real sense the jury belongs to the litigant..."" (at
p. 552).  The ""shield"" function remains accessory.  The Law
Reform Commission of Canada, in its 1982 report, The Jury, also
explained peremptory challenges for the accused along the same lines at
p. 46.

 

                   The Role of the
Crown

 

                   The role of the
Crown in the jury selection process, as in the trial as a whole, is not only
different, but also asymmetrical.

 

In
General

 

                   In the criminal
process, the Crown Attorney is not expected to seek conviction above everything
else, just like the accused attempts to avoid conviction.  He or she has
special duties in his or her quality as a public officer.  Additional duties
are superadded to his or her duties as representative of the prosecution side,
duties that will often lead to conflicts with the course of action that another
lawyer, acting for an individual party, would take, and that will therefore
impose limits on prosecutorial conduct.

 

                   As Bull put it, in
his address ""The Career Prosecutor in Canada"" (1962), 53 J. Crim. L.C.
& P.S. 89, at p. 95:

 

                   He,
then, is the attorney for the people or the State against the accused in a
proceeding in which the State dissociates itself from the act of its own
member, denunciating his conduct and exhibiting an antagonism in its will
against the will of the wrong-doer.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   The
Crown Attorney however is something more.  The Crown embraces the whole of the
state including the wrong-doer himself.  On the one hand, the monarch ...
guarantees that the subject shall enjoy peace -- the Queen's Peace.  On the
other hand the monarch has repeatedly guaranteed to every subject ... the right
of fair trial and due process of law.

 

The inherent richness and complexity
of the prosecutor's role was also brought to the fore in R. v. Savion and
Mizrahi (1980), 52 C.C.C. (2d) 276, where the Ontario Court of Appeal held
at p. 289:

 

By
reason of the nature of our adversary [sic] system of trial, a Crown
prosecutor is an advocate; he is entitled to discharge his duties with
industry, skill and vigour.  Indeed, the public is entitled to expect
excellence in a Crown prosecutor just as an accused person expects excellence
in his counsel.  But a Crown prosecutor is more than an advocate, he is a
public officer engaged in the administration of justice ....

 

                   With respect to the
nature of the duties of Crown prosecutors, the Ontario Court of Appeal in the
above case referred to Boucher v. The Queen, [1955] S.C.R. 16, the
seminal pronouncement of this Court on the subject.  There Rand J. wrote
this oft‑quoted passage at pp. 23-24:

 

                   It
cannot be over-emphasized that the purpose of a criminal prosecution is not to
obtain a conviction, it is to lay before a jury what the Crown considers to be
credible evidence relevant to what is alleged to be a crime.  Counsel have a
duty to see that all available legal proof of the facts is presented:  it
should be done firmly and pressed to its legitimate strength but it must also
be done fairly.  The role of prosecutor excludes any notion of winning or
losing; his function is a matter of public duty than which in civil life there
can be none charged with greater personal responsibility.  It is to be
efficiently performed with an ingrained sense of the dignity, the seriousness
and the justness of judicial proceedings.

 

                   (See also R. v.
Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326.)

 

Taschereau J. (as he then was) also
dealt with the general issue of prosecutorial responsibilities in these terms
at p. 21:

 

                   [translation]  The position of Crown
counsel is not that of counsel in a civil matter.  His functions are
quasi-judicial.  He must not so much try to obtain a conviction as assist the
judge and jury so that justice will be fully done.  Moderation and impartiality
must always characterize his conduct in court.  He will have honestly carried
out his duty and will be beyond reproach if, putting aside any appeal to the
passions, in a dignified manner appropriate to his role, he presents the
evidence to the jury without going beyond what it has revealed.

 

These words remain every bit as
pertinent today as they were then and as they had been before.  Since Crown
prosecutors play a central role in the proper functioning of our judicial
system, and since they are vested with much discretion and subject to few
controls, their duties can never be too often reaffirmed.  The single‑minded
pursuit of convictions cannot be compatible with the responsibilities of Crown
prosecutors.  They must present the case for the prosecution to the best of
their ability, always acting in furtherance of the duties entrusted to their
office.  The examination of the role of Crown Attorneys in criminal trials
cannot be better concluded than with this passage from Hilbery, Duty and Art
in Advocacy, at p. 13:

 

[A
prosecutor's duty is] to see to it that every material point is made which
supports the prosecution case or destroys the case put forward for the
defence.  But as prosecuting Counsel he should not regard his task as one of
winning the case.  He is an officer of justice.  He must present the case
against the prisoner relentlessly, but with scrupulous fairness.  He is not to
make merely forensic points or debating scores.  There is, perhaps, no occasion
when the Barrister is called upon to exhibit a nicer sense of his
responsibilities than when prosecuting.

 

During
the Jury Selection Process

 

                   In keeping with
this quasi-judicial role, the Crown prosecutor in the jury selection process
has a duty to ensure that the jury presents the three characteristics outlined
above, that is impartiality, representativeness and competence.  Let it be made
clear, however, that these qualities, especially impartiality, must not be
sought in light of securing a conviction, but rather in light of selecting the
best jury to try the case.  Indeed the Crown Attorney should use the means at
his or her disposal to exclude prospective jurors that could be biased in
favour of the prosecution, even if the defence is not aware of this fact.  The
""didactic"" function that was attached to the peremptory challenge for
the accused is absent in the case of the Crown:  it does not have to develop
any sense of adherence to or acceptance of the trial process through the
selection of the jury, and accordingly neither does it have any interest in
excluding candidates on the basis of unsupported perceptions.  The Crown
Attorney's only justification for taking part in the jury selection process
stems from his or her responsibilities as a public officer.

 

                   The Crown
nevertheless has an important function to fulfil during jury selection.  This
function can better be understood by comparison with other jurisdictions.

 

                   In the United
States, the trial judge generally retains a wide discretion to excuse
prospective jurors at the outset of the trial on grounds deemed by him or her
sufficient (Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Hill, 237 U.S. 208
(1915); in federal procedure, this principle is embodied in 28 U.S.C. §
1866(c)(2)).  Afterwards, jury selection involves extensive questioning during
a voir dire where jurors can be asked various questions, in order to
enable the parties to gain sufficient information for their challenges for
cause.  Furthermore, the range of causes for which a juror can be excluded is
virtually limitless, since U.S. courts have repeatedly held that States cannot
limit an accused's constitutional right to a fair trial by purporting to enact
a closed list of causes for challenge (the evolution of American law on this
issue is discussed in Jordan, Jury Selection, at pp. 49-55.  A
large measure of flexibility can therefore be found both in the discretion
given to the trial judge and in the unlimited number of grounds of challenge
for cause.  This flexibility allows for special cases of juror inaptitude to be
dealt with as they arise in particular cases, hence enabling the selection
process to produce a jury that conforms to constitutional guarantees.

 

                   In the United
Kingdom, the Juries Act 1974, 1974, c. 23, gives a designated
officer of the court a general power to excuse (at s. 9) or to defer
attendance (at s. 9(2)), when jurors put forward a good reason to do so. 
At trial, the court itself has a power to excuse for good reason prospective
jurors from their jury duties (s. 9(4) of the Juries Act 1974), and
it also retains a common law power to refuse to allow to be sworn prospective
jurors who are incapable of duly attending to the evidence (Mansell v. The
Queen (1857), 8 El. & Bl. 54, 120 E.R. 20).  At common law, the grounds
for challenge for cause are limited, not unlike in Canada.  In the United
Kingdom, the flexibility to deal with individual jurors whose qualifications
may be problematic comes from these broad powers given to the court officer in
charge of constituting the panels and to the trial court.  A further element of
flexibility comes from Crown stand bys, which in English law have been severely
curtailed by guidelines from the Attorney General (published at ""Practice
Note"", [1988] 3 All E.R. 1086).  These guidelines recognize at paragraph 4
that, given the discretionary powers outlined above, stand bys will be
necessary only in rare cases.  Despite the differences in Canadian law that
will be outlined below, it is of the utmost interest to note the underlying
principles to Crown stand bys, as stated in paragraph I:

 

                   I. 
Although the law has long recognised the right of the Crown to exclude a member
of a jury panel from sitting as a juror by the exercise in open court of the
right to request a stand by or, if necessary, by challenge for cause, it has
been customary for those instructed to prosecute on behalf of the Crown to
assert that right only sparingly and in exceptional circumstances.  It is
generally accepted that the prosecution should not use its right in order to
influence the overall composition of a jury or with a view to tactical
advantage.

 

                   In Canada,
constitutional considerations intervene.  As this Court has held in R. v.
Barrow, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 694, at pp. 712-13, ""the provincial
power for the administration of justice stops and the federal power over
criminal procedure begins when the judge's activity is not concerned with the
assembly of an array of eligible citizens, but with the precautions necessary
to ensure an impartial jury"".  The Court wrote also at p. 713 that
""its [the province's] authority over the jury pool is limited to
eligibility and personal matters unconnected with the criminal case to be
tried"".  The element of flexibility that was found in American and English
law must therefore be found in the provisions of the Criminal Code .

 

                   In the Code,
not only is there a list of grounds for challenge for cause in s. 567(1) 
of the Criminal Code , but this list is closed by s. 567(2) of the Code. 
The scope for challenges for cause is therefore limited, unlike in American
law.  Furthermore, pre‑screening of prospective jurors through direct
questioning from the judge is confined to obvious cases where consent of
counsel can be presumed, following the strand of case law culminating in Sherratt,
supra.  Canadian law does not give the trial judges powers to excuse of
the same breadth as in the United States or the United Kingdom.  It does not
put this necessary element of flexibility, in dealing with particular
prospective jurors in particular cases, in the hands of the court or of court
officers.

 

                   Whereas the United
States and the United Kingdom rely on the trial judge's discretion or extensive
challenge for cause procedures, the Canadian solution to this problem is to
allow the Crown, through means put at its disposal, to exclude a prospective
juror from the jury.  Therein lies the role of the Crown in the Canadian jury
selection process.  Through this role, in conformity with its general duties,
the Crown addresses the need to be able to exclude prospective jurors who would
not fall under any of the statutory grounds of exclusion but whose presence on
the jury would nevertheless impair its impartiality, its representativeness or
its competence.  It provides the element of flexibility.

 

                   The means provided
by the Code for the exercise of Crown duties during jury selection is
s. 563 , where the prosecutor receives powers of peremptory challenge and
stand by.  As mentioned previously, it is significant that Parliament, when it 
last addressed the issue of stand bys in 1917, did not choose to abolish them
but rather to establish a uniform limit in numbers beyond which judicial
authorization is required.  Crown stand bys (the same reasoning can be applied
to peremptory challenges) had then and still have a function and an importance
of their own in the jury selection process.

 

                   The relatively
large number of challenges and stand bys given to the Crown is consistent with
the need for flexibility in the process.  It is not incumbent upon the Court to
inquire into the adequacy of the actual numbers contained in the Code.

 

                   They are the result
of historical compromises.  The 48 stand bys, for instance, represent an
average of the number of persons on jury panels in the nine provinces at the
time of the enactment of the Act to amend the Criminal Code (respecting
jurors).  Whether the figure of 48 is properly determined and whether it is
still adequate today are questions better left for Parliament to decide.  Irrespective
of the precise number, though, this relatively high figure, and consequently
the possibility of a large number of Crown interventions in jury selection,
enables the Crown fully to play its role when the situation so requires.  The
Crown will not exercise all of its four challenges and 48 stand bys merely
because it holds them.  In fact, a proper exercise of its role would call for
restraint.  Since the Crown plays this important quasi-judicial role and
infuses some flexibility into the jury selection process, however, it is only
normal that the means of exclusion at its disposal also allow some room for
manoeuvre.  Moreover, the limit of 48 itself is flexible, since upon judicial
authorization it can be increased.

 

                   As a result, in my
view, the well-informed observer, who knows that the accused and the Crown play
different roles in the jury selection process, would not hold a reasonable
apprehension of bias from the mere fact that a disparity in the number of
recourses against jurors exists in the Criminal Code .  He or she would
see in this disparity a reflection of the asymmetry between the roles of the
accused, which is limited, going almost to self-preservation in nature, and of
the Crown Attorney, who must conscientiously discharge the quasi-judicial
duties incumbent on his or her public office and who accordingly requires some
flexibility in the means available to him or her.  He or she might well
consider that this disparity contributes to a better jury by fostering its
impartiality, representativeness and competence.  This line of reasoning has
been followed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Stoddart (1987),
37 C.C.C. (3d) 351, by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in R. v. Johnstone
(1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 401, and by the Quebec Court of Appeal in Mansbridge
v. R. (October 1, 1991), Quebec 200‑10‑000149‑851 (C.A.),
JE 91‑1653.

 

The Link Between the Selection of the
Jury and its Impartiality

 

                   Furthermore, the
observer would fail in my view to see any clear link between the jury selection
process and the impartiality of the empanelled jury.

 

                   The appellant's
central tenet is that the verdict of the jury can be influenced at the stage of
selection.   The parties, by exerting an influence on who is empanelled on the
jury, can fashion a jury to their liking.  In this respect, the greater
possibility for influence given to the Crown would allow it to model the jury
more than could the accused.  However, notwithstanding whether they are
effective or not, such systematic attempts by the Crown at hand-picking the
jury to obtain a conviction would be contrary to its role in the jury selection
process and an abuse of its powers.  Even for the accused, the kind of
deliberate planning involved with such overt jury shaping must be contrasted
with the attitude envisioned by the ""didactic"" rationale mentioned
above, where the accused voices his or her sudden perceptions and prejudices.

 

                   Factual Basis

 

                   Many studies have
been conducted on the relationship between peremptory challenges and jury
verdicts in the United States, but their relevance is very limited since the
American jury selection procedure generally comprises an extensive voir dire
where prospective jurors are questioned in order to provide parties with
sufficient information for the selection process.  Attempts to shape the
verdict during selection rest on a sounder scientific basis in the United
States, where parties will know after the voir dire how jurors think
about certain issues, how they think about the crime with which the accused is
charged, among others.  Even then, American studies remain fairly divided on
the existence of any link between jury selection and verdicts.

 

                   In Canada, the
information available to the parties during the selection process is very
limited:  aside from apparent features such as gender, race or age, parties are
only provided with the names and occupations of prospective jurors.  It is not
apparent that parties can influence the verdict by challenging or standing by prospective
jurors, given this dearth of information.

 

                   Both parties have
cited an English study, which could be taken with caution as the most
applicable empirical work.  In this study, titled ""The Use of Peremptory
Challenge and Stand by of Jurors and their Relationship to Trial Outcome"",
[1988]  Crim. L.R. 731, authors Vennard and Riley tried to
determine if the use by defendants of their peremptory challenges could
increase their chances of acquittal.  A quotation from their conclusions at
p. 738 sheds some light on the lack of factual foundation for the
appellant's claim:

 

...
the findings do not lend support to the criticism that peremptory challenge
gives an unfair advantage to the defence and that juries subjected to challenge
are predisposed to acquit.  Bearing in mind the uncertainty of peremptory
challenge as a means of influencing the composition of the jury to achieve a
favourable outcome, the lack of association is, perhaps, to be expected. 
First, it must be remembered that the pool of potential jurors for each
defendant is limited to those members of the public who comprise the jury panel
on that day.  In addition, any attempt to affect the outcome through challenge
relies on subjective judgments about the relationship between a potential juror's
age, sex and appearance and his or her propensity to convict or acquit.

 

                   Of course, I do not
consider that jurors come to their task with a completely blank slate, devoid
of any preconceptions and prejudices.  Each juror has his or her own particular
mind set, and it forms part of his or her representative quality.  It must be
emphasized, however, that parties who try to fashion the jury through the
selection process play the sorcerer's apprentice.  The appellant cannot claim
that these attempts violate his rights under the Charter .

 

                   The well-informed
observer should not be expected to have read the most recent empirical studies
on jury selection.  Yet he or she will certainly see that there is little
practical relation between the excluded jurors and the impartiality of the jury
actually selected, and that Crown challenges and stand bys serve a legitimate
purpose and remain but one part of a criminal trial.

 

                   The Excluded
Jurors and the Jury Itself

 

                   This Court in Sherratt,
supra, recognized that tampering with the randomness of the jury roll at
the selection stage, through challenges and stand bys, was permissible and
did not in and of itself give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias, as was
mentioned above.

 

                   During the
selection process, both parties have at their disposal means to exclude jurors
summarily.  There is no indication, and the appellant does not contend, that
the number of peremptory challenges given to the accused is insufficient as
such.  The appellant complains only that the Crown has stand bys in great
numbers in addition to its peremptory challenges.  Since in addition to the
peremptory challenges the accused is unrestricted in challenging for cause, and
since the stand by procedure is an exclusionary mechanism, even its abuse,
while it might result in some qualified and impartial persons' being excluded,
does not lead to the choice of biased jurors.  The 12 jurors finally selected
will not appear to be partial to the Crown.  It cannot be inferred that those
challenged or stood by by the Crown were necessarily favourable to the
accused (even if it were so, the accused is not entitled to a favourable jury,
as was noted before).  Reciprocally, it cannot be concluded that a juror is
biased in favour of the Crown simply because the Crown has not exercised a
challenge or a stand by against him or her.

 

                   In the end, the 12
members of the jury, who have withstood the selection process, are the ones who
matter in examining whether a reasonable apprehension of bias arises.  The
accused as well as the Crown had the opportunity to exclude them somehow as
they were called, if they had any doubt on their fitness to serve as jurors. 
To the observer, this feature of the jury selection process not only does not
give rise to an apprehension of bias, but rather increases the perception that
the jury is impartial, since the accused and the Crown have had a chance to
weed out the jury.

 

                   In R. v. Ross
(1986), 53 C.R. (3d) 81 (Ont. H.C.), Potts J. adopted the same
approach, and he made the following statement at pp. 86-87:

 

                   When
one reviews the entire jury selection process, it becomes clear that the acts
complained of as being unfair are at the end of a rather lengthy process
designed to ensure randomness and independence and impartiality.  Can the
Crown's ability to request that a potential juror stand aside be seen to impugn
this entire process?  I respectfully submit that it cannot.  At best, the jury
selection carried on in a courtroom by counsel is educated guesswork operating
on a sample of strangers carefully chosen in a neutral fashion.  Does an
individual, chosen at random, who has survived the scrutiny of the accused
assume a pro-Crown bias merely because he is not asked by the Crown to stand
aside?  Does a jury composed of such individuals become something less than
""independent and impartial""?  Alternatively, does an individual who
is initially asked to stand aside but later recalled assume a pro-accused bias
merely because he had first been asked to stand aside?  I would respectfully
submit that the individual biases of any potential juror are left unaffected by
the Crown's request to stand aside or not.  Therefore, I find that the
independence and impartiality of the jury as a whole as it is finally selected
are not affected by the number of stand-asides which the Crown has or has
elected to use.  Although when viewed in isolation the Criminal Code  provisions
may appear to be unfair, I find that when the entire jury selection process is
reviewed the advantage to the Crown, while present, is slight; it certainly
does not constitute a rule which is so unfair that it results in an unfair
trial of the accused.

 

I cannot but agree with these words,
as did the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Stoddart, supra.

 

                   Peremptory
Challenges and Stand Bys Within the Criminal Trial

 

                   Moreover, the
likelihood that the impugned disparity had an influence on the jury clashes
squarely with other fundamental characteristics of criminal jury trials.

 

                   For one, the
verdict of the jury must be unanimous.  According to Lord Devlin, Trial
by Jury, at p. 48, this rule was established in 1367 and has remained
unchanged since.  In our criminal law, the jury only exists as a collectivity,
and not as a group of individuals.  Such a conception is borne out by empirical
findings as well.  In their book Jury Trials, Baldwin and McConville
conclude at pp. 104-105:

 

Having
examined the relationship between the characteristics of juries and the
verdicts they return, we can confidently state that no single social factor
(nor, as far as we could detect, any group of factors operating in combination)
produced any significant variation in the verdicts returned across the board. 
This negative conclusion is, to a degree, a surprising one since common sense
and a voluminous literature would have suggested the opposite.  The
contradiction is, however, relatively easily explained.  The truth of the
matter is that most juries ... were extremely mixed, and it is to be expected that
the amalgam of personal and social attributes that make up a jury will produce
verdicts which reflect that unique social mix rather than the broad social
characteristics of the individuals concerned.

 

Any attempt to influence the verdict
of the jury by hand-picking its members, unless it can be done on such a grand
scale as to affect the whole jury, is bound to run against the unanimity
requirement, and its efficacy may therefore be highly doubted by the observer.

 

                   Furthermore, the
parties to a criminal trial both try to convince the jury to adopt their
conclusions.  The criminal trial as a whole is an adversarial process, designed
to lay before the jury all the evidence and all the arguments that are relevant
to its decision.  If the verdict could be determined at the jury selection
stage, the trial would serve little purpose.  Crown challenges and stand bys
are part of a larger trial procedure conceived to allow the culpability of the
accused to be debated, while remaining fair to the accused.  The burden of
proof requirements, the evidentiary exclusions and the defences open to the
accused all contribute to these objectives.  In arguing that a mere disparity
in the jury selection process suffices to predetermine the verdict and to
render the whole trial unfair, the appellant denies the very essence of the
trial.

 

                   These
considerations were behind one of the earliest pronouncements on the issue,
found in R. v. Piraino (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 28 (Ont. H.C.), at
pp. 29-30:

 

                   The
jury selection process is just one step in the trial.  The course of a trial is
governed and affected by almost countless rules relating to procedure and the
admissibility of evidence.  Many of those rules when isolated and looked at
individually, would appear to favour either the Crown or the accused.  Indeed,
the same rule may at one point favour the Crown and at another point favour the
accused.  Others of those rules consistently favour either the Crown or the
accused.  The requirements; that the Crown prove each element of a charge
beyond a reasonable doubt before there can be a conviction; that the accused
cannot be required to testify and that the Crown and the trial judge may not
comment on the fact that the accused has not testified are examples of rules
that favour the accused.

 

                   In
my view, so far as the issue before me is concerned, the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  gives to every citizen the right to a fair trial.  It
does not assure him the right that every rule that governs that trial, when
examined individually, be fair to him.  It does, however, assure him that any
individual rule that is so unfair that it will result in an unfair trial being
had will be struck down.

 

The above reasoning has been echoed by
the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Stoddart, supra, by the
Quebec Court of Appeal in R. v. Bolduc  (1986), 4 Q.A.C. 201,
and by the Newfoundland Court of Appeal in R. v. Curtis (1989), 74 Nfld.
& P.E.I.R. 227.  I would also adopt it.  One must beware, of course,
of excusing violations of the Charter  in criminal procedure on the
grounds that our system of criminal trial as a whole is fair.  As was said in Piraino,
some rules may be so unfair that they will be struck down.

 

                   In the case at bar,
however, the well-informed observer, knowing the qualities expected in a good
jury (impartiality, representativeness and competence), understands the
difference between the roles of the accused and the Crown in the jury selection
process as well as the tenuous relationship of peremptory challenges and stand bys
with the impartiality of the jury and the fairness of the trial as a whole. 
Considering these factors, a disparity in the means afforded to the parties
does not create in him or her an apprehension that the jury is systematically
partial because of the operation of the provisions of the Criminal Code .

 

Institutional and Individual
Impartiality

 

                   Fundamentally, the
appellant's position is based on an apprehension of abuse or misuse by the
Crown of its powers in a substantial number of cases, which would impinge upon
the impartiality of the empanelled jury at the institutional level.  I have
just outlined my reasons for finding that this submission must fail in the
absence of any reasonable apprehension of bias in the eyes of a well-informed
observer.  Throughout, I remained at the level of pure
""apprehension"", and I did not consider, apart from the question of
whether an apprehension could arise on the face of the Criminal Code 
provisions, whether there was any support, judicial, doctrinal or otherwise,
for the appellant's alleged apprehension.

 

                   No evidence has
been presented of an abusive Crown practice.  It is to be noted, as was
mentioned above, that Parliament chose to limit and maintain Crown
stand bys in 1917, and not to abolish them, amid the fears of abuse
expressed by some members.  The British Parliament, when it enacted the Criminal
Justice Act 1988 (U.K.), 1988, c. 33, which abolished the peremptory
challenges that remained to the accused, also avoided to abolish Crown
stand bys, on the grounds that they serve a valid purpose, as outlined in
the Attorney General's guidelines, supra.  Furthermore, but for one
trial court case, Canadian courts, in particular at the appellate level, have
always upheld s. 563  of the Criminal Code .  None of them found any
substance in allegations of institutional partiality.  Finally, at the
doctrinal level, but for the slight editorial piece of Mewett, ""The Jury
Stand-By"" (1988), 30 Crim. L.Q. 385, no Canadian
authors of which I am aware have reviewed the issue since the Law Reform
Commission of Canada issued its report, The Jury, supra, in 1982.

 

                   The Commission's
brief remarks on peremptory challenges and stand bys, at p. 47 of its
report, show that it did not consider that the Code provisions were
unfair to the accused, although it suggested the abolition of stand bys,
and their replacement by an increased number of peremptory challenges, on the
basis that they were obsolete and anachronistic.  In the realm of independence
and impartiality, however, the Charter  does not require perfection, as
has been mentioned on several occasions by this Court (see Valente v. The
Queen, supra, and the recent case of R. v. Lippé, supra;
as for s. 563 of the Code, specifically, see R. v. Foote
(1985), 65 N.B.R. 444 (C.A.)).  The constitutional validity of
s. 563  of the Criminal Code  does not mean that it is exempt from
criticism.  Many avenues for its reform and the reform of the jury selection
process have been proposed.  I do not wish to comment on them.  Absent Charter
violations, this Court has no mandate to engage in law reform.

 

                   The appellant's
arguments amount to suggesting that jury trials conducted under the provisions
of the Criminal Code  have in a substantial number of cases been unfair
to the accused or at least given rise to an apprehension of unfairness.  Far be
it from me to give in to the sheer weight of history, but trial by jury remains
such a central and cherished feature of our criminal law that it would seem
somewhat incongruous that many juries to date (or at least many of those
selected after Crown challenges and stand bys were exercised) would be so
fundamentally flawed.  It would be regrettable to invalidate s. 563 of the
Code on the basis of such sweeping assertions, thereby also defeating the
legitimate and useful purposes for which it has been enacted.

 

                   Should the
possibility of abuse advanced by the appellant materialize in instant cases,
where the Crown rather than fulfilling its duty would misuse or abuse its
powers, these could be adequately dealt with on an individual basis.

 

                   In the United
States, it is true, problems have arisen with the use of peremptory challenges
by the prosecution to exclude blacks from the jury.  In Batson v. Kentucky,
476 U.S. 79 (1986), the Supreme Court of the United States has held that in
these situations the accused has a recourse against the prosecution if
discrimination is proven.  Canada has largely been spared these prosecutorial
practices, but if they occur, the common law and the Charter offer
sufficient protection to the accused (see Hébert, ""Le contrôle judiciaire
de certains pouvoirs de la couronne"", in Droit pénal -- orientations
nouvelles, and Morgan, ""Controlling Prosecutorial Powers -- Judicial
Review, Abuse of Process and Section 7  of the Charter "" (1986),
29 Crim. L.Q. 15).  Although the right of the Crown to
stand by jurors is not such as to give rise to a reasonable apprehension
of partiality in a substantial number of cases, should a case occur in which
the use of stand bys by the Crown is such as to create a reasonable
apprehension of partiality, a court must be mindful that the purpose of the Charter 
is the unremitting protection of individual rights and liberties -- Hunter
v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p. 155.  It will be up to the
trial judge to ensure that the prosecution is not abusing its power of
stand bys, and to allay any apprehension as to impartiality.  This was the
approach apparently taken by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Pizzacalla
(1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 783.  In that case, counsel for the Crown used 20
stand bys for the admitted purpose of empanelling an all‑female jury
for the trial of a man accused of sexual assault.  The Court of Appeal allowed
the appeal from conviction and ordered a new trial.

 

                   This ruling is
limited to s. 563(1)  and (2)  (now s. 634(1) and (2)) of the Code. 
As they now stand, they do not offend the constitutional guarantees of
impartiality secured by ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter . 
There was therefore no constitutional basis for the ruling made by the trial
judge in the instant case, restricting the Crown and the accused to four
peremptory challenges and depriving the Crown of its right to stand by
prospective jurors.

 

II
--The Consequences of the Trial Judge's Ruling on the Validity of the Trial

 

                   The appellant
submits that s. 686(1) (b)(iv) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 
1985, c. C-46 , can be used by an appellate court to cure the error that was
made by the trial judge in his order.

 

                   Section 686 of the Code
reads as follows:

 

                   686. (1) On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit, on
account of insanity, to stand trial, or against a special verdict of not guilty
on account of insanity, the court of appeal

 

                                                                    ...

 

(b)
may dismiss the appeal where

 

                                                                    ...

 

(iv)
notwithstanding any procedural irregularity at trial, the trial court had
jurisdiction over the class of offence of which the appellant was convicted and
the court of appeal is of the opinion that the appellant suffered no prejudice
thereby;

 

                   The appellant
relies on R. v. Cloutier (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 35, a
decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal.  There the accused had been excluded
from the courtroom in the course of the trial, in violation of s. 577 of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  After having reviewed and
distinguished precedents that had been decided before s. 613(1)(b)(iv)
of the Code (now s. 686(1) (b)(iv)) came into force, the Ontario
Court of Appeal discussed the intent of Parliament in enacting this section at
p. 46:

 

                   It
is appropriate to consider at this point, the purpose of the enactment of
s. 613(1)(b)(iv) [now s. 686(1) (b)(iv)].  At the very least
Parliament must have intended to give to the Court of Appeal a discretionary
power which it did not have previously.  It already had under s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
[now s. 686(1) (b)(iii)] the power to dismiss an appeal where a
mistake of law had occurred but the court was of the opinion that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred.  It was accordingly
not necessary to enact a provision to cover errors in nature of procedural
irregularities as they are by their very nature errors of law.

 

...
where the ground for an appeal was an error of law and that error of law was
the contravention of s. 577(1) [now s. 650(1), guaranteeing the right
of the accused to be present at the trial], such error resulted in a loss of
jurisdiction and the curative provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) did
not apply even though the error did not result in substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice.... A fortiori, if the ground of appeal was that
the court, in the first instance, had no jurisdiction over the class of offence
of which an appellant had been convicted, the Court of Appeal could not rely on
the provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii).

 

...
the inclusion of the words ""the trial court had jurisdiction over the
class of offence of which the appellant was convicted"" in s. 613(1)(b)(iv)
make it quite clear that the new provision was intended to give to the Court of
Appeal the discretionary power to dismiss an appeal where a court has
jurisdiction in the first instance but has lost jurisdiction as a result of
some procedural irregularity.

 

The Court of Appeal summed up its
reasoning at p. 48:

 

...
it is necessary to distinguish between (1) errors of substance such as exist in
cases where the court has no jurisdiction over the class of offences charged
and which are not procedural in nature at all; (2) irregularities in procedure
of a relatively minor nature which do not result in a loss of jurisdiction on
the part of the trial court, and (3) irregularities in procedure which are so
serious in nature that they are deemed to be matters of substance which result
in a loss of jurisdiction.

 

...
the wording of s. 613(1)(b)(iv) makes it clear that its curative
provisions do not apply to the first type of error.  It is equally clear that
its curative provisions do apply to the second type of error or irregularity
but that type of error could be dealt with under s. 613(1)(b)(iii). 
There would be no point in enacting s. 613(1)(b)(iv) for this
purpose.

 

...
the curative provisions do apply to the third type of error or irregularity. 
Although the third type of procedural irregularity is one that is so serious
that it is deemed to be fundamental in nature and results in a loss of
jurisdiction, it does nevertheless have its origin as a procedural irregularity
at trial.

 

                   I agree with this
interpretation of s. 686(1)(b)(iv) of the Code.  Parliament
clearly intended to limit annulments for jurisdictional grounds to cases where
prejudice to the accused has occurred, provided the court had jurisdiction over
the class of offences in question.  In the instant case, the District Court of
Ontario had jurisdiction over the offence with which the accused was charged,
and therefore the error of the trial judge would come under the third category
outlined by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Cloutier, supra.  The
error could be cured if the Court found there was no prejudice to the accused.

 

                   There is one
further aspect, however, that justifies annulling the trial, and the Court of
Appeal rightly distinguished its Cloutier decision, supra, on
this basis.  Section 686(1) (b)(iv) speaks of a ""trial
court"".  A trial court, for indictable offences, is defined at s. 471
of the Code (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ):

 

                   471.  Except where otherwise expressly
provided by law, every accused who is charged with an indictable offence shall
be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury.

 

This definition is repeated in
s. 536(2) of the Code, in the address to the accused for his
election.

 

                   As can be seen from
s. 471 of the Code, a jury is more than an incident or a procedural
tool in a trial case.  The jury is the court, together with the trial
judge.  If the jury is not constituted according to the rules, the court exists
no more than if the judge had been unlawfully appointed.  In the case at bar,
the problem is not one of application of the jury selection rules, which could
have been saved by s. 686(1)(b)(iv) of the Code.  The rules
were changed.  The jury was selected pursuant to other rules than those set out
in the Code.  There was therefore no trial court properly constituted,
and the appropriate sanction is annulment.

 

                   This holding does
not detract from the classification proposed in Cloutier, supra. 
In order for the saving provisions of s. 686(1)(b)(iv) of the Code
to find application, not only must the court have jurisdiction over the class
of offence, but it must also be a court within the meaning of the Code. 
Any failure with respect to these conditions constitutes an error falling in
the first category outlined in Cloutier, supra.

 

                   The trial was
therefore null.

 

III -- Section 10 (b) of the Charter 

 

                   This issue is
better left to the determination of the judge that will hear the new trial in
this case.  I nevertheless agree with Stevenson J. that the trial judge was in
a better position to rule on the admissibility of the statements, that the
Court of Appeal should not have interfered with his determination and that the
issue under his disposition of the appeal is moot as to the statement which was
admitted.

 

IV -- Answers

 

                   I would answer the
constitutional questions as follows:

 

1.Are
ss. 633 and 634 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  [formerly
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 562 and 563], inconsistent with ss. 7 , 11 (d)
or 15  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

A.Section
634(1) and (2) (formerly R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 563(1) and (2)) of the Criminal
Code  are not inconsistent with ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  The allegation of a violation of s. 15  of
the Charter  was abandoned.  Sections 633  and 634(3)  of the Criminal
Code  (formerly ss. 562  and 563(3) ) were not challenged.

 

2.If
the answer to question 1 is affirmative, are ss. 633  and/or 634 [formerly
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 562 and/or 563] justified by s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution
Act, 1982 ?

 

A.This
question does not arise.

 

V -- Conclusion

 

                   The trial judge
erred in restricting the number of peremptory challenges to four for each side
and in depriving the Crown of its right to stand by jurors.  I would
therefore dismiss the appeal and maintain the setting aside of the acquittal of
the appellant and the direction that a new trial be held.

 

//Stevenson J.//

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   Stevenson
J. -- This case concerns
the constitutional validity of the jury selection process contained in s. 563
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, (now R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ,
s. 634 ).  At issue is whether this process, which grants the Crown 48 stand bys
and four peremptory challenges while the accused's being allowed only four, 12
or 20 peremptory challenges, infringes the accused's right to be tried by an
independent and impartial jury as guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms .  Also in issue is the admissibility of certain of the
appellant's statements allegedly taken in violation of his right to counsel.

 

Facts

 

                   The appellant was
charged with sexual assault pursuant to s. 246.1 (now s. 271) of the Criminal
Code .  The charge arises from an incident which occurred in the early
morning hours of December 1, 1984.

 

                   The appellant was
arrested later that day.  Two police officers attended at his home where he
resided with his parents.  Upon arrest, the appellant was informed of his right
to counsel.  Immediately after this, his father, Mr. Bain, told him not to say
anything until he had seen a lawyer.  While his son got dressed in preparation
to accompany the police, Mr. Bain, with the help of one of the police officers,
attempted to retain a lawyer by looking through the Yellow Pages.  After being
unsuccessful with two or three numbers, the police officer gave him a business
card with his telephone number on it.  He told Mr. Bain that when a lawyer had
been retained, the lawyer should call the officer at the number on the card. 
The appellant then left with the officers.

 

                   After both officers
returned to the car, they drove off with the appellant and parked down the
street.  The police officers updated their notebooks and were discussing
between themselves what had occurred in the house.  According to one of the
officer's (McIntyre) testimony in chief, the appellant initiated an inculpatory
conversation.

 

                   During his
testimony on the voir dire, the appellant denied making some of these
statements; in particular, he denied making the inculpatory admissions.

 

                   Upon arrival at the
police station, the appellant was placed alone in an interview room.  About 25
minutes later, a lawyer who had been retained by Mr. Bain called for the police
officer.  McIntyre returned the telephone call 10 minutes later.  The lawyer
told McIntyre that he had been retained by the appellant's parents on behalf of
the appellant.  McIntyre informed the lawyer of the circumstances of the
investigation and of the alleged sexual assault and told the lawyer that the
appellant would probably be released later that day.  The lawyer could not
attend at the police station that day so he simply told McIntyre not to take
any statement from the appellant until he, the lawyer, was present.  On the
stand, the lawyer could not remember whether he had asked to speak to the
appellant.

 

                   Following this
telephone conversation, McIntyre (and another officer, Chisholm) went into the
interview room with the appellant.  According to the appellant's testimony, he
asked  whether his father had called. McIntyre told him that his father had not
called.  The appellant said that he wanted to contact his father to find out if
his father had retained a lawyer.  McIntyre told the appellant that he could
call his father later.  At no time did McIntyre tell the appellant about the
telephone call from the lawyer.  The police officers initiated an interrogation
of the appellant.

 

                   The appellant told
the officers that he was very impaired the previous night due to the intake of
a considerable amount of alcohol as well as one ""hit"" of L.S.D.  The
officers then questioned the appellant about his prior relationship with the
complainant.  He was also questioned about his interaction with the complainant
on the night in question.

 

                   On April 21, 1987,
the appellant was tried before a judge and jury in Brampton, Ontario, on a
charge of sexual assault.  Following arraignment, but before the first
prospective juror was asked to step forward, appellant's counsel sought a ruling
that both the Crown and the defence each be limited to four peremptory
challenges and that the Crown be denied the power to stand jurors by.  The
trial judge made the requested ruling based on his own holdings to the same
effect in other cases.  He considered himself bound by his own ruling
""until the Court of Appeal rules otherwise"".  The Crown's objection
was noted.  The jurors were then selected with both the defence and the Crown
exercising their four peremptory challenges.

 

                   Following a 14-day
trial, the jury acquitted the appellant.  On January 31, 1989, the Court of
Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal ((1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 250) and ordered a
new trial.  The appellant appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada as of right.

Judgments

 

Voir Dire -- District Court (Kent
Dist.Ct.J.)(1987), 30
C.R.R. 75

 

                   On the voir dire
held to determine the admissibility of the utterances made by appellant to the
police, the trial judge held that only those statements made before McIntyre's
conversation with appellant's lawyer were admissible.  The police officer knew
that counsel had been retained for the appellant as a result of his discussion
with the lawyer.  The trial judge found failure of the police to communicate to
the appellant the fact that counsel had been retained to be contrary to the
spirit of the judgment in R. v. Greig, [1987] 56 C.R. (3d) 229, per Dupont J. 
In his opinion, at p. 78:

 

                   The
police effectively foreclosed any opportunity that the accused had to consult
with counsel retained for him before his interview, by not advising the accused
that the lawyer retained for him by his family was on the telephone. Surely
that opportunity should not be determined by the retaining of counsel who knows
what specific question to ask an investigating officer. 

 

                   The fact that the
accused was a ""young offender"" facing an extremely serious criminal
charge was significant to the trial judge and constituted special
circumstances.  Further, the judge noted at p. 78:

 

Surely,
to suggest that no obligation arises on the part of the investigating officer
merely because the family-retained lawyer does not make a request in the
specific words that the officer is listening for does not change the picture.
Certainly it does not place too high an obligation on the police to pass on to
a young alleged offender facing a very serious charge the fact that his father
has made a lawyer available for him, as he promised when the accused was
removed from his home.

 

For those reasons, the judge held that
the appellant's right to counsel had been breached by the investigating
officer.  Before continuing, he noted that the oral utterances by the appellant
were made freely and voluntarily.

 

                   He then turned to
consider whether the statements should be excluded.  The trial judge concluded,
at p. 79, that ""a reasonable person, dispassionate and fully apprised of
the circumstances of this case"" would probably conclude that the admission
of the appellant's statements made after the officer was aware that counsel had
been retained for the appellant would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.  Accordingly, all the utterances made by the appellant after the
telephone call were held to be inadmissible.

 

Ontario Court of Appeal (Dubin A.C.J.O., Zuber and Finlayson
JJ.A.)(1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 250

 

                   Writing the
judgment of the Court, Finlayson J.A. first considered whether the trial judge
erred in ordering that both the Crown and the appellant were to have an equal
number of peremptory challenges with no power to the Crown to stand jurors
aside as permitted in the Criminal Code .  In his view, the trial judge
clearly erred.  Relying on R. v. Varga (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d)
281, and R. v. Stoddart (1987), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 351 (both decisions of
the Ontario Court of Appeal), he held that the jury selection procedure does
not infringe ss. 7 , 11 (d) or 15  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms .

 

                   Relying on R. v.
Rowbotham (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 1, Finlayson J.A. held that the failure to
follow the jury selection process in the Criminal Code  is fatal to the
jurisdiction of the trial court and could not be cured by invoking
s. 613(1) (b)(iv) (now s. 686(1) (b)(iv) of the Criminal
Code .  Finlayson J.A. held there must be a new trial on that basis alone.

 

                   He then considered
the admissibility of the appellant's utterances.  He did not think there would
be any helpful information given to the appellant had the officer relayed to
him the fact that his lawyer called since the lawyer did not ask to speak to
him or to pass on any message.  Relying on R. v. Logan (1988), 46 C.C.C.
(3d) 354, Finlayson J.A. concluded that the trial judge erred in his ruling on
the admissibility of the utterances.  He noted that there was to be a new trial
on the jury selection issue and that it is open for the trial judge to take a
different view of the evidence.  In Finlayson J.A.'s opinion, however, based on
Kent Dist. Ct. J.'s own findings of fact, Kent Dist. Ct. J. was in error. 
Finlayson J. A. noted at p. 257:

 

...
it is my view that he was in error in fixing the police officer with the
responsibility of doing more than answer literally the question put to him by
Bain.  He was not obliged to volunteer additional information.  Bain was
entitled under s. 10 (b) of the Charter  to be informed of his right to
retain and instruct counsel without delay.  That was done. In this case, on the
evidence, Detective McIntyre went further and assisted Bain's father in finding
a lawyer in the yellow pages of the telephone book.

 

                   The
detective knew that [counsel] had been retained but he also knew that the
solicitor did not propose to come to the police station and had not asked to
speak to his client over the telephone. He received no indication of when, if
ever, Mr. Munro was prepared to give legal advice to his client. Surely this is
not enough to bring the police investigation to a dead halt or even deflect
their attention from a proper questioning of the respondent ....

 

                   The appeal was allowed
and a new trial directed.

 

Constitutional Questions

 

                   The following
constitutional questions were stated on June 7, 1989:

 

1.Are
ss. 633 and 634 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , [formerly
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 562 and 563] inconsistent with ss. 7 , 11 (d) or
15  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If
the answer to question 1 is affirmative, are ss. 633 and/or 634 [formerly
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 562 and/or 563] justified by s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution
Act, 1982 ?

 

Issues

 

                   Although other
provisions and issues were discussed, this case is to be resolved by addressing
the following questions:

 

1.Is
s. 562 (now s. 634) of the Criminal Code  inconsistent with s. 11 (d)?

 

2.If
so, is it saved by s. 1 ?

 

3.Did
the trial judge err in excluding the statements made after the lawyer retained
by the father telephoned the police and the appellant inquired whether his
father had telephoned?

 

                   Also argued before
this Court and below, was whether s. 686(1) (b)(iv) (formerly s. 613(1)(b)(iv))
of the Criminal Code  could be applied to cure a loss of jurisdiction
resulting from the failure of the trial judge to observe s. 563 of the Code. 
As a result of my conclusion on the first issue, I need not address that
question.

 

Analysis

 

1.  Section 11(d) of the Charter

 

                   The independence
and impartiality of the tribunal by which an accused person is tried is a
central feature of our criminal law that has long been recognized.  The
importance of this right is illustrated by its entrenchment in s. 11 (d)
of the Charter .  The appellant argues that the system of selecting
jurors contained within the Criminal Code  impairs the  appearance of
impartiality and is therefore unconstitutional.  The appellant's argument is
directed at the disproportionate powers the Crown and the accused have to
remove potential jurors from the selection process.

 

                   The Criminal
Code  sets out the following  procedures.  Each party is allowed unlimited
challenges for cause and s. 567  (now s. 638 ) of the Criminal Code 
specifies the grounds upon which this can be done.  Additionally, each party is
allowed to exercise peremptory challenges.  A peremptory challenge allows a
party to dismiss a person from serving on the jury without providing a reason. 
The Crown is allotted four such challenges.  If charged with murder or high
treason, the accused is allowed 20 peremptory challenges.  For other offences
for which the accused may be sentenced to more than five years' imprisonment
the accused receives 12 peremptory challenges.  For all other offences, the
accused is allowed four peremptory challenges.

 

                   In addition to
these challenges, however, the Crown is allowed to stand by up to 48 potential
jurors under s. 563 (now s. 634).  Theoretically the stand by is different from
a peremptory challenge.  Rather than dismissing the potential juror using a
peremptory challenge or challenging for cause, the person is asked to stand
by.  The following description of the nature of the stand by from Morin v.
The Queen (1890), 18 S.C.R. 407, is apt.  Chief Justice Ritchie explained
at p. 421:

 

...
after giving the crown in all criminal trials four peremptory challenges it
[the legislation] declares that this shall not be construed to affect the right
of the crown to cause any juror to stand aside until the panel has been gone
through or to challenge any number of jurors for cause.... the panel shall be
gone through, or perused as it is termed, once on which calling or perusal it
was the privilege of the crown to require jurors to stand aside until the list
shall be gone through.  Having been gone through and a jury not secured the
clerk proceeds to go over the panel a second time when the right of the crown
to require jurors to stand aside ceased, and the crown was bound, if its
officers sought to perfect its challenge, to do so by showing some good and
sufficient cause or to challenge peremptorily if the peremptory challenges were
not exhausted.

 

                   The accused does
not have this right to stand by jurors.  It is this asymmetry that the
appellant alleges which produces the appearance of partiality sufficient to
amount to an infringement of the Charter .

 

The Appropriate Test

 

                   As a starting
point, s. 11 (d) of the Charter  requires that an accused person
receive a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal.  The test for
that requirement was set out by Justice Le Dain in Valente v. The Queen,
[1985] 2 S.C.R. 673, which has most recently been approved by this Court in R.
v. Lippé, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 114.  Although those cases focused on
judicial independence, the test applies to impartiality as well.  Le Dain J.
framed the test as follows, at p. 689:

 

...
I think, that the test for independence for purposes of s. 11 (d) of
the Charter  should be, as for impartiality, whether the tribunal may be
reasonably perceived as independent.  Both independence and impartiality are
fundamental not only to the capacity to do justice in a particular case but
also to individual and public confidence in the administration of justice. 
Without that confidence the system cannot command the respect and acceptance
that are essential to its ineffective operation.  It is, therefore, important
that a tribunal should be perceived as independent, as well as impartial, and
that the test for independence should include that perception.

 

                   It is clear from
this passage that it is not necessary to find that juries are actually partial
before an infringement of the Charter  is found.  The informed observer's
perception that the system of selecting jurors impairs impartiality is
sufficient.  If one party enjoys a greater influence, the observer need only
have a reasonable apprehension of partiality.  This accords with Le Dain J.'s
reference to de Grandpré J.'s comments from Committee for Justice and
Liberty v. National Energy Board, [1978] 1 S.C.R 369.  At page 684 of Valente,
supra, Le Dain J.  reproduced de Grandpré J.'s comments at p. 394:

 

...
the apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right
minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the
required information.   In the words of the Court of Appeal, that test is
""what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and
practically -- and having thought the matter through -- conclude....""

 

Application of the Test

 

                   In my view, the
disparity between the accused's and the Crown's right to challenge jurors
cannot meet the test from Valente.  Briefly the stand by cannot be
upheld because the Crown is allowed to have a greater role in fashioning the
jury.  It may take partisan interests into consideration in carrying out that
role.  The accused's role in selecting his or her jury of peers is thereby
significantly diminished, impairing the appearance that the jury is indifferent
as between the Crown and the accused.  This offends the Charter  because
the appearance of impartiality is an essential element of the right guaranteed
by s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

                   I base my
conclusions on the ground that the substantial disparity contained in this
legislation  exists not in a mere procedure or rule but in the role each party
has in choosing the jury by which the accused will be tried.

 

Numerical Inequality

 

                   I turn first to the
extensive discrepancy between the number of challenges afforded to the Crown
and the accused.  I emphasize that it is not merely the inequality of the
position of the Crown and the accused that leads to an inference of the
appearance of partiality.  The Crown and the accused are never in a parallel
position during the course of a trial.  Indeed, there are many procedures,
rules, and practices contained within the Code and the common law that
detract from any symmetry between the Crown and the accused.  There is
necessarily a difference in the status and power of the Crown and the accused
given the nature of their respective roles in a trial.  I do not intend to cast
doubt on that reality, but in this case, the substantial difference in the
fundamental activity of choosing the jury demands explanation and
justification.

 

                   I proceed upon the
basis that the power to stand by jurors in many instances amounts to granting
the Crown additional peremptory challenges.  The appellant argued that the
stand by was in fact tantamount to a peremptory challenge.  Once a juror is
stood by, that person will not be called again to sit on that jury unless the
whole panel has been exhausted.  In both written and oral argument the Crown
made the important concession that in some cases the stand by does amount to a
peremptory challenge.  Once it is recognized that the stand by can and does in
fact operate as a peremptory challenge, there can be no obvious justification
for granting 52 peremptory challenges (in the form of stand bys and statutorily
granted peremptory challenges) to the Crown where the accused only enjoys four,
12 or 20.

 

                   I recognize that in
the case of multiple defendants, each accused is entitled to the same number of
challenges as if the accused were being tried separately, whereas the Crown is
limited to the amount specified in the Code.  For instance, on a charge
for murder where there are three defendants, the accused persons would have a
total of 60 peremptory challenges whereas the Crown would be limited to a total
of four peremptory and 48 stand bys.  Similarly, if there are five or more
co-defendants for any other offence which carries the possibility of more than
five years' imprisonment, the Crown's number of peremptory challenges and stand
bys would be equal or less than the total defence peremptory challenges.  For
offences not carrying more than five years liability of imprisonment, however,
there would have to be 13 or more co-defendants before the Crown would have the
equivalent or less combined stand by and peremptory challenges than the total
of the accused persons' peremptory challenges.

 

                   The spectre of multiple
defendants cannot justify conferring upon the Crown such a substantial
advantage in the number of challenges.  In most situations, the Crown enjoys
far more peremptory challenges in the form of stand bys than the accused.  The
Crown does not have as strong a claim to the concept of challenge without cause
as does the accused and there is no inherent reason why the Crown would need
more (or perhaps even as many) challenges as the accused.  In any event, I do
not think the relative infrequency of the scenarios listed above can serve to
justify the more common occurrence of the Crown's possessing a broad numerical
advantage.

 

The Stand By and the Peremptory
Challenge

 

                   The Crown argued
that the stand bys are necessary because they have a purpose beyond their
utility as a peremptory challenge.  In my opinion, a brief review of the
historical origins of the stand by illustrates its basis is suspect and there
is little modern justification for its continued existence.

 

                   The English common
law originally granted the Crown an unlimited capacity peremptorily to
challenge jurors while the accused was only allowed 35 peremptory challenges. 
This unlimited power led to abuses because the Crown would peremptorily
challenge the whole array of jurors without qualifying 12 jurors.  The trial
was then postponed and the accused kept in custody until the next session.  An
attempt was made to curtail this abuse in 1305 when a statute containing the
following edict was passed (An Ordinance for Inquests, 33 Ed. 1,
c. 4):

 

...
but if they that sue for the King will challenge any of those Jurors, they
shall assign of their Challenge a Cause certain, and the Truth of the same
Challenge shall be enquired of according to the Custom of the Court; ...

 

                   Despite the fact
that the logical reading of this provision seems to indicate that the Crown had
no power to challenge except for cause, it was interpreted to mean that the
Crown need not assign the cause for its challenge until the panel had been gone
through.  Presumably the Courts felt they could not sanction eliminating the
Crown's power to challenge absent cause while accused persons retained that
ability.  It was thus that the stand by was born.  Certain attempts were made
to impugn this rule but it survived and was re-enacted in The Juries Act,
1825 (Eng.), 6 Geo. 4, c. 50, s. 29, which was interpreted in the same
manner as its predecessor.

 

                   Canada inherited
this legacy.  Section 668(9)  of The Criminal Code , 1892, S.C. 1892,
c. 29, granted the Crown an unlimited power to stand by jurors.  This was
eventually reduced to 48, as now exists, in 1917 (An Act to amend the
Criminal Code (respecting jurors), S.C. 1917, c. 13, s. 1).  When
this legislation was being debated, the Minister of Justice, Hon. C. J. Doherty
noted that:

 

                   Perhaps
it might be more correct to say that the more you increase the number of men
from whom the Crown can, by this process of elimination, select the twelve that
it wants, the more you increase the opportunity for the Crown to find a jury
exactly to its liking.

 

[House
of Commons Debates, Aug. 9, 1917, at p. 4309.]

 

The twentieth century justification of
the stand by was discussed by Hart J.A. in R. v. Johnstone (1986), 26
C.C.C (3d) 401 (N.S.S.C.A.D.), as follows at p. 412:

 

                   The
traditional reason for permitting the Crown to stand aside jurors as they were
called to the book to be sworn was the limited size of a jury panel.  If both
the Crown and the accused had the number of peremptory challenges available to
the accused the panel would soon become exhausted and the need for talesmen
would arise.  To prevent this problem the Crown was permitted to stand aside
the juror rather than challenge him at that time, and this would permit the
juror to remain on the panel until all of the members have been exhausted and
then be recalled if a full jury had not been sworn.  Those jurors who had been
stood aside would then still be available to complete the jury without the need
of talesmen: ...

 

See also  McEldowney, ""`Stand By
For The Crown':  an Historical Analysis"", [1979] Crim. L.R. 272,
Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, Lewis ed., vol. 4,
pp. 354-56 and pp. 1739-42 (Lewis' edition), Morin v. The Queen,
supra, and R. v. Cecchini (1985), 22 C.C.C. (3d) 323 (Ont.
H.C.).  This modern rationale does not justify numerical disparity, nor permit
only one of the adversaries to defer its challenge.

 

                   I turn now to
determine the rationale for peremptory challenges, in order to ascertain the
justification for any disparity between the powers of the crown and the accused.

 

                   What, then is the
basis for the peremptory challenge?  I can find no basis other than that
expressed by Blackstone, supra, at p. 353 and p. 1738 (of Lewis'
edition):

 

...
in criminal cases, or at least in capital ones, there is, in favorem vitae,
allowed to the prisoner an arbitrary and capricious species of challenge to a
certain number of jurors, without showing any cause at all, which is called a peremptory
challenge; a provision full of that tenderness and humanity to prisoners for
which our English laws are justly famous.  This is grounded on two reasons.  i.  As every one must be sensible what
sudden impressions and unaccountable prejudices we are apt to conceive upon the
bare looks and gestures of another, and how necessary it is that a prisoner
(when put to defend his life), should have a good opinion of his jury, the want
of which might totally disconcert him, the law wills not that he should be
tried by any one man against whom he has conceived a prejudice, even without
being able to assign a reason for such his dislike.  2.  Because, upon challenges for cause shown, if the reasons
assigned prove insufficient to set aside the juror, perhaps the bare
questioning his indifference may sometimes provoke a resentment, to prevent all
ill consequences from which the prisoner is still at liberty, if he pleases,
peremptorily to set him aside.

 

                   This passage was
quoted in Cloutier v. The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 709, at p. 720. 
The basis of the peremptory challenge is ""purely subjective.""  In R.
v. Mason, [1981] Q.B. 881 (C.A.), the history of stand bys was considered. 
At pages 889-90 Lawton L.J. refers to a quotation from Lord Campbell C.J.
that a stand by is the equivalent of a peremptory challenge which could be
exercised until the whole panel had been called.  This right may be exercised
without valid provable objection.  At page 888, the court gives as an
example of the use of the stand by an instance where a poacher might properly
be stood by where the charge involves wounding a gamekeeper while poaching. 
The court noted that this juror is unlikely to be impartial.  So it is clear
that ""partiality"" may be considered in exercising the power.

 

                   As no objective
showing need be made, it is clear that either side may exercise the right to
exclude a juror on considerations of partiality.

 

                   The Crown, in
exercising its stand by power, is hoping to achieve a peremptory challenge,
deferring its challenge for cause, or deferring its peremptory challenge.  In
any case it is given greater play in the selection of the jury, in its
fashioning, than is permitted to the accused.

 

                   In argument,
counsel for the Crown contended that the stand by is a ""deferred challenge
for cause"" and therefore should not be viewed in the same vein as
peremptory challenges.  I am unable to accept that characterization in the
light of the acknowledgment that the stand by may be employed as a peremptory
challenge and given the reality of large jury panels that ensures that in a
great many cases a juror stood by will not be recalled.  Informed commentators
have no difficulty in concluding that the ""stand by"" gives
substantial rights of challenge:  East, ""Jury Packing:  A Thing of the
Past?"" (1985), 48 Mod. L.R. 518, at p. 520.  McEldowney, supra,
says it ""... is analogous to the defence's right of peremptory challenge
...,"" at p. 272, quoting the Morris Report, Cmnd 2627 (1965).  That
the challenge and stand by may both be used for partisan reasons was the
conclusion of the Roskill Committee, Fraud Trials, 1986, paragraphs 7.36 ff.
which condemned manipulation and recommended abolition of both the peremptory
challenge and the stand by.  Consequently the peremptory challenge has been
eliminated and the stand by substantially circumscribed in England:  Halsbury's
Laws of England, Annual Abridgment, 1988, paragraph 1313.

 

                   Even if the
""stand by"" is recalled the Crown may still exercise a peremptory
challenge to exclude that person.  In this sense, the stand by is not
necessarily a deferred challenge for cause.  That description was appropriate at
one time but the present section (s. 641, formerly s. 570) of the Criminal
Code  states that if no names remain to be called and a full jury is not
sworn, the names of those stood by are called again and ""they shall be
sworn, unless challenged by the accused, or unless the prosecutor challenges
them or shows cause why they should not be sworn"".  It is clear,
therefore, that a juror stood by can still be peremptorily challenged by the
Crown or the accused.

 

                   The Crown also
claims it acts in its quasi-judicial role and uses the stand by to exclude
those people who are inappropriate but whose objectionability neither fits
within the boundaries of s. 567 (now s. 638) nor is egregious enough to warrant
the utilization of a peremptory challenge.  It also argued that the modern
justification for its power to challenge is to provide a balanced selection of
jurors.  The Crown claimed it uses the challenges only within its
quasi-judicial role:  it seeks only to secure an impartial jury and not one
predisposed towards the Crown's case.

 

                   In the absence of
some control, however, the observer of the process is bound to conclude that
the crown possesses a substantial advantage and by its uncontrolled exercise
may influence the make-up of that jury under partisan considerations.

 

                   I agree with
Professor Mewett's observation in ""The Jury Stand-By"" (1988), 30 Crim.
L.Q. 385, at p. 386, ""But the dividing line between the Crown's
legitimate interest in ensuring an impartial jury and any illegitimate interest
it may have in packing the jury, if not with favourable jurors then at least
with not unfavourable jurors, is not an easy one to draw and even less easy to
enforce"".  In Cloutier, supra, at pp. 720-21, this Court
noted that peremptory challenges were intended to give each party the right to
remove individuals ""whom he does not believe to be impartial"".  To a
similar effect is the observation, quoted above, of the Minister of Justice in
1917.

 

                   While I agree that
the stand by may be used beneficially, I do not think we can rely on professed
good intentions to uphold such a disparity. An example of the use of the power
to tailor the jury selection is found in the recent case of R. v. Pizzacalla
(1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 783. The Crown acts within an adversarial forum.  It is not
unreasonable to think that there are times when the Crown's challenges or stand
bys are motivated by an anxiety to secure a conviction rather than a strictly
quasi-judicial interest in the fairness of the trial.  It is, indeed, proper
for the Crown to use the process to put aside potential jurors who may be
partial to the accused. In the context of the jury trial ""impartial""
means ""indifferent"" and the peremptory powers enable the parties a
limited power to exercise subjective assessments of that indifference.  What
cannot be justified to the observer of the process is granting the Crown a
greater opportunity to carry these assessments into the selection process.

 

                    Would an informed
observer perceive an unfairness in the jury selection process that may affect
the indifference, real or perceived, of the jury?  If the Crown exercises a
quasi-judicial function to stand by jurors its motivation and reasons are
unknown.  Keeping in mind the fact that the juror stood by is not often
recalled, there is an inherent perception that the jury selection process is
unbalanced.  Regardless of the Crown's motives and reasons for standing by a
juror, there remains a clear impression of inequality caused by the marked
imbalance between the Crown's and the accused's ability to configure the jury. 
While the Crown may perform a quasi-judicial function it is not uninterested in
securing convictions of accused persons.  Section 563 (now s. 634) is
unconstitutional because it provides for the apparent transformation of this
interest into reality.  This offends s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

                   As the Crown noted
in this case, the constitutional validity of s. 563 (now s. 634) has been
examined by many courts before.  In many of these cases, the courts recognized
the inherent unfairness in the difference between the Crown's and the accused's
ability to challenge jurors and yet upheld the section.  O'Leary J.'s comments
in R. v. Piraino (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 28 (Ont. H.C.), are typical.  At
pages 30-31 he stated:

 

                   There
is no doubt that the right given the Crown to challenge four jurors
peremptorily and to stand aside 48, while the accused on a rape charge can
challenge but 12 jurors peremptorily and the requirement that the accused
declare first whether he challenges a juror, gives the Crown an unfair
advantage in the jury selection process.  This does not mean, however, that
there is any danger that the jury chosen will not be independent and
impartial.  It simply means that the Crown has a much better chance than the
defence of selecting out of the entire jury panel a jury it hopes will be most
sympathetic to its position.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   In R. v.
Johnstone, supra, Hart J.A. also discussed the validity of
s. 563 (now s. 634).  At pages 412-13 he noted:

 

                   In
recent years jury panels have become much larger and there is less need for the
Crown to exercise its right to stand individual jurors aside, but
unfortunately a practice has arisen with certain Crown counsel to stand aside
large numbers of jurors, and it may be that the time has come to eliminate this
process and balance the number of peremptory challenges available to both the
Crown and the accused.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Similarly DuPont J. in R. v.
Cecchini, supra, noted at p. 326:

 

... the
disparity in the rights or challenges as between the Crown and the accused in
most cases prevents that vital part of a criminal trial from appearing fair. 
This results from the use made by Crowns of their rights to stand aside, which
in many cases gives them, in the eyes of the public, a major advantage.  It can
be argued that a jury selected with a marked advantage to one side in its
selection will not meet the test of appearing to be impartial.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

                   In Cecchini,
where the accused was charged with murder, DuPont J. limited the Crown's stand
bys to 16.  See also R. v. Favel (1987), 39 C.C.C. (3d) 378 (Sask.
C.A.), R. v. Stoddart (1987), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 351 (Ont. C.A.), and R.
v. Ross (1986), 53 C.R. (3d) 81 (Ont. H.C.).

 

                   In all of these
cases (except Cecchini) the courts, if asked, have upheld the
constitutional validity of s. 563 (now s. 634).  In most of those cases, the
following reasoning from Piraino was either explicitly or implicitly
applied.  In his oral judgment, O'Leary J. stated at pp. 29-30:

 

                   The
jury selection process is just one step in the trial. The course of a trial is
governed and affected by almost countless rules relating to procedure and the
admissibility of evidence. Many of those rules when isolated and looked at
individually, would appear to favour either the Crown or the accused. Indeed,
the same rule may at one point favour the Crown and at another point favour the
accused. Others of those rules consistently favour either the Crown or the
accused. The requirements; that the Crown prove each element of a charge beyond
a reasonable doubt before there can be a conviction; that the accused cannot be
required to testify and that the Crown and the trial judge may not comment on
the fact that the accused has not testified are examples of rules that favour
the accused.

 

                   In
my view, so far as the issue before me is concerned, the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  gives to every citizen the right to a fair trial. It
does not assure him the right that every rule that governs that trial, when
examined individually, be fair to him. It does, however, assure him that any
individual rule that is so unfair that it will result in an unfair trial being
had will be struck down.

 

Potts J.'s comments in R. v. Ross,
supra, reveal a similar viewpoint at p. 86:

 

                   When
one reviews the entire jury selection process, it becomes clear that the acts
complained of as being unfair are at the end of a rather lengthy process
designed to ensure randomness and independence and impartiality.  Can the
Crown's ability to request that a potential juror stand aside be seen to impugn
this entire process?  I respectfully submit that it cannot. At best, the jury
selection carried on in a courtroom by counsel is educated guesswork operating
on a sample of strangers carefully chosen in a neutral fashion.  Does an
individual, chosen at random, who has survived the scrutiny of the accused assume
a pro-Crown bias merely because he is not asked by the Crown to stand aside? 
Does a jury composed of such individuals become something less than
""independent and impartial""?  Alternatively, does an individual who
is initially asked to stand aside but later recalled assume a pro-accused bias
merely because he had first been asked to stand aside?  I would respectfully
submit that the individual biases of any potential juror are left unaffected by
the Crown's request to stand aside or not. 

 

                   With respect this
reasoning fails to recognize that the relative roles of the accused and the
Crown in selecting the jury are not comparable to other procedures within the
trial process.  The jury must be, and must be seen to be, impartial.  When the
Crown enjoys a tactical advantage, as occurs because of the stand asides, the
accused's role in selecting his or her jury is diminished.

 

                   The peremptory
challenge is not, itself, under attack.  It may be used under partisan
considerations, and so long as the right of exercise is proportionate neither
the crown nor the accused can be said to have an unconstitutional advantage.

 

                   I now turn to what
I take to be the main theses of the Crown's position.

 

                   Firstly the jury
should be, and should be seen as, impartial, representative and competent. 
While Canadian law has not adopted a theory of representativeness, I accept
that proposition.  Then it is acknowledged that both parties are granted a
limited opportunity to affect jury selection, having regard to these
characteristics. It is acknowledged that the crown is given a greater
opportunity to affect the selection.

 

                   This asymmetry is
justified on the basis that the Crown has a greater interest than the accused. 
I fail to see why the accused does not have the same interest in these factors
that the Crown possesses. I see no inherent justification for giving the
litigants different roles in selecting their jury.

 

                   Much is made of the
quasi-judicial role of the prosecutor. Jury picking would be contrary to this
duty.  But unlike the case in Lippé there are no effective safeguards in
place to ensure that the decisions are all made only in the interest of the
fair trial rather than in securing a conviction. The Crown does not need to
disclose its reasons for standing by or exercising peremptory challenges.

 

                   It suggests that it
has no adversary interest in jury selection process. I cannot accept that
proposition as commending itself to anyone observing the trial process.

 

                   The apprehension of
bias lies in the fact that the Crown has had a greater opportunity to choose
jurors to its liking, free to do so under partisan considerations.  We are not
here concerned about any mere trial rule, but rather the rules governing the
selection of the tribunal.  The existence of the jurors' oath here is no
greater protection than it is in the case of a disqualified member of an
administrative tribunal.

 

                   This perception
will arise in the majority of jury cases if equality is not applied from the
beginning.  Given the absence of any need to justify its powers, the Crown
cannot be shown as having taken a partisan advantage on any case by case basis.

 

                   That every accused
receive a fair trial in front of an impartial and independent jury is an
essential element of the fairness of the trial which s. 11 (d) of
the Charter  guarantees.  In R. v. Barrow, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 694,
Chief Justice Dickson, commented on the accused's right to be present during
all stages of his or her jury trial.  He stated at p. 710:

 

                   The
selection of an impartial jury is crucial to a fair trial.  The Criminal
Code  recognizes the importance of the selection process and sets out a
detailed procedure to be followed ....  Both the Crown and the accused
participate in the process, with the right to challenge for cause or
peremptorily and, in the case of the Crown, to stand aside potential jurors
....  The challenge for cause involves trial of the impartiality of potential
jurors, with examination by either side.  The accused, the Crown, and the
public at large all have the right to be sure that the jury is impartial and
the trial fair; on this depends public confidence in the administration of
justice.  Because of the fundamental importance of the selection of the jury
and because the Code gives the accused the right to participate in the
process, the jury selection should be considered part of the trial for the
purposes of s. 577(1)  [now s. 650 ].

 

Later, he noted at pp. 714-15:

 

...
the most important aspect of the case, namely, the appearance of justice.  Even
if the two-stage analysis of the empanelling process is a legally accurate
description of the interplay of the Criminal Code  and the Nova Scotia Juries
Act, it leaves out of account the effect of the proceedings in this case as
they would appear to the average citizen: ... 

 

                   What
of the public perception?  This is a case where the public perception of the
fairness of the proceedings is crucial.

 

                   The reasoning
revealed in Piraino and Ross that has found s. 563 (now s. 634)
valid was partially premised on the need of proof of real or actual partiality
of juries.  With respect, that rationale is erroneous.  What s. 11(d) of
the Charter  requires is that there be, at minimum, a reasonable
apprehension that juries generated by the selection process are impartial. 
Allowing the accused to have a manifest role in that process confirms that the
appearance of fairness and impartiality is maintained.  But when the Criminal
Code  allows the Crown to have such substantial advantage in the ability to
shape and fashion the jury, that perception is severely impaired.   This
violates the test for 11(d).

 

2.  Section 1  of the Charter 

 

                   Only one party, the
intervener the Attorney General of Canada, presented any argument on s. 1 .  Its
submission on this point relied on the arguments it presented on the s. 11 (d)
violation issue.  The Crown (Ontario) sought a declaration that s. 563 (now
s. 634) does not violate s. 11 (d) of the Charter  or, in
the alternative, that it is justified by s. 1  of the Charter .  No written
or oral argument, however, was presented on this point.

 

                   In my view, the
violation in this case would be difficult to justify given the nature and scope
of that violation, but I need not answer that question.  It is a trite
statement of the law to say that the Crown has the burden of establishing that
a breach of the Charter  is demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society.  Neither the respondent nor the intervener identified any
pressing concern which would justify a limitation.  The burden remains
unsatisfied.  Therefore I find the infringement of s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
by s. 563  (now s. 634 ) is not a reasonable limit.

 

                   I want to emphasize
that I do not intend this finding to be an indication of whether or how a
violation of the accused's right to be tried in front of an impartial and
independent tribunal could be justified under s. 1  of the Charter .  That
question is left for another day.

 

3.  Admissibility of the
Statements

 

                   The third issue is
whether the certain statements allegedly made by the appellant to the
investigating officers are admissible.  At trial, Kent Dist. Ct. J. excluded
any statement made by the appellant after the lawyer retained by his father
spoke to McIntyre on the telephone.  Any statements made before that time were
admitted.  Because of its view on other issues, the Court of Appeal held that a
new trial was necessary.  It also stated it was open to the new trial judge to
take a different view of the evidence but in its opinion the trial judge, based
on his findings, was in error in excluding the statements taken after the
lawyer called the police station.

 

                   In the Court of
Appeal, the appellant apparently argued that the trial judge's ruling was
correct because once the lawyer had been retained any questioning should have
ceased.  At this Court, however, the appellant took a different view of this
issue.  He now argues that his right to retain and instruct counsel was
violated at the point of arrest.  In his submission, the police violated his s.
10 (b) rights once they required him to leave his home before a lawyer
had been contacted and therefore all the statements are inadmissible.

 

                   In my view, the
trial judge was correct about the exclusion of the statements.  I am mindful
that once an accused is informed of his or her right to counsel (as was found
to be the case in this appeal) the accused has the onus of showing he was
denied the opportunity to contact counsel.  As this Court held in R. v. Baig,
[1987] 2 S.C.R. 537, at p. 540:

 

We
agree with Tarnopolsky J.A. in R. v. Anderson (1984), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 417
(Ont. C.A.), wherein he said, at p. 431:

 

...
I am of the view that, absent proof of circumstances indicating that the
accused did not understand his right to retain counsel when he was informed of
it, the onus has to be on him to prove that he asked for the right but it was
denied or he was denied any opportunity to even ask for it.  No such evidence
was put forth in this case.

 

                   In the present case,
the accused did not put forward, nor does the record reveal, any evidence
suggesting that he was denied an opportunity to ask for counsel before the
inquiry at the police station.  Absent such circumstances, as that referred to
by Tarnopolsky J.A., once the police have complied with s. 10 (b),
by advising the accused without delay of his right to counsel, there are no
correlative duties triggered and cast upon them until the accused, if he so
chooses, has indicated his desire to exercise his right to counsel.

 

                   The trial judge
referred, at p. 78, to the ""peculiar and special circumstances of
this case ....""  The Court of Appeal found error in fixing the police with
the responsibility of doing more than answering literally the appellant's
question whether his father had called.  That question had to be addressed in
the context of the evidence.  Given the circumstances, a literal response was
misleading, because the obvious intent of that inquiry was to further the
objective of communicating with counsel.  It was tantamount to an assertion by
the appellant that he wanted counsel, and in those circumstances, the  answer
was an evasion which the officers used to continue the questioning in the face
of that assertion.  The trial judge had the advantage of assessing that inquiry
and response in the particular circumstances and did not err in law in
excluding the subsequent statements. On the assumption that first statement was
properly admitted, (an interesting, but as I am about to show, hypothetical,
question),  and the right to counsel waived for that purpose, then the trial
court correctly found re-assertion of any rights that had been given up in the
course of giving the first statement.

 

                   The appellant did
urge that his right to retain and instruct counsel was denied at the point of
arrest because police officers directed him to leave before a lawyer was
contacted.  I do not pass upon this argument because the accused was acquitted
notwithstanding the admission of the statement.  The ruling, so far as he is concerned,
is now academic, indeed moot.

 

Remedy

 

                   For reasons
discussed above, I find the portion of s. 563(1) (now s. 634(1)) and all
of s. 563(2) (now s. 634(2)) which combined grant the Crown 48 stand bys
to infringe s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  The Crown's power to
peremptorily challenge jurors is preserved.  Since none of the parties
presented arguments on the validity of s. 563(3)  (now s. 634(3) ), I
refrain from commenting on the constitutionality of that section.

 

                   Basically the
impugned provisions offend the Charter  because they impair the fairness
of the trial by producing, to an informed observer, a reasonable apprehension
of partiality.

 

Disposition

 

                   The portion of s.
563(1) (now s. 634(1)) and all of s. 563(2) (now s. 634(2)) of the Criminal
Code  which confer upon the Crown 48 stand bys is inoperative and of no
force because it offends s. 11 (d) of the Charter  and is not a
reasonable limit demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.  In
addition, the trial judge was correct in his ruling on the admissibility of the
appellant's statements.   The appeal is therefore allowed, the Court of
Appeal's direction for a new trial is set aside and the appellant's acquittal
restored.

 

                   I would permit
Parliament six months in which to provide new legislation, otherwise the Code
provisions will be invalidated to the extent that they permit the impugned
inequality. This decision would, however, apply to any case in which the
provision had been challenged and proceedings relating thereto are still on
foot.

 

                   The constitutional
questions are answered as follows:

 

1.Are
ss. 633 and 634 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46

with ss. 7 , 11 (d) or 15  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms ?

 

A.  Sections
634(1) and (2) (formerly R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, ss. 563(1) and
(2)) are inconsistent with s. 11 (d) in so far as they provides the crown
with a combination of peremptory challenges and stand bys in excess of the
number of peremptory challenges permitted to an accused.  It is unnecessary to
consider whether this provision violates s. 7 .  The allegation of a violation
of s. 15  was withdrawn.  Sections 633  and 634(3)  (formerly ss. 562 and
563(3)) were not challenged.

 

2.If
the answer to question 1 is affirmative, are ss. 633 and/or 634 [formerly
R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, ss. 562 and/or 563] justified by s. 1  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not
inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

A.
The violation is not justified under s. 1 .

 

                   Appeal allowed, Gonthier,
McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ. dissenting;
s. 563(1) and (2) (now s. 634(1) and (2)) were inconsistent with
s. 11(d) of the Charter and this violation was not justified under
s. 1 .

on appeal from the prince edward
island supreme court, appeal division

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Extraordinary remedies ‑‑ Certiorari ‑‑ Availability ‑‑ 
Provincial Court Judge dismissing accused's application, brought prior to
election, to quash information on grounds of insufficiency ‑‑
Whether certiorari available to review Provincial Court Judge's decision.

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Information ‑‑ Validity ‑‑ Provincial Court Judge
dismissing accused's application, brought prior to election, to quash
information on grounds of insufficiency ‑‑ Whether information an
absolute nullity ‑‑ Whether certiorari available to review
Provincial Court Judge's decision.

 

                   The accused was
charged with several sexual offences.  Prior to election, he applied to the
Provincial Court for an order quashing the information on the basis, among
others, that it failed to specify the place or the time of the offences so as
to satisfy the sufficiency requirements of s. 581(3)  of the Criminal
Code .  The Provincial Court Judge concluded that while ""some measure
of insufficiency exist[ed] in each of the charges, . . . it [was] not
of such a degree as would vitiate the charges"" and dismissed the
application.  The Prince Edward Island Supreme Court, Trial Division, dismissed
the accused's application for certiorari to quash the Provincial Court
Judge's decision and the Appeal Division upheld the judgment.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
dismissed.

 

                   A provincial court
judge conducting a preliminary hearing has jurisdiction to determine the
validity of the information and the correctness of his ruling in that regard
cannot generally be challenged by certiorari.  Here, the information was
not an absolute nullity ‑‑ it was not so badly drawn up as to fail
to give the accused fair notice of the charge ‑‑ and in deciding
whether or not to quash, the Provincial Court Judge was exercising jurisdiction
he undoubtedly had under s. 601  of the Criminal Code .  This case
thus falls within the general rule and certiorari was not available to
review the Provincial Court Judge's decision.  Certiorari, however,
could be available in certain rare and highly exceptional circumstances.

//Lamer C.J.//

 

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

 

                   Lamer C.J. ‑‑ The issue in this
appeal is a narrow one.  The accused moved before a Provincial Court Judge to
quash an information on the basis that it did not contain sufficient detail to
give him reasonable information with respect to the act or acts alleged against
him.  The Provincial Court Judge dismissed the application to quash, and the
accused sought certiorari to set aside that ruling.  The issue is
whether the Prince Edward Island courts were correct in holding that certiorari
is not available in these circumstances.

 

The Facts

 

                   The appellant was
charged in an information with twelve offences contrary to s. 156 or
s. 157 (since repealed) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.  1970, c.
C-34, specifically indecent assault, buggery and gross indecency.  Each offence
was alleged to have been committed over a period of time, ranging from
approximately one year to roughly nine years.   All twelve counts were alleged
to have been committed ""at or near Charlottetown and at or near Sherwood,
County of Queen's, in the Province of Prince Edward Island and at other places
in the Province of Prince Edward Island"".  No more specific location was
alleged for any of the twelve counts.

 

                   Prior to election,
the appellant applied to the Provincial Court for an order quashing the
information on the basis, among others, that it failed to specify the place of
the offence or the time of the offence so as to satisfy the sufficiency
requirements of s. 581(3)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985,
c. C-46 .  That subsection provides:

 

                   581. ...

 

                   (3) 
A count shall contain sufficient detail of the circumstances of the alleged
offence to give to the accused reasonable information with respect to the act
or omission to be proved against him and to identify the transaction referred
to, but otherwise the absence or insufficiency of details does not vitiate the
count.

 

                   The Provincial
Court Judge dismissed the application to quash, and the Supreme Court of Prince
Edward Island, Trial Division, dismissed an application for an order in the
nature of certiorari to quash the information  which decision was upheld
on appeal to the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, Appeal Division.

 

Judgments Below

 

Provincial Court (Chief Judge Fitzgerald)

 

                   The appellant
submitted that the information did not comply with the sufficiency requirements
of s. 581(3)  of the Criminal Code .  The Provincial Court Judge
determined that he had the requisite jurisdiction to hear a motion to quash the
information.  He went on to find the following:

 

                   On
the issue of sufficiency, in all of the various aspects of it relevant to the
charges before the court, I am of the view that some measure of insufficiency
exists in each of the charges, but it is not of such a degree as would vitiate
the charges.

 

Consequently, he dismissed the
application.

 

Supreme Court of P.E.I. (Campbell J.)

 

                   The appellant
applied to the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, Trial Division, for an
order in the nature of certiorari quashing the decision of the
Provincial Court Judge.

 

                   In brief oral
reasons, Campbell J., dismissed the appellant's application, based on the
authority of Re Bahinipaty and The Queen (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 439
(Sask. C.A.).

 

Court of Appeal (Carruthers C.J. for the Court)

 

                   Carruthers C.J.
concluded that a Provincial Court Judge has jurisdiction prior to election on a
preliminary inquiry to determine the validity of the counts in an information
and certiorari does not lie to quash the decision of the Provincial
Court Judge.

 

                   In so concluding,
Carruthers C.J. applied the case of R. v. Burke (1988), 71 Nfld. &
P.E.I.R. 217 (P.E.I.S.C., App. Div.), wherein it was decided that a Provincial
Court Judge has jurisdiction to rule on such a motion and to determine the
validity of the counts in an information and that certiorari does not
lie to quash the decision of the Provincial Court Judge acting within his
jurisdiction.

 

Statutory Provisions

 

Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 

                   581.  ...

 

                   (3)  A
count shall contain sufficient detail of the circumstances of the alleged
offence to give to the accused reasonable information with respect to the act
or omission to be proved against him and to identify the transaction referred
to, but otherwise the absence or insufficiency of details does not vitiate the
count.

 

                   601. (1) An objection to an indictment or
to a count in an indictment for a defect apparent on the face thereof shall be
taken by motion to quash the indictment or count before the accused has
pleaded, and thereafter only by leave of the court before which the proceedings
take place, and the court before which an objection is taken under this section
may, if it considers it necessary, order the indictment or count to be amended
to cure the defect.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (3)
Subject to this section, a court shall, at any stage of the proceedings, amend
the indictment or a count therein as may be necessary where it appears

 

(a)
that the indictment has been preferred under a particular Act of Parliament
instead of another Act of Parliament;

 

(b)
that the indictment or a count thereof

 

(i)
fails to state or states defectively anything that is requisite to constitute
the offence,

 

(ii)
does not negative an exception that should be negatived,

 

(iii)
is in any way defective in substance,

 

and
the matters to be alleged in the proposed amendment are disclosed by the
evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry or on the trial; or

 

(c)
that the indictment or a count thereof is in any way defective in form.

 

                   (4)
The court shall, in considering whether or not an amendment should be made to
the indictment or a count thereof under subsection (3), consider

 

(a)
the matters disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry;

 

(b)
the evidence taken on the trial, if any;

 

(c)
the circumstances of the case;

 

(d)
whether the accused has been misled or prejudiced in his defence by any
variance, error or omission mentioned in subsection (2) or (3); and

 

(e)
whether, having regard to the merits of the case, the proposed amendment can be
made without injustice being done.

 

Analysis

 

                   The nub of the
appellant's argument is that this information is a nullity, and that any
proceeding on a nullity is itself a nullity and open to certiorari if no
appeal remedy is then available.

 

                   In my opinion, the
learned Provincial Court Judge was correct in his conclusion that while
""some measure of insufficiency exists in each of the charges, ... it is
not of such a degree as would vitiate the charges"".

 

                   In refusing to
quash the information in this case, the learned Provincial Court Judge was, in
my opinion, acting in conformity with the decision of this Court in R. v.
Moore, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 1097.  The main issue in that case was whether
quashing an information, after plea, for failure to allege a material averment
constitutes a verdict of acquittal for the purpose of pleading autrefois
acquit to a new information.  However, there is to be found in both the
majority and the dissenting reasons in that case, considerable discussion about
the circumstances under which a judge of first instance should quash an
information or indictment.  Dickson C.J., in his dissenting reasons,
stated the following, at p. 1109:

 

If
the document gives fair notice of the offence to the accused, it is not a
nullity and can be amended under the broad powers of amendment s. 529 [now
s. 601 ] gives to the courts.  Only if a charge is so badly drawn up as to
fail even to give the accused notice of the charge will it fail the minimum
test required by s. 510(2)(c) [now s. 581(2)(c)].  A
charge that is this defective would have to be quashed.

 

Although these were dissenting
reasons, Dickson C.J. 's discussion in this regard was adopted without any
reservation in my reasons on behalf of the majority of the Court, at
p. 1126.

 

                   In the same case,
writing for the majority, I said, at p. 1128:

 

                   Since
the enactment of our Code in 1892 there has been, through case law and
punctual amendments to s. 529 [now s. 601 ] and its predecessor
sections, a gradual shift from requiring judges to quash to requiring them to
amend in the stead; in fact, there remains little discretion to quash.  Of
course, if the charge is an absolute nullity, an occurrence the conditions of
which the Chief Justice has set out clearly in his reasons, no cure is
available as the matter goes to the very jurisdiction of the judge.  ... But,
if the charge is only voidable, the judge has jurisdiction to amend.  Even
failure to state something that is an essential ingredient of the offence (and
I am referring to s. 529(3)(b)(i) [now s. 601(3)(b)(i)])
is not fatal; in fact, it is far from being fatal, as the section commands that
the judge ""shall"" amend.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Once the information in this case is
examined in light of these principles, it is clear that the information here
was not so badly drawn up as ""to fail even to give the accused notice of
the charge"".  It was, therefore, not an absolute nullity within the
meaning of R. v. Moore.

 

                   In reaching the
conclusion that he did, the learned Provincial Court Judge was exercising
jurisdiction which he undoubtedly had under s. 601  of the Criminal Code .

 

                   The information not
being a nullity, the major premise of the appellant's argument is therefore not
made out.

 

                   With respect to the
availability of certiorari, the general rule is that the Provincial
Court Judge conducting the preliminary hearing has jurisdiction to determine
the validity of the information and that the correctness of his or her ruling
in that regard cannot be challenged by certiorari.  See, for example,
the decision of Martin J.A. in Re Volpi and Lanzino and The Queen
(1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 13, and the decision of
Schroeder J.A. in R. v. Jarman (1972), 10 C.C.C. (2d) 426 (Ont.
C.A.), at p. 429.  To the same effect is the following passage from
R. E. Salhany, Canadian Criminal Procedure (5th ed. 1989), at
p. 482:

 

The
general view has been that certiorari (or any other extraordinary
remedy) will not lie to review the decision of a trial judge dealing with the
validity of an information or indictment since that decision is within his
jurisdiction.
[Citations omitted; emphasis added.]

 

                   In the instant
case, the information was not an absolute nullity and in deciding whether or
not to quash the learned Provincial Court Judge was exercising jurisdiction he
undoubtedly had under s. 601  of the Criminal Code .  It therefore
follows that this case falls within the general rule just described and that certiorari
was not available to review the learned Provincial Court Judge's decision in
this regard.

 

                   I would not,
however, wish to foreclose entirely resort to certiorari in certain rare
and highly exceptional circumstances.  It may well be that in those rare
circumstances described in R. v. Moore, in which the charge is an
absolute nullity, certiorari may be available.   The existence of some
charge of an offence known to the law, albeit very imperfectly described, is
the basis of the judge's jurisdiction.  There may be rare circumstances in
which an information is so faulty that it fails to meet this basic
requirement.  There may also arise situations in which having failed to quash a
defective information, a Provincial Court Judge finds himself or herself
without jurisdiction.  For example, if a charge does not indicate where the
offence occurred and the Provincial Court Judge refused to quash or order
particulars his or her decision would not be open to review through certiorari. 
However, if as the result of evidence adduced it is revealed that the alleged
offence took place outside the court's jurisdiction, certiorari would
then be available if the judge persisted in continuing exercising a
jurisdiction he or she did not have.  But it would be for that reason, not
because of the decision arrived at under s. 601  that certiorari
would be an appropriate remedy.

 

                   For these reasons,
I would not go so far as to say that certiorari will never be available,
but instances in which certiorari may be had to attack a Provincial
Court Judge's ruling concerning the sufficiency of an information will be rare
and exceptional.

 

                   As the Court
indicated at the conclusion of argument, the appeal is dismissed.

concerning the validity of the trial judge's charge to the jury regarding the
evidence of conspiracy.

 

                   We all agree that
this charge was erroneous.  This error did not cause any prejudice to the
appellant, however.  The essential evidence of the conspiracy was direct, and
not hearsay, and it was given by the co-conspirator Bernard Ferro.  The trial
judge adequately instructed the jury as to the weaknesses and dangers inherent
in his testimony.  The jury could have convicted the appellant only if it was
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt with the evidence given by Ferro.

 

                   In these
circumstances the verdict would necessarily have been the same, even if the
trial judge had not erred in his charge to the jury.

                   The accused was
charged with five counts of trafficking in narcotics, contrary to s. 4 of
the Narcotic Control Act, and was ordered detained until trial.  At the
preliminary inquiry, the accused was committed to trial and the judge refused
his application, under s. 523(2) (b) of the Criminal Code , to
review the order denying bail.  The accused then brought an application for habeas
corpus, arguing that s. 515(6)(d) of the Code is
unconstitutional, and that accordingly his detention was illegal.  This section
provides that an accused charged with having committed a drug offence under
s. 4 or 5 of the Narcotic Control Act, or with conspiracy to commit
any of these offences, shall be detained in custody until trial unless he shows
cause why his detention is not justified.  The Superior Court judge dismissed
the accused's application on the ground that there was an alternative remedy,
namely a review of the bail order under s. 520 of the Code.  The
Court of Appeal allowed the accused's appeal, holding that habeas corpus
was an available remedy in the circumstances and that s. 515(6)(d)
of the Code violates ss. 9 , 11 (d) and 11 (e) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and is not justified under s. 1 . The court
found it unnecessary to analyze s. 515(6) (d) under s. 7  of the Charter .

 

                   Held (La Forest and McLachlin JJ.
dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed and the application for habeas
corpus dismissed.

 

(1)  Habeas Corpus

 

                   In the narrow
circumstances of this case, habeas corpus is available as a remedy
against a denial of bail.  The accused's claim is a special type of
constitutional claim.  He is seeking (1) a determination that s. 515(6)(d)
of the Code violates the Charter  and therefore is of no force and
effect under s. 52  of the Constitution Act, 1982 ; and (2) a remedy
under s. 24(1)  of the Charter , namely a new bail hearing in
accordance with criteria for determining bail which are constitutionally valid. 
Where the refusal to grant bail is challenged in a s. 52  claim coupled
with an application for a remedy under s. 24(1) , habeas corpus is
an adequate remedy.  The constitutional claim can be determined without
evidence about the applicant's specific circumstances.  If the claim is
successful, the court can then order a new bail hearing.  In these
circumstances, an application for habeas corpus must not fail merely
because another remedy is also available.  Technical legal distinctions which
interfere with the court's ability to adjudicate Charter  claims are to
be rejected.  Outside the narrow circumstances of this case, however, habeas
corpus is not an appropriate remedy for a denial of bail.  Under
s. 24(1) of the Charter , courts should not allow habeas corpus
applications to be used to circumvent the appropriate appeal process.  In
general, a challenge to a denial of bail should be brought by means of a review
under s. 520 of the Code.

 

(2)  Validity of
s. 515(6)(d) of the Criminal Code

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka and
Iacobucci JJ.:  Section 515(6)(d) of the Code, to the extent
that it requires the accused to show cause why detention is not justified, does
not violate ss. 7 , 9 , 11 (d) or 11 (e) of the Charter .  

 

                   Section 11 (d)
of the Charter  creates a procedural and evidentiary rule which operates
at the trial requiring the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond
a reasonable doubt.  This section has no application at the bail stage of the
criminal process where guilt or innocence is not determined and where
punishment is not imposed.  But s. 11(d) does not exhaust the
operation of the presumption of innocence as a principle of fundamental justice
under s. 7  of the Charter .  The presumption of innocence under s. 7 
applies at all stages of the criminal process and its particular requirements
will vary according to the context in which it comes to be applied.  In this
case, however, the Charter  challenge falls to be determined according to
s. 11 (e) of the Charter , rather than under s. 7 .  Section
11 (e) offers ""a highly specific guarantee"" which covers
precisely the accused's complaint.  The substantive right in s. 7  to be
presumed innocent at the bail stage does not contain any procedural content
beyond that contained in s. 11 (e).

 

                   Section 11 (e)
creates a broad right guaranteeing both the right to obtain bail and the right
to have that bail set on reasonable terms.  The meaning of ""bail"" in
s. 11 (e) includes all forms of judicial interim release.  While s.
515(6)(d) requires the accused to demonstrate that detention is not
justified, thereby denying the basic entitlement under s. 11 (e) to be
granted bail unless pre-trial detention is justified by the prosecution, it
provides ""just cause"" to deny bail in certain circumstances and
therefore does not violate s. 11 (e).  First, the denial of bail occurs
only in a narrow set of circumstances. Second, it is necessary to promote the
proper functioning of the bail system and is not undertaken for any purpose
extraneous to the bail system.  Section 515(6)(d) applies only to a very
small number of offences, all of which involve the distribution of narcotics,
and bail is denied only when the persons who are charged with these offences
are unable to demonstrate that detention is not justified having regard to the
specified grounds set out in s. 515(10)(a) and (b) of the Code. 
The special bail rules in s. 515(6)(d) merely establish an effective
bail system for specific offences for which the normal bail system would allow
continuing criminal behaviour and an intolerable risk of absconding.  Because
of their unique characteristics, the offences subject to s. 515(6)(d)
are generally committed in a very different context than most other crimes. 
Trafficking in narcotics occurs systematically, usually within a highly
sophisticated and lucrative commercial setting, creating huge incentives for an
offender to continue criminal behaviour even after arrest and release on bail. 
There is also a marked danger that an accused charged with these offences will
abscond rather than appear for trial.  Drug importers and traffickers have
access both to a large amount of funds and to organizations which can assist in
a flight from justice.  The special bail rules in s. 515(6)(d)
combat the pre‑trial recidivism and absconding problems by requiring the
accused to demonstrate that they will not arise.  The scope of these special
rules is thus carefully tailored to achieve a properly functioning bail system.
Section 515(6)(d) also applies to small or casual drug dealers, but
they will normally have no difficulty justifying their release and obtaining
bail.  Section 515(6)(d) allows differential treatment based on the
seriousness of the offence.  Moreover, the onus which it imposes is reasonable
in the sense that it requires the accused to provide information which he is
most capable of providing.

 

                   While
s. 515(6)(d) provides for persons to be ""detained"" within
the meaning of s. 9  of the Charter , those persons are not detained
""arbitrarily"".  Detention under s. 515(6) (d) is not
governed by unstructured discretion.  The section fixes specific conditions for
bail.  Furthermore, the bail process is subject to very exacting procedural
guarantees and subject to review by a superior court.

 

                   Normally an order
for a new bail hearing would have been issued under s. 686(8) of the Code
and a reasonable opportunity given to the accused to show cause why his
detention is not justified having regard to the grounds set out in
s. 515(10) , including s. 515(10) (b) as altered by this Court
in Morales. There will be no such order in this case, however, since the
accused has already been tried, convicted and sentenced.  That order would be
of no force or effect as the issue of the accused's liberty is moot.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé and
Gonthier JJ.:  The reasons of Lamer C.J. were agreed with,
subject to the reasons of Gonthier J. in Morales in which he
concludes that the criterion of public interest in s. 515(10)(b) of
the Code is not unconstitutional, and subject to some concerns about the
manner in which the presumption of innocence, as an integral value protected by
s. 7  of the Charter , is dealt with by the Chief Justice in relation
to the bail provisions of the Code.  The analysis leading to the
decision as to bail entails a consideration and weighing of the accused's
entitlement to bail or liberty interest on the one hand, and the circumstances
provided for in s. 515(10)  which may justify a denial of bail on the
other.  The liberty interest is only one albeit an important factor to be considered
and may be outweighed by others.

 

                   Per McLachlin J. (dissenting): 
The reasons of Lamer C.J. were agreed with except for his conclusion that
s. 515(6)(d) of the Code does not violate s. 11 (e)
of the Charter .  Section 515(6) (d) denies bail to all persons
charged with having committed an offence under s. 4 or 5 of the Narcotic
Control Act who cannot show cause why their detention in custody is not
justified.  This section fails to distinguish between the large‑scale
commercial drug trafficker and small or casual traffickers and its wide scope
can be used to deny bail to people when there is no reason or ""just
cause"" for doing so.  The risk that the accused will continue his criminal
activity while awaiting trial or will abscond and not appear for trial may be
""just cause"" for denying bail to persons charged with serious, large‑scale
or commercial trafficking, but these reasons do not apply to other
traffickers.  Where bail is denied without just cause, s. 11 (e) of
the Charter  is infringed.  The mere possibility of denial of bail
without ""just cause"" is enough to overturn s. 515(6) (d).

 

                   Section 515(6)(d)
of the Code is not justifiable under s. 1  of the Charter . 
While the legislative objectives of avoiding repeat offences and absconding are
of sufficient importance to warrant overriding a constitutional right,
s. 515(6) (d) goes further than is necessary to achieve those
objectives.  There is no reason to conclude that small and casual traffickers
pose any particular threat of repeating the offence or fleeing from their
trial.  Section 515(6) (d) is thus of no force and effect pursuant to
s. 52  of the Constitution Act, 1982 .

 

                   Per La Forest J. (dissenting): For the
reasons given by McLachlin J., s. 515(6)(d) of the Code violates
s. 11 (e) of the Charter  and is not justifiable under s. 1 .  It is
unnecessary to deal with the other provisions of the Charter .

//Lamer C.J.//

 

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and Sopinka and Iacobucci JJ. was delivered by

 

                   Lamer C.J. -- This appeal was argued
along with R. v. Morales, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 000.  Both cases involve the
constitutionality of the bail provisions of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-46 , and for the first time require this Court to examine the scope
of the right to bail under s. 11 (e) of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms .

 

I - Facts

 

                   The respondent
Edwin Pearson was arrested in September 1989 and charged with five counts of
trafficking in narcotics, contrary to s. 4 of the Narcotic Control Act,
R.S.C., 1985, c. N-1.  A bail hearing was held shortly after his arrest. 
Pearson was denied bail and ordered detained in custody until trial.

 

                   Shortly thereafter,
a preliminary inquiry was held and Pearson was committed to trial.  At the end
of the preliminary inquiry, Pearson brought an application to the preliminary
inquiry judge under s. 523(2) (b) of the Criminal Code  to review
the order that he remain in custody until trial.  The preliminary inquiry judge
refused to review this order.

 

                   Pearson then
brought an application for habeas corpus.  He argued that s. 515(6) (d)
of the Criminal Code  is unconstitutional, and that accordingly his
detention was illegal.  The habeas corpus application was heard by Biron
J. of the Quebec Superior Court on November 17, 1989.  At the outset of the
hearing, the Attorney General of Canada obtained leave to intervene in the
application and moved to dismiss the application on the ground that there was
an alternative remedy, namely a review of the bail order under s. 520  of the Criminal
Code .  Biron J. granted this motion and dismissed Pearson's application.

 

                   Pearson appealed. 
On September 10, 1990, the Quebec Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, holding
that habeas corpus was an available remedy in the circumstances and that
s. 515(6) (d) of the Criminal Code  violates ss. 9 , 11 (d)
and 11 (e) of the Charter :  [1990] R.J.Q. 2438, 59 C.C.C. (3d)
406, 5 C.R.R. (2d) 164, 79 C.R. (3d) 90.

 

                   The Attorney
General of Quebec now appeals to this Court.  The Attorney General of Canada,
the Attorney General for Ontario and the Attorney General for Saskatchewan have
intervened in support of the position taken by the Attorney General of Quebec. 
The Criminal Lawyers' Association has intervened in support of the position
taken by the respondent.

 

II - Relevant Statutory and
Constitutional Provisions

 

                   At issue in this
appeal is the validity of s. 515(6) (d) of the Criminal Code ,
which reads as follows:

 

                   515.  . . .

 

                   (6) 
Notwithstanding any provision of this section, where an accused is charged

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(d)
with having committed an offence under section 4 or 5 of the Narcotic
Control Act or the offence of conspiring to commit an offence under section
4 or 5 of that Act,

 

the
justice shall order that the accused be detained in custody until he is dealt
with according to law, unless the accused, having been given a reasonable
opportunity to do so, shows cause why his detention in custody is not
justified, but where the justice orders that the accused be released, he shall
include in the record a statement of his reasons for making the order.

 

                   Section 515(6) (d)
is challenged under ss. 7 , 9 , 11 (d) and 11 (e) of the Charter ,
which read as follows:

 

                   7.  Everyone has the right to life,
liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof
except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

 

                   9.  Everyone has the right not to be
arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.

 

                   11.  Any person charged with an offence
has the right

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(d)
to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in  fair and
public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal;

 

(e)
not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause;

 

III --  Lower Court Judgments

 

Quebec Superior Court

 

                   Biron J. held that
the application for habeas corpus was a disguised review of the order
that Pearson be detained in custody until trial.  Biron J. held that such a
review should have been brought under s. 520  of the Criminal Code , and
that it would be incongruous to release Pearson solely on the basis of the
unconstitutionality of s. 515(6) (d).  A review under s. 520  could
determine the constitutional issue and could also determine whether, without
application of s. 515(6) (d), the accused should be granted bail.

 

                   As a result, Biron
J. dismissed the application, but expressly reserved the right to bring an
application for review in the appropriate form.

 

Quebec Court of Appeal (Rothman, Baudouin and Proulx JJ.A.)

 

                   The reasons of the
court were delivered by Proulx J.A.  Considering the availability of habeas
corpus as a means to attack the constitutionality of s. 515(6) (d),
Proulx J.A. held that Pearson's application was effectively an application for
a remedy under s. 24(1)  of the Charter , and accordingly no recourse to habeas
corpus was needed at all.  Furthermore, according to R. v. Gamble,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 595, in the constitutional context a valid application for habeas
corpus could not fail merely because another remedy was also available. 
Proulx J.A. disagreed with Biron J.'s conclusion that the application was a
disguised review of the order that Pearson be detained in custody until trial. 
A review has a different scope than an application for habeas corpus. 
In a review, an applicant can adduce fresh evidence and argue that the justice
made a manifest error in assessing the evidence.  An application for habeas
corpus would be restricted to the constitutional issue.  Proulx J.A. held
that Pearson could not be deprived of his right to this remedy.

 

                   On the merits of
the application, Proulx J.A. held that the right to bail under s. 11 (e)
is not absolute but rather is limited by the concept of ""just
cause"".  He considered several definitions of ""just cause"" and
noted that pre-trial detention entails serious repercussions.  Proulx J.A. held
that bail constitutes an essential element of procedural equity and is a right
closely related to the rights under ss. 9  and 11 (d).  In this context,
Proulx J.A. held that ""just cause"" must consist of a restriction
which is rational, necessary, equitable and consistent with other procedural
guarantees.  Proulx J.A. held that the primary and secondary grounds for
detention of an accused which are set out in s. 515(10)  constitute just cause
justifying the deprivation of liberty.

 

                   Proulx J.A. held
that it is completely arbitrary and unjust to create an exception to the bail
regime without considering the nature of the narcotic, the seriousness of the
offence, the likelihood of conviction, the degree of participation and the
individual's specific circumstances.  There is no rational basis for treating
someone charged with possession of a small quantity of hashish for the purpose
of trafficking in the same manner as a repeat offender charged with trafficking
cocaine.  The situation is worsened by the lack of analogous treatment of more
dangerous offences, such as sexual assault, domestic assault and extortion. 
Furthermore, the onus on the accused is not even necessary because the Crown
has the opportunity to oppose bail and to show that the public interest
requires the detention of the accused.

 

                   Proulx J.A. held
that s. 515(6) (d) is inconsistent with the concept of just cause because
it requires persons accused of certain offences to be detained unless there is
just cause to release them.  Proulx J.A. also found the manner of applying this
regime on the basis of the charge laid against the accused to be arbitrary and
discriminatory.

 

                   Turning to s. 11 (d),
Proulx J.A. held that the presumption of innocence applies at all stages of
criminal proceedings, and not just at the stage of ultimate disposition. 
Proulx J.A. held that a general rule of mandatory detention based solely on the
charge prevents the treatment of the accused as a person who is presumed
innocent.  Detention increases the likelihood that the accused will be found guilty. 
In addition, Proulx J.A. noted that s. 11 (d) protects the right to a
fair trial, and held that the rights to a fair trial and to make full answer
and defence cannot be preserved without the right to bail.

 

                   Turning to ss. 7 
and 9 , Proulx J.A. held that his analysis of s. 11 (e) indicated the
arbitrary character of s. 515(6) (d).  This approach led him to conclude
that s. 515(6) (d) violates s. 9 .  Given that he had found violations of
ss. 9 , 11 (d) and 11 (e), Proulx J.A. found it unnecessary to
analyze s. 515(6) (d) under s. 7 .

 

                   Finally, Proulx
J.A. turned to s. 1 .  He found that s. 515(6) (d) passed the first branch
of the test in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, but failed the second
branch.  Proulx J.A. found no rational connection between the objective and the
means chosen.  The provision was discriminatory and arbitrary, and it had not
been demonstrated that interim detention could reduce the incidence of crime. 
Proulx J.A. also found that the restriction did not constitute a minimal
infringement of Charter  rights.  The goal of protecting the public could
be achieved by using the general regime set out in s. 515 .  Experience in the
United States and England also served to demonstrate that such an arbitrary
measure is unnecessary to achieve the objective which is shared in all free and
democratic societies.  As a result, Proulx J.A. held that s. 515(6) (d)
was not justified under s. 1 .

 

                   As a result, the
appeal was allowed and s. 515(6) (d) was held to violate ss. 9 , 11 (d)
and 11 (e) of the Charter .

 

IV - Issues

 

                   The following
constitutional questions were stated on April 9, 1991:

 

1.Does
s. 515(6)(d) of the Criminal Code  of Canada limit the rights
guaranteed in ss. 7 , 9 , 11 (d) and 11 (e) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If
so, is s. 515(6) (d) of the Criminal Code  of Canada a reasonable
limit prescribed by law that can be demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society, as required by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms ?

 

V - Analysis

 

A.  Habeas Corpus

 

                   Before considering
the constitutional issues in this case, it is necessary to consider a
preliminary issue involving the scope of habeas corpus.  The appellant
submits that habeas corpus is not available in this case because an
alternative remedy exists, namely a bail review under s. 520  of the Criminal
Code .  While in general habeas corpus is not available as a remedy
against a denial of bail, in my opinion habeas corpus is available as a
remedy in the narrow circumstances of this case.

 

                   The availability of
habeas corpus in this case is closely tied to the nature of the claim. 
The claim in this case is a constitutional claim.  Moreover, it is a special
type of constitutional claim.  The respondent is seeking two constitutional
remedies.  First, he is seeking a determination that s. 515(6) (d) of the
Criminal Code  violates the Charter  and therefore is of no force
and effect under s. 52  of the Constitution Act, 1982 .  Second, he is
seeking a remedy under s. 24(1) , namely a new bail hearing in accordance with
criteria for determining bail which are constitutionally valid.  Thus the
respondent is making a s. 52  challenge coupled with an application for a s.
24(1)  remedy.

 

                   In R. v. Gamble,
supra, Wilson J. reviewed the scope of habeas corpus as a Charter 
remedy.  She held that habeas corpus is a flexible Charter  remedy
which should be applied purposively in order to permit proper adjudication of Charter 
claims.  She stated at p. 638:

 

                   In
general, applicants for Charter  relief should, I believe, be allowed a
reasonable measure of flexibility in framing their claims for relief in light
of the interests the Charter  rights on which they rely were designed to
protect.

 

Further, at p. 640 she stated:

 

. .
. it is understandable that courts have, in general, not bound themselves to
limited categories or definitions of jurisdictional review when the liberty of
the subject was at stake.  I think that this trend should be affirmed where habeas
corpus is sought as a Charter  remedy and that distinctions which
have become uncertain, technical, artificial and, most importantly,
non-purposive should be rejected.

 

Thus the emphasis in Gamble is
to ensure that Charter  claims are adjudicated.  Technical legal
distinctions which interfere with the court's ability to adjudicate Charter 
claims are to be rejected.

 

                   Most challenges to
a refusal to grant bail cannot be properly addressed by means of habeas
corpus.  In a bail review under s. 520 , all the circumstances which are
relevant to a determination of bail are before the court: see, for example, s.
15 of the Rules of Practice of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec,
Criminal Division, which requires an affidavit setting out precisely the
information needed by a court making a s. 520  review.  Such evidence will not
normally be before the court in an application for habeas corpus, making
a proper reassessment of a bail order impossible.

 

                   However, where the
refusal to grant bail is challenged in a s. 52  claim coupled with an
application for a remedy under s. 24(1) , habeas corpus is an adequate
remedy. The constitutional claim can be determined without evidence about the
applicant's specific circumstances.  If the claim is successful, the court can
order a new bail hearing to be held in accordance with constitutionally valid
criteria.  In these circumstances, I am of the opinion that to refuse to
address the respondent's claim simply because another remedy exists would be to
adopt the very type of uncertain, artificial, technical and non-purposive
distinction which Wilson J. rejected in Gamble.  The respondent's Charter 
claim must be adjudicated.  The rubric under which the claim is advanced should
not interfere with the Court's duty to adjudicate the claim.  It would be
overly technical and would place form over substance to dismiss the
respondent's application on the sole ground that he framed it as an application
for habeas corpus.

 

                   Outside the narrow
circumstances of this case, habeas corpus is not a remedy for a denial
of bail.  As Wilson J. noted in Gamble at p. 642, ""[u]nder section
24(1)  of the Charter  courts should not allow habeas corpus
applications to be used to circumvent the appropriate appeal process"".  In
the context of bail, a s. 520  review is the ""appropriate appeal
process"" which should not be circumvented by habeas corpus.  This
approach is consistent with McIntyre J.'s holding in Mills v. The Queen,
[1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, at p. 959, that Charter  remedies are subject to
normal and established procedures and do not create the right to bring an
interlocutory appeal.  The undesirability of interlocutory Charter 
appeals was also noted in R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at pp.
638-39.  Allowing the use of habeas corpus as a general remedy for a
bail review would create precisely this type of interlocutory appeal (see s.
784(3)  of the Criminal Code , which provides for an appeal against a
refusal of habeas corpus).

 

                   In Steele v.
Mountain Institution, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1385, Cory J. warned at p. 1418
against allowing habeas corpus to develop as a costly and unwieldy
system parallel to an existing system of judicial review:

 

                   It
is necessary to make a further comment.  As I have made clear above, the
continuing detention of a dangerous offender sentenced pursuant to the
constitutionally valid provisions of the Criminal Code  will only violate
s. 12  of the Charter  when the National Parole Board errs in the
execution of its vital duties of tailoring the indeterminate sentence to the
circumstances of the offender.  This tailoring is performed by applying the
criteria set out in s. 16(1) of the Parole Act.  Since any error that
may be committed occurs in the parole review process itself, an application
challenging the decision should be made by means of judicial review from the
National Parole Board decision, not by means of an application for habeas
corpus.  It would be wrong to sanction the establishment of a costly and
unwieldy parallel system for challenging a Parole Board decision.

 

Similarly, since any error in the
denial of bail occurs within the normal bail review process, a challenge to a
denial of bail should be brought by means of a review under s. 520  rather than
an application for habeas corpus.  Just as habeas corpus should
not become a costly and unwieldy parallel system of parole review, it should
not become a costly and unwieldy parallel system of bail review.

 

                   In most cases, habeas
corpus is not a remedy against a refusal to grant bail.  However, in the
narrow circumstances of this case, it was open to the respondent to frame his Charter 
claim as an application for habeas corpus.  This Charter claim
must be adjudicated.

 

B.  Validity of Section 515(6) (d)

 

                   (1)Sections
7  and 11 (d): Fundamental Justice and the Presumption of Innocence

 

                   The presumption of
innocence has been described as the ""golden thread"" woven throughout
the web of the criminal law (see Woolmington v. Director of Public
Prosecutions, [1935] A.C. 462 (H.L.), at p. 481).  It is also the common
thread linking the various issues in this appeal.  This appeal examines the
validity of s. 515(6) (d) of the Criminal Code  under ss. 7 , 9 , 11 (d)
and 11 (e) of the Charter .  Each of these Charter  issues is
linked by a single concept, namely the presumption of innocence.

 

                   As I noted in Re
B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at p. 512, ""[s]ections 8
to 14 [of the Charter ] address specific deprivations of the
""right"" to life, liberty and security of the person in breach of
principles of fundamental justice, and as such, violations of s. 7 .  They are
therefore illustrative of the meaning, in criminal or penal law, of
""principles of fundamental justice"""".  Consistent with this
view, this Court has held that the presumption of innocence, ""[a]lthough
protected expressly in s. 11 (d) of the Charter  . . . is referable
and integral to the general protection of life, liberty and security of the
person contained in s. 7  of the Charter "": R. v. Oakes, supra,
per Dickson C.J., at p. 119.

 

                   Section 11 (d)
of the Charter  sets out the presumption of innocence in the context of
its operation at the trial of an accused person.  As I stated in Dubois v.
The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 350, at p. 357:

 

                   Section
11 (d) imposes upon the Crown the burden of proving the accused's guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt as well as that of making out the case against the
accused before he or she need respond, either by testifying or by calling other
evidence.

 

                   This operation of
the presumption of innocence at trial, where the accused's guilt of an offence
is in issue, does not, in my opinion, exhaust the operation in the criminal
process of the presumption of innocence as a principle of fundamental justice. 
The presumption of innocence, as a substantive principle of fundamental justice
""protects the fundamental liberty and human dignity of any and every
person accused by the State of criminal conduct"":  Oakes, supra,
at p. 119.  In my view, the presumption of innocence is an animating principle
throughout the criminal justice process.  The fact that it comes to be applied
in its strict evidentiary sense at trial pursuant to s. 11 (d) of the Charter ,
in no way diminishes the broader principle of fundamental justice that the
starting point for any proposed deprivation of life, liberty or security of the
person of anyone charged with or suspected of an offence must be that the
person is innocent.

 

                   This, of course,
does not mean that there can be no deprivation of life, liberty or security of
the person until guilt is established beyond reasonable doubt by the
prosecution at trial.  As I noted in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra,
at p. 512,  ""[t]he term ""principles of fundamental justice"" is
not a right, but a qualifier of the right not to be deprived of life, liberty
and security of the person; its function is to set the parameters of that
right."" The illustrations of deprivations of life, liberty and security of
the person otherwise than in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice set out in ss. 8  to 14  of the Charter  are suggestive of this
conclusion.  Section 8  speaks in terms of unreasonable search and
seizure, s. 9 of arbitrary detention and s. 11(e) of the right
not to be denied reasonable bail ""without just cause"".  Each
of these specific examples is consistent with the view that certain
deprivations of liberty and security of the person may be in accordance with
the principles of fundamental justice where there are reasonable grounds for
doing so, rather than only after guilt has been established beyond a reasonable
doubt.  As the majority of this Court (per La Forest J.) noted in R.
v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 361:

 

It
is also clear that the requirements of fundamental justice are not immutable;
rather, they vary according to the context in which they are invoked.  Thus,
certain procedural protections might be constitutionally mandated in one
context but not in another. 

 

                   This is true with
respect to the presumption of innocence as a substantive principle of
fundamental justice within s. 7  of the Charter .  While the presumption
is pervasive in the criminal process, its particular requirements will vary
according to the context in which it comes to be applied.

 

                   In determining the
precise content of the substantive principle in a specific context, the
examples given in the Charter  itself, ss. 8  to 14 , will be instructive,
as will ""the basic principles of penal policy that have animated
legislative and judicial practice in Canada and other common law
jurisdictions"" (R. v. Lyons, supra, at p. 327).

 

                   Examples are legion
of how the various stages of the criminal process have accommodated themselves
to the fundamental principle that the assumed innocence of an accused or a
suspect is the starting point for any proposed interference with that person's
life, liberty or security of the person.  In general, one who proposes to lay
an information must believe, on reasonable grounds, that an offence has been
committed: see, e.g., Criminal Code , s. 504 .  The justice receiving the
information must consider, before issuing process, that a case for doing so has
been made out:  see, e.g., Criminal Code , s. 507(1) .  Much the same may
be said with respect to the power to arrest.  In general, a peace officer must
have reasonable grounds to effect the arrest.  There must be reasonable and
probable grounds to demand a breath sample under s. 254(3) of the Code,
and reasonable grounds must be shown before a search warrant may be issued: s.
487(1).  Each of these cases may be seen as an example of the broad but
flexible scope of the presumption of innocence as a principle of fundamental
justice under s. 7  of the Charter .  The principle does not necessarily
require anything in the nature of proof beyond reasonable doubt, because the
particular step in the process does not involve a determination of guilt. 
Precisely what is required depends upon the basic  tenets of our legal system
as exemplified by specific Charter  rights, basic principles of penal
policy as viewed in the light of ""an analysis of the nature, sources, rationale
and essential role of that principle within the judicial process and in our
legal system, as it evolves"":  Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra,
at p. 513.

 

                   The interaction of
s. 7  and s. 11 (d) is also nicely illustrated at the sentencing stage of
the criminal process.  The presumption of innocence as set out in s. 11 (d)
arguably has no application at the sentencing stage of the trial.  However, it
is clear law that where the Crown advances aggravating facts in sentencing
which are contested, the Crown must establish those facts beyond reasonable
doubt:  R. v. Gardiner, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368.  The Court in Gardiner
cited with approval at p. 415 the following passage from J. A. Olah,
""Sentencing:  The Last Frontier of the Criminal Law"" (1980), 16 C.R.
(3d) 97, at p. 121:

 

. .
. because the sentencing process poses the ultimate jeopardy to an individual .
. . in the criminal process, it is just and reasonable that he be granted the
protection of the reasonable doubt rule at this vital juncture of the process.

 

                   Although, of
course, Gardiner was not a Charter  case, the problem it
confronted can readily be restated in terms of ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter . 
While the presumption of innocence as specifically articulated in s. 11 (d)
may not cover the question of the standard of proof of contested aggravating
facts at sentencing, the broader substantive principle in s. 7  almost certainly
would.  The specific application of the right would take account of the serious
consequences adverted to in the passage from Olah, cited by the Court in Gardiner.

 

                   A further possible
example of the presumption of innocence operating as a principle of fundamental
justice may be found in the area of civil contempt.  It may well be, of course,
that a person facing civil contempt proceedings is ""charged with an
offence"" within the meaning of s. 11  of the Charter .  But even if
not, I would be attracted to the argument that the presumption of innocence,
requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt, would apply as a principle of
fundamental justice under s. 7  of the Charter .  This would be consistent
with the practice in both the civil law (see, e.g., Imperial Oil Ltd. v.
Tanguay, [1971] C.A. 109) and common law (see, e.g., Dean v. Dean,
[1987] 1 F.L.R. 517 (Eng. C.A.)).

 

                   I should add that
in advancing the numerous examples from statute law and elsewhere, I am not
deciding whether any one of them exactly or fully reflects the dictates of the
presumption of innocence as a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7  of
the Charter .  I note these examples by way of illustration only to show
the pervasive presence of the broad substantive principle throughout the
criminal process and to underline the point that s. 11 (d), while having
its specific operation at trial, does not exhaust the broader principle of
fundamental justice which is enshrined in s. 7 .

 

                   The effect of the
presumption of innocence at trial is entrenched in s. 11 (d).  There has
developed a long line of authority establishing a very specific understanding
of s. 11 (d) as a right which is violated if conviction is possible
despite the existence of a reasonable doubt about guilt.  In Oakes, supra,
at p. 132, Dickson C.J. described s. 11 (d) as follows:

 

 

                   In
general one must, I think, conclude that a provision which requires an accused
to disprove on a balance of probabilities the existence of a presumed fact,
which is an important element of the offence in question, violates the
presumption of innocence in s. 11 (d).  If an accused bears the burden of
disproving on a balance of probabilities an essential element of the offence, it
would be possible for a conviction to occur despite the existence of a
reasonable doubt.  [Emphasis added.]

 

After Oakes, this understanding
of s. 11 (d) was reiterated in R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
636, at p. 655; R. v. Whyte, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 3; R. v. Chaulk,
[1990] 3 S.C.R. 1303, at pp. 1330-31, and R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc.,
[1991] 3 S.C.R. 154, at pp. 196-97.  Thus the effect of s. 11 (d) is to
create a procedural and evidentiary rule at trial that the prosecution must
prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  This procedural and evidentiary rule
has no application at the bail stage of the criminal process, where the guilt
or innocence of the accused is not determined and where punishment is not
imposed.  Accordingly, s. 515(6)(d) does not violate s. 11 (d).

 

                   I am of the view
that s. 11 (d) does not exhaust the operation of the presumption of
innocence as a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7 .

 

                   However, in this case,
I am also of the view that the Charter  challenge falls to be determined
according to s. 11 (e) of the Charter , rather than under s. 7 . 
Section 11 (e) offers ""a highly specific guarantee"" which
covers precisely the respondent's complaint.  As I said in R. v. Généreux,
[1992] 1 S.C.R. 259, at p. 310:

 

                   The
appellant places reliance upon both s. 11 (d) and s. 7  of the Charter . 
However, the s. 7  submission can be dealt with very briefly.  In Re B.C.
Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, this Court decided that ss. 8  to 14 
of the Charter , the ""legal rights"", are specific instances of
the basic tenets of fairness upon which our legal system is based, and which
are now entrenched as a constitutional minimum standard by s. 7 .  Consequently,
in the context of the appellant's challenge to the independence of the General
Court Martial before which he was tried, s. 7  does not offer greater protection
than the highly specific guarantee under s. 11 (d).  I do not wish to be
understood to suggest by this that the rights guaranteed by ss. 8  to 14  of the Charter 
are exhaustive of the content of s. 7 , or that there will not be circumstances
where s. 7  provides a more compendious protection that these sections
combined.  However, in this case, the appellant has complained of a specific
infringement which falls squarely within s. 11 (d), and consequently his
argument is not strengthened by pleading the more open language of s. 7 .

 

                   Viewed in this
light, ss. 11 (d) and 11 (e) are parallel rights.  Section 11 (e)
entrenches the effect of the presumption of innocence at the bail stage of the
criminal process.  Section 11 (d) does the same at the trial stage.  
Sections 11 (d) and 11 (e) define the procedural content of the
presumption of innocence at the bail and trial stages of the criminal process,
and constitute both the extent and the limit of that presumption at those
stages.  The substantive right in s. 7  to be presumed innocent is operative at
both the bail and trial stages, in the sense that it creates a legal rule that
the accused is presumed legally innocent until proven guilty, but it does not
contain any procedural content beyond that contained in ss. 11 (d) and
11 (e).  Thus s. 515(6)(d) does not violate s. 7  unless it fails
to meet the procedural requirements of s. 11 (e).

 

                   (2)  Section 11 (e)

 

                   (i) The Scope of
the Right

 

                   This Court has
never before been called upon to define the scope of the right contained in s.
11 (e).  As a result, some preliminary remarks about s. 11 (e) are
in order.

 

                   Section 11 (e)
guarantees the right of any person charged with an offence ""not to be
denied reasonable bail without just cause"".  In my opinion, s. 11 (e)
contains two distinct elements, namely the right to ""reasonable bail""
and the right not to be denied bail without ""just cause"".  The French
version of s. 11 (e) makes this distinction clearer than does the English
version.  The French version guarantees the right ""de ne pas être privé
sans juste cause d'une mise en liberté assortie d'un cautionnement raisonnable"". 
This wording demonstrates that two separate rights are operative, namely the
right ""de ne pas être privé sans juste cause d'une mise en liberté""
(""not to be denied release without just cause"") and the right to have
that release ""assortie d'un cautionnement raisonnable""
(""subject to reasonable bail"").

 

                   ""Reasonable
bail"" refers to the terms of bail.  Thus the quantum of bail and the
restrictions imposed on the accused's liberty while on bail must be
""reasonable"".  ""Just cause"" refers to the right to obtain
bail.  Thus bail must not be denied unless there is ""just cause"" to
do so.  The ""just cause"" aspect of s. 11 (e) imposes
constitutional standards on the grounds under which bail is granted or denied.

 

                   The dual aspect of
s. 11 (e) can be contrasted with the comparable provision in the United
States.  In the United States, the excessive bail clause of the Eighth
Amendment provides only that ""[e]xcessive bail shall not be
required"".  While this wording clearly refers to the terms of bail, there
has been considerable debate about whether it also creates a right to obtain
bail:  see Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1 (1951), at p. 4; Carlson v.
Landon, 342 U.S. 524 (1952), at p. 545; United States v. Edwards, 430
A.2d 1321 (D.C. 1981), at pp. 1325-26 and 1329-30, certiorari denied 455
U.S. 1022 (1982); United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987), at pp.
752-55, and D. B. Verrilli Jr., ""The Eighth Amendment and the Right to
Bail: Historical Perspectives"" (1982), 82 Colum. L. Rev. 328.  In
Canada, there can no such doubt about the scope of s. 11 (e).  Section
11 (e) creates a broad right guaranteeing both the right to obtain bail
and the right to have that bail set on reasonable terms.

 

                   The dual aspect of
s. 11(e) mandates a broad interpretation of the word ""bail"" in
s. 11(e).  If s. 11(e) guarantees the right to obtain
""bail"" on terms which are reasonable, then ""bail"" must
refer to all forms of what is formally known under the Criminal Code  as
""judicial interim release"".  In common parlance, ""bail""
sometimes refers to the money or other valuable security which the accused is
required to deposit with the court as a condition of release.  Restricting
""bail"" to this meaning would render s. 11 (e) nugatory because
most accused are released on less onerous terms.  In order to be an effective
guarantee, the meaning of ""bail"" in s. 11 (e) must include all
forms of judicial interim release.

 

                   My conclusion about
the meaning of ""bail"" in s. 11(e) leads me to a comment about
terminology.  Throughout these reasons, use of the word ""bail""
reflects the meaning of the word as it is used in s. 11(e).  Thus a
reference in these reasons to ""bail"" should be read as a reference to
judicial interim release in general and not as a reference to any particular
form of interim release.

 

                   Most of the current
bail provisions in the Criminal Code  were enacted in the Bail Reform
Act, S.C. 1970-71-72, c. 37.  The Bail Reform Act established a
basic entitlement to bail.  Bail must be granted unless pre-trial detention is
justified by the prosecution.  In R. v. Bray (1983), 2 C.C.C. (3d) 325
(Ont. C.A.), at p. 328, Martin J.A. described the Bail Reform Act as
""a liberal and enlightened system of pre-trial release"".  In my view,
s. 11 (e) transforms the basic entitlement of this liberal and
enlightened system into a constitutional right.  Section 11 (e) creates a
basic entitlement to be granted reasonable bail unless there is just cause to
do otherwise. 

 

                   Section 515(6)(d)
must be placed in context.  In general, a person charged with an offence and
produced before a justice, unless he or she pleads guilty, is to be released on
an undertaking without conditions.   However, the Crown is to be given a
reasonable opportunity to show cause why either detention or some other order
should be made:  s. 515(1).  Detention may be justified on the primary ground
that ""his detention is necessary to ensure his attendance in court""
or, on the secondary ground that ""detention is necessary in the public
interest or for the protection or safety of the public . . ."":  s.
515(10) (a) and (b).

 

                   Under s. 515(6)(d),
where the accused is charged with an offence under the Narcotics Control Act,
s. 4 (trafficking or possession for the purpose of trafficking) or s. 5
(importing or exporting), or with conspiracy to commit any of these offences,
the justice is to order the accused's detention.  The accused, however, is to
be afforded a reasonable opportunity to show cause why detention is not
justified having regard to the primary and secondary grounds noted above.

 

                   As with other
orders made under s. 515(2), (5), (7) or (8), an order under subs. (6) is
subject to review by a judge at any time before trial and, in fact, successive
reviews, provided they are at least 30 days apart, are permitted:  see ss.
520(1) and 520(8).  There is a further review mechanism where the trial has not
occurred within 90 days of the accused's detention:  see s. 525(1).  The judge
conducting the review is to take into consideration whether there has been
unreasonable delay:  see s. 525(3).   With respect to offences under ss. 4 and
5 of the Narcotic Control Act, the accused has the right to elect to
have a preliminary inquiry at which the justice is to determine whether there
is some evidence relating to each element of the charge.  If the accused is
discharged, the detention order also comes to an end.  Even if committed to
stand trial, the justice may vacate a detention order previously made:  see s.
523(2) .

 

                   It is within the
framework of these general remarks about the nature of s. 11(e) and the
context of the bail process that I will now consider the validity of s. 515(6)(d).

 

                   (ii) Whether
Section 515(6)(d) Denies Bail

 

                   In order to
determine whether s. 515(6)(d) infringes s. 11(e), it is first
necessary to determine whether s. 515(6)(d) even has the effect of
denying bail.  The appellant and the intervening Attorneys General submit that
s. 515(6)(d) does not deny bail because it merely requires the accused
to show that detention is not justified in the circumstances of the case.  With
respect, I cannot agree.

 

                   Section 515(6)(d)
is an exception to the basic entitlement to bail contained in s. 11(e). 
Instead of requiring the prosecution to show that pre-trial detention is
justified, it requires the accused to show that pre-trial detention is not
justified.   In my view, the mere fact that there is a departure from the basic
entitlement to bail is sufficient to conclude that there is a denial of bail
for the purposes of s. 11(e) and that this denial of bail must be with
""just cause"" in order to be constitutionally justified.  Furthermore,
the very wording of s. 515(6)(d) establishes that it has the effect of
denying bail in certain circumstances.  Section 515(6)(d) provides that
under certain circumstances ""the justice shall order that the accused be
detained in custody"".  This wording mandates a denial of bail.  Such
wording makes it impossible to accept the submission that s. 515(6)(d)
does not constitute a denial of bail.

 

                   Given that s.
515(6)(d) denies bail in certain circumstances, it becomes necessary to
determine whether there is just cause for this denial.  

 

                   (iii)  Whether
Section 515(6)(d) Provides Just Cause to Deny Bail

 

                   Although s. 515(6)(d)
constitutes a denial of bail in certain circumstances, in my opinion there is
just cause for this denial of bail.  There are two reasons for my conclusion. 
First, bail is denied only in a narrow set of circumstances.  Second, the
denial of bail is necessary to promote the proper functioning of the bail
system and is not undertaken for any purpose extraneous to the bail system. 
The effect of s. 515(6)(d) is to establish a set of special bail rules
in circumstances where the normal bail process is incapable of functioning
properly.  In my view, there is just cause for these special rules.

 

                   The circumstances
in which bail is denied under s. 515(6)(d) are very narrow.  Section
515(6)(d) applies only to a very small number of offences, all of which
involve the distribution of narcotics.  Furthermore, s. 515(6)(d) does
not deny bail for all persons who are charged with these offences, but rather
denies bail only when these persons are unable to demonstrate that detention is
not justified having regard to the specified primary or secondary grounds.  The
narrow scope of the denial of bail under s. 515(6)(d) is essential to
its validity under s. 11(e).  The basic entitlement of s. 11(e)
cannot be denied in a broad or sweeping exception.

 

                   The offences which
are included under s. 515(6)(d) have specific characteristics which
justify differential treatment in the bail process.  These characteristics are
noted by the Groupe de travail sur la lutte contre la drogue, Rapport du
groupe de travail sur la lutte contre la drogue (1990).  It notes at pp.
18-19 that drug trafficking generally constitutes a form of organized crime:

 

[translation]  In Quebec drug
trafficking is generally under the control of members of organized crime,
who are responsible for distribution in all areas.  Using well‑organized
networks, their capacity to finance major deals allows them to import large
quantities of drugs, often even using legitimate businesses as a cover.  For
some time they have invested and pooled their resources to optimize the
financial return on their investments:  these cartels go so far as to plan a
type of risk insurance which allows them to distribute losses suffered in
police raids among themselves.  Acting as importers, wholesalers and retailers
at the same time, the organizations can sell by the tonne, by the kilo and even
by the gram through outlets controlled by them; they are particularly active in
cannabis and heroin trafficking.  The traffickers in this category are of
various origins, but since 1985 arrests of foreign nationals who maintain ties
with producing countries have become more frequent.  These international
ramifications enable organized crime to be active in both the producing and
consuming countries and in this regard one cannot ignore the existence of links
between the Montreal Mafia and the criminal elements in certain South American
countries.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

It also notes at p. 21 that the nature
of drug trafficking is sometimes mistakenly viewed as less serious than more
openly violent crimes:

 

[translation]  Unlike robbery,
sexual assault and murder, drug trafficking is often wrongly regarded as a non‑violent
crime:  there is accordingly a certain tolerance of traffickers who give
the illusion of being anonymous businessmen, hidden among those who are engaged
in lawful business.  Such an impression is far from the reality, however, when
one considers the fierce battles for control of territory and violent action to
obtain the money needed to purchase drugs; equally, when one thinks of the
personal brutality and social dramas that result.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

It notes at p. 24 that narcotics
offences increase the general level of criminality:

 

[translation]  Drugs are
responsible for 70 to 80% of prison terms:  crimes resulting from the
application of narcotics legislation (possession and trafficking); crimes
committed under the influence of alcohol or other drugs (rape, violence and
homicide); crimes committed to obtain drugs (theft and prostitution).

 

                   The unique
characteristics of the offences subject to s. 515(6)(d) suggest that
those offences are committed in a very different context than most other crimes. 
Most offences are not committed systematically.  By contrast, trafficking in
narcotics occurs systematically, usually within a highly sophisticated
commercial setting.  It is often a business and a way of life.  It is highly
lucrative, creating huge incentives for an offender to continue criminal
behaviour even after arrest and release on bail.  In these circumstances, the
normal process of arrest and bail will normally not be effective in bringing an
end to criminal behaviour.  Special bail rules are required in order to
establish a bail system which maintains the accused's right to pre-trial
release while discouraging continuing criminal activity.

 

                   Another specific
feature of the offences subject to s. 515(6)(d) is that there is a
marked danger that an accused charged with these offences will abscond rather
than appear for trial.  Ensuring the appearance of the accused at trial is the
primary purpose of any system of pre-trial release, and the system must be
structured to minimize the risk that an accused will abscond rather than face
trial.  For most offences, the risk that an accused will abscond rather than
face trial is minimal.  It is not an easy thing to abscond from justice.  The
accused must remain a fugitive from justice for the rest of his or her
lifetime.  The accused must flee to a country which does not have an
extradition treaty with Canada (or whose extradition treaty does not cover the
specific offence which the accused is alleged to have committed).
Alternatively, the accused must remain in hiding.  Either prospect is costly. 
Neither prospect is possible unless the accused is exceedingly wealthy or part
of a sophisticated organization which can assist in the difficult task of
absconding.  Most alleged offenders are neither wealthy nor members of
sophisticated organizations.  Drug importers and traffickers, however, have
access both to a large amount of funds and to sophisticated organizations which
can assist in a flight from justice.  These offenders accordingly pose a
significant risk that they will abscond rather than face trial.

 

                   There appears to be
no evidence about the risk of absconding by those charged with narcotics
offences in Canada.  However, there is evidence from both the United States and
Australia which demonstrates that those charged with narcotics offences pose a
particular danger of absconding while on bail.  In the United States, the
United States Senate, Report of the Committee on the Judiciary on the
Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1983 (1983), refers at p. 20 to the
problem of drug offenders absconding while on bail:

 

Furthermore,
the Committee received testimony that flight to avoid prosecution is
particularly high among persons charged with major drug offenses.  Because of
the extremely lucrative nature of drug trafficking, and the fact that drug
traffickers often have established substantial ties outside the United States
from whence most dangerous drugs are imported into the country, these persons
have both the resources and foreign contacts to escape to other countries with
relative ease in order to avoid prosecution for offenses punishable by lengthy
prison sentences.  Even the prospect of forfeiture of bond in the hundreds of
thousands of dollars has proven to be ineffective in assuring the appearance of
major drug traffickers.  [Footnote omitted.]

 

In Australia, the Hon. Mr. Justice E.
S. Williams, Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs (1980),
refers to this risk at p. B222:

 

                   Police
witnesses from a number of States indicated that their efforts in drug law
enforcement were often frustrated by persons charged with offences absconding
while on bail.  It was frequently pointed out that experience has shown that
there were proportionally more abscondences from bail by persons charged with
serious drug offences than with any other type of crime, and that the amounts
of bail and/or sureties set by the courts were often grossly inadequate in
comparison with the financial rewards available from large-scale drug dealing.

 

Of course these sources do not provide
direct evidence of the situation in Canada, and no Attorney General has
tendered any evidence either in this Court or in the courts below.  However, in
view of the international interconnection of the drug trade and the fact that
the United States and Australia are two societies which are very similar to our
own, evidence from those societies provides a reasonable basis for concluding
that serious narcotics offences create specific difficulties for the bail
process.

 

                   In the Court of
Appeal, Proulx J.A. expressed concern about the scope of s. 515(6)(d). 
He felt that it is inequitable to treat a person who distributes a few joints
of marijuana in the same manner as a person running a sophisticated network to
traffic cocaine.  Proulx J.A.'s concerns are legitimate.  The scope of the Narcotic
Control Act is very broad.  The schedule to the Narcotic Control Act,
which lists the substances defined as ""narcotics"", includes both hard
and soft drugs.  Furthermore, ""trafficking"" is a very broad concept. 
Under s. 2 of the Narcotic Control Act, ""traffic"" means
""to manufacture, sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute""
a narcotic, or to offer to do any of those items.  The offence of trafficking
can even be committed by giving a narcotic to a friend for safekeeping: see R.
v. Lauze (1980), 17 C.R. (3d) 90 (Que. C.A.).  Thus s. 515(6)(d)
applies not only to hardened drug traffickers, but also to ""small
fry"" drug dealers and even to the ""generous smoker"" who shares a
single joint of marijuana at a party.

 

                   Although I believe
that Proulx J.A.'s concerns about the scope of s. 515(6)(d) are
legitimate, in my view they do not lead to a conclusion that s. 515(6)(d)
violates s. 11(e).  The ""small fry"" and ""generous
smoker"" will normally have no difficulty justifying their release and
obtaining bail.  This is not a situation like that in R. v. Smith,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, where an overbroad provision did not allow differential
treatment based on the seriousness of the offence.  Indeed all guilty accused
had to be sentenced to at least 7 years imprisonment.  Section 515(6)(d)
does not mandate denial of bail in all cases and therefore does allow
differential treatment based on the seriousness of the offence.  Moreover, the
onus which it imposes is reasonable in the sense that it requires the accused
to provide information which he or she is most capable of providing.  If a person
accused of trafficking or importing is ""small fry"" or a
""generous smoker"", then the accused is in the best position to
demonstrate at a bail hearing that he or she is not part of a criminal
organization engaged in distributing narcotics.

 

                   The very specific
characteristics of the offences subject to s. 515(6)(d) suggest that the
special bail rules created by s. 515(6)(d) are necessary to create a
bail system which will not be subverted by continuing criminal activity and by
absconding accused.  The offences subject to s. 515(6)(d) are undertaken
in contexts in which criminal activity will tend to continue after arrest and
bail, and they create the circumstances under which offenders are able to
abscond rather than face trial.  The special bail rules in s. 515(6)(d)
combat these problems by requiring the accused to demonstrate that these
problems will not arise.

 

                   The special bail
rules in s. 515(6)(d) do not have any purpose extraneous to the bail
system, but rather merely establish an effective bail system for specific
offences for which the normal bail system would allow continuing criminal
behaviour and an intolerable risk of absconding.  The scope of these special
rules is narrow and carefully tailored to achieve a properly functioning bail
system.  I therefore conclude that there is just cause for s. 515(6)(d)
to depart from the basic entitlement of s. 11(e) and to deny bail in
certain circumstances.  Accordingly, I conclude that s. 515(6)(d) does
not violate s. 11(e).

 

                   (3)  Section 9 

 

                   The respondent's
submission that s. 515(6)(d) violates s. 9  of the Charter  can be
dealt with very briefly.  There is no question that s. 515(6) (d)
provides for persons to be ""detained"" within the meaning of s. 9  of
the Charter .  The sole issue is to determine whether those persons are
detained ""arbitrarily"".  Le Dain J. discussed the meaning of
""arbitrarily"" in R. v. Hufsky, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 621.  He held
at p. 633 that a random police spot check of motor vehicles constituted
arbitrary detention under s. 9  because ""[t]he selection was in the
absolute discretion of the police officer.  A discretion is arbitrary if there
are no criteria, express or implied, which govern its exercise.""  Thus
detention is arbitrary if it is governed by unstructured discretion.

 

                   In my view, detention
under s. 515(6)(d) is not arbitrary in this sense.  Section 515(6)(d)
sets out a process with fixed standards.  This process is in no way
discretionary.  Specific conditions for bail are set out.  The highly
structured nature of the criterion in s. 515(6)(d) is in sharp contrast
to the completely random nature of the detention which was held to violate s. 9 
in Hufsky, R. v. Ladouceur, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1257, and R. v.
Wilson, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1291.  Furthermore, the bail process is subject to
very exacting procedural guarantees (see ss. 516, 518(1)(b), 523(2) (b))
and subject to review by a superior court (see ss. 520  and 521 ).  

 

                   Accordingly, I
conclude that s. 515(6)(d) does not violate s. 9 .

 

                   (4) 
Section 1 

 

                   The parties and
interveners have made extensive submissions about the application of s. 1 . 
Given that I have found no violation of ss. 7 , 9 , 11 (d) or 11(e),
it is not necessary to consider s. 1 , as the second constitutional question
does not arise.

 

                   I find that s.
515(6)(d) does not offend ss. 7 , 11 (d), 11 (e) or 9  of the Charter 
in as much as it requires the respondent, in the circumstances specified in s.
515(6) (d), to show cause why his detention is not justified.  The appeal
is allowed, the order of the Court of Appeal is set aside and the application
for the writ of habeas corpus is dismissed.

 

                   However, in the
case of R. v. Morales, supra, the judgment in which is being
released simultaneously with the judgment in this case, the Court has decided
that the inclusion in s. 515(10) (b) of the Criminal Code  of the
words ""in the public interest or"" infringes s. 11 (e) of the Charter 
and those words are declared to be of no force or effect.  To this extent,
there has been a change in the secondary ground for detention and therefore a
change with respect to one of the grounds in relation to which the respondent
pursuant to s. 515(6) (d) was required to show cause why his detention
was not justified.  Therefore, although the appellant's appeal succeeds with
respect to s. 515(6) (d), normally an order under s. 686(8)  of the Criminal
Code  would have been issued and the respondent, pursuant to the decision in
Morales, would have had a new bail hearing at which time he would have
been given a reasonable opportunity to show cause why his detention is not justified
having regard to the grounds set out in ss. 515(10) (a) and (b) as
altered by the Court's decision in Morales.  However, as the respondent
has since been tried, convicted and sentenced, that order would be of no force
or effect as the issue of the respondent's liberty is moot.

 

VI - Disposition

 

                   Habeas corpus is available in the narrow
circumstances of this case.  The appellant's first ground of appeal accordingly
fails.  Section 515(6) (d) of the Criminal Code  does not violate
ss. 7 , 9 , or 11 (d) of the Charter .  Placing the onus on the
accused to show cause why his detention is not justified in the circumstances
set out in s. 515(6) (d) does not violate s. 11 (e) of the Charter . 
The appellant's second ground of appeal accordingly succeeds.  As a result, the
appeal should be allowed and the application for habeas corpus
dismissed.  As decided in Morales, one aspect of the secondary ground
for detention with respect to which the accused had the burden is of no force
or effect.  But, for the reasons given previously, there shall be no order for
a new bail hearing.  The constitutional questions are answered as follows:

 

1.Does
s. 515(6)(d) of the Criminal Code  of Canada limit the rights
guaranteed in ss. 7 , 9 , 11 (d) and 11 (e) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer:With
respect to ss. 7 , 9  and 11 (d), the answer is no.  With respect to s. 11 (e),
the answer is yes, but only to the extent that the section has reference to
that part of s. 515(10) (b) which has been held by this Court in R. v.
Morales (judgment rendered this day) to be of no force or effect.

 

2.If
so, is s. 515(6) (d) of the Criminal Code  of Canada a reasonable
limit prescribed by law that can be demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society, as required by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms ?

 

Answer:This
question does not arise.

 

//La Forest J.//

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   La
Forest J. (dissenting) --
I agree with Justice McLachlin, for the reasons she gives, that s. 515(6) (d)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , violates s. 11 (e) of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and is not saved by s. 1 . 
For these reasons, I would dispose of the appeal as she proposes, and
accordingly find it unnecessary to deal with the other provisions of the Charter .

 

//Gonthier J.//

 

                   The reasons of
L'Heureux-Dubé and Gonthier JJ. were delivered by

                   Gonthier
J. -- I am in agreement
with the reasons of the Chief Justice, subject however to my reasons in the
case of R. v. Morales, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 000, in which I conclude that the
criterion of public interest in s. 515(10) (b) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , is not unconstitutional.  I also have some
concerns about the manner in which the presumption of innocence, as an integral
value protected by s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ,
is dealt with by the Chief Justice in relation to the bail provisions of the Criminal
Code .  In my view, the analysis leading to the decision as to bail entails
a consideration and weighing of the accused's entitlement to bail or liberty
interest on the one hand, and the circumstances provided for in s. 515(10) 
which may justify a denial of bail on the other.  The liberty interest is but
one albeit an important factor to be considered but may be outweighed by
others.

 

                   Consequently, I
would allow the appeal on the second ground and dismiss the application for habeas
corpus.  The constitutional questions are answered as follows:

 

1.Does
s. 515(6)(d) of the Criminal Code  of Canada limit the rights
guaranteed in ss. 7 , 9 , 11 (d) and 11 (e) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

                   Answer:  No.

 

2.If
so, is s. 515(6) (d) of the Criminal Code  of Canada a
reasonable limit prescribed by law that can be demonstrably justified in a free
and democratic society, as required by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms ?

 

                   Answer:   This
question does not arise.

 

//McLachlin J.//

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   McLachlin
J. (dissenting) -- I have
had the advantage of reading the reasons of the Chief Justice.  I agree with
them, save for his conclusion that s. 515(6) (d) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , does not violate the constitutional right ""not to
be denied reasonable bail without just cause"" guaranteed by s. 11 (e)
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  I share the Court of
Appeal's concern that s. 515(6) (d) fails to distinguish between the
large-scale commercial drug trafficker and the ""small-time"" drug
trafficker.  Were s. 515(6)(d) confined to the large-scale organized
trafficker, there might be just cause for denying bail to people in this
group.  As the section stands, however, it can be used to deny bail to people
when there is no reason or ""just cause"" for denying them bail.  And
where bail is denied without just cause, s. 11 (e) of the Charter 
is infringed on its plain words.

 

                   Section 515(6)(d)
denies bail to all persons charged with having committed an offence under s. 4
or 5 of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. N-1, or the offence
of conspiring to commit such an offence, who cannot show cause why their
detention in custody is not justified.  The denial of bail in certain
circumstances, as Lamer C.J. points out in his reasons at p. 000, ""makes it
impossible to accept the submission that s. 515(6)(d) does not
constitute a denial of bail.""  Thus, the fact that the section merely
raises the possibility of denial of bail, as opposed to mandating bail denial,
does not in itself cure the unconstitutionality of the section.  The mere
possibility of denial of bail ""without just cause"" is enough to
overturn this section. 

 

                   As the Chief
Justice acknowledges, the section is very broad.  First, it applies to everyone
who commits the specified offences.  Second, the offences are very broad.  They
catch anyone who ""traffics"" in a drug, however small the quantity or
whatever the circumstances.  And ""trafficking"" itself is a very broad
concept.  As a result, s. 515(6)(d) catches not only large-scale drug
dealers, but the friend who shares a joint of marijuana at a party or gives it
to a friend for safekeeping. All trafficking is repugnant and hence criminally
punishable.  But when the issue is denial of bail, the different dangers
associated with the different types of trafficking, may require different
treatment.

 

                   I agree with my
colleague that there may be ""just cause"" for denying bail to persons
charged with serious, large-scale or commercial trafficking.  With the greatest
respect, however, it seems to me that the reasons he gives for this conclusion
do not apply to other traffickers.  The reasons he gives are two.  First, the
trafficker is said to be more likely than persons charged with other offences
to continue his or her criminal behaviour in the interval before trial if he or
she is released.  Second, the trafficker is said to be more likely than persons
charged with other offences to abscond and fail to appear at trial. 

 

                   These distinctions
apply only to one category of persons caught by s. 515(6)(d) -- the
organized commercial trafficker.  Let us look first at the argument that the
trafficker is more likely than those charged with other offences to continue
criminal activity while awaiting trial.  My colleague supports this conclusion
with the following observations (at p. 000):

 

Most
offences are not committed systematically.  By contrast, trafficking in
narcotics occurs systematically, usually within a highly sophisticated
commercial setting. . . . It is highly lucrative, creating huge incentives for
an offender to continue criminal behaviour even after arrest and release on
bail.

 

These comments are applicable to a
person involved in organized commercial drug trafficking.  They do not apply to
others.  Much trafficking has nothing to do with profit or making money. 
Profit is not a required element of the offence: see R. v. Drysdelle
(1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d) 238 (N.B.C.A.).  Nor is promotion of future distribution
required: see R. v. Larson (1972), 6 C.C.C. (2d) 145 (B.C.C.A.).  The
amounts involved may be minuscule; no money need change hands.  In short, the
""small-time"" trafficker may not be motivated by money or profit, nor
be a participant in a ""highly sophisticated commercial setting"".  The
argument advanced by my colleague does not apply to him or her.

 

                   The second argument
is that there is a ""marked danger"" that an accused charged with the
offence of trafficking will abscond and not appear for trial.  My colleague
supports this conclusion as follows (at p. 000):

 

Drug
importers and traffickers . . . have access both to a large amount of funds and
to sophisticated organizations which can assist in a flight from justice. 
These offenders accordingly pose a significant risk that they will abscond
rather than face trial.

 

Again, the same problem arises.  Not
all accused denied bail under s. 515(6)(d) fall into the category of
prosperous drug lords; not all have international organizations willing to help
them escape the country.  The casual user who gives a joint to a friend
provides an obvious example.  But even in the commercial drug world, it is far
from clear that those charged with trafficking are more able to abscond than
people charged with other offences.  Those charged with trafficking are often
at the bottom of the chain and rarely provide a link to the top.  Professor
Carrigan in Crime and Punishment in Canada: A History (1991),  relying
on an RCMP report, National Drug Intelligence Estimate 1987/88, states
(at p. 196):

 

                   Drug
trade links are intricate and difficult for the police to penetrate.  At the
top of the chain are international syndicates that buy the raw product and
arrange for processing and transportation.  Supplies are delivered to gangs
across the country, which in turn have a network of street vendors.  The latter
sometimes get caught, but it has proven extremely difficult to reach the
management level of the chain and to intercept the flow of drugs.

 

Thus it is far from apparent that the
majority of those arrested for organized drug trafficking have large amounts of
money or organizations which will assist them in escaping.  The lowly street
vendor, the person most likely to be arrested, cannot count on the distant drug
lord to run the risk of stealing him out of the country.

 

                   My colleague cites
American and Australian studies, at pp. 000 and 000 of his reasons, to support
the conclusion that flight is a major problem among those charged with
trafficking in drugs.  However, the conclusions relied on in those studies are
confined to ""major"", ""serious"" and ""large-scale""
drug dealing.

 

                   The United States
Senate, Report of the Committee on the Judiciary on the Comprehensive Crime
Control Act of 1983 (1983) states that:

 

. .
. flight to avoid prosecution is particularly high among persons charged with major
drug offenses. . . . Even the prospect of forfeiture of bond in the
hundreds of thousands of dollars has proven to be ineffective in assuring the
appearance of major drug traffickers.  [Emphasis added.]

 

An Australian Royal Commission Report contained
similar findings:

 

It
was frequently pointed out that experience has shown that there were
proportionally more abscondences from bail by persons charged with serious
drug offences than with any other type of crime, and that the amounts of
bail and/or sureties set by the courts were often grossly inadequate in
comparison with the financial rewards available from large-scale drug
dealing.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   In fact, the law of
the United States and Australia, unlike that of Canada, distinguishes between
major and more minor trafficking.  In the United States, the Anti-Drug Abuse
Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-570, 100 Stat. 3207 (1986), and the Anti-Drug
Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-690, 102 Stat. 4181 (1988), passed after
the Report of the Judiciary Committee, target major drug traffickers by
classifying federal drug trafficking crimes on the basis of quantity.   The
equivalent Australian Commonwealth legislation also classifies crimes on the
basis of ""trafficable quantity"" (e.g., 2 grams of cocaine) versus
""commercial quantity"" (e.g., 2 kg  of cocaine).  In Canada, by
contrast, all trafficking is lumped together.  It is incorrect, with respect,
to apply conclusions based on major drug offences in the United States and
Australia, to all types of trafficking, major and minor, in Canada.

 

                   I conclude that
whatever legitimacy the arguments of repeat offences and fleeing bail may have
with respect the higher, more organized levels of drug trafficking, they offer
no reason for denying bail to the many other traffickers who fall under s.
515(6)(d).

 

                   My colleague
responds to these concerns, eloquently expressed by Proulx J.A. in the Court of
Appeal below,  with a final argument: the people for whom there are no special
reasons for pre-trial detention will be able to convince the judge that they
are not in fact part of an organization and hence bail will not in fact be
unjustly denied.  Such offenders, he states, at p. 000,

 

. .
. will normally have no difficulty justifying their release and obtaining bail.
. . .  If a person accused of trafficking or importing is a ""small
fry"" or a ""generous smoker"", then the accused is in the best
position to demonstrate at a bail hearing that he or she is not part of a
criminal organization engaged in distributing narcotics.

 

                   The first
difficulty with this proposition is that it is far from clear that a person
charged with a more minor trafficking offence will be able to convince the
judge that he or she is not connected to a drug organization.  The argument
would require the accused, presumed to be innocent, to prove the negative
proposition that he or she is not part of a criminal organization.  Criminal
organizations, unlike unions and service organizations, do not distribute lists
of their members. How does one prove that one is not a member?

 

                   Second, the
argument does not address the difficulty of the lower-level agent of a larger
commercial trafficking organization.  The street vendor, while criminally
responsible,  may not pose a special risk of pre-trial recidivism or
absconding.  Yet he or she may be unable to establish that they are in no way
connected to organized crime.  There is no just cause for denying bail in such
a case, yet bail might well be denied on the criteria proposed by my colleague.

 

                   In summary, it
seems clear to me, despite the arguments to the contrary, that s. 515(6)(d)
may well result in denying people bail in the absence of ""just
cause"".  Section 11 (e) of the Charter  says everyone has the
right not to be denied bail without just cause.  It follows of necessity that
s. 515(6) (d) violates s. 11 (e) of the Charter .

 

                   If s. 515(6)(d)
violates s. 11 (e) of the Charter , it must be struck down under s.
1  and s. 52  of the Constitution Act, 1982  unless the Crown establishes
that it is ""demonstrably justified"" in a free and democratic
society.  To meet this test a law must be directed to an objective of
compelling importance and must not exceed what is necessary to achieve that
objective.  I take as given that s. 515(6) (d) is directed to avoiding
repeat offences and absconding.  These are important objectives.  The problem
is that s. 515(6) (d) goes further than is necessary to achieve those
objectives.  As discussed, there is no reason to conclude that small and casual
traffickers pose any particular threat of repeating the offence or fleeing from
their trial. Thus violating their constitutional right to bail in the absence
of ""just cause"" does nothing to promote the objectives of the
section.  Other jurisdictions, like the United States and Australia,
distinguish between major and minor trafficking.  Canada, for no apparent
reason, does not.  One may hope that Parliament will revisit the question and
consider confining denial of bail to cases where it can be justified.  For the
present, however, I agree with the Court of Appeal that s. 515(6) (d)
cannot be justified and accordingly is of no force and effect under s. 52  of
the Constitution Act, 1982 .

 

                   Consequently, I
would dismiss the appeal.  The constitutional questions are answered as
follows:

 

1.Does
s. 515(6)(d) of the Criminal Code  of Canada limit the rights
guaranteed in ss. 7 , 9  11(d) and 11(e) of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

                   Answer:With
respect to ss. 7 , 9  and 11 (d), the answer is no.  With respect to s. 11 (e),
the answer is yes.

 

2.If
so, is s. 515(6) (d) of the Criminal Code  of Canada a reasonable
limit prescribed by law that can be demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society, as required by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms ?

 

                   Answer:No.

                   The accused was
charged with narcotics offences under ss. 4 and 5 of the Narcotic
Control Act and s. 465(1) (c) of the Criminal Code .  He
is alleged to have participated in a major network to import cocaine into
Canada.  At the time of his arrest, he was awaiting trial for assault with a
weapon, an indictable offence.  The accused was denied bail and was ordered
detained in custody until trial.  Under the bail provisions of the Criminal
Code , an accused is normally granted bail but pre‑trial detention is
justified when the ""detention is necessary in the public interest or for
the protection or safety of the public, having regard to all the circumstances
including any substantial likelihood that the accused will, if he is released
from custody, commit a criminal offence or interfere with the administration of
justice"" (s. 515(10) (b)).  Under s. 515(6), the onus is
on the accused to show cause why the detention is not justified when he is
charged with an indictable offence ""that is alleged to have been committed
while he was at large after being released in respect of another indictable
offence"" (s. 515(6) (a)), or charged with having committed a
drug offence under s. 4 or 5 of the Narcotic Control Act or with
conspiracy to commit any of these offences (s. 515(6) (d)).  The
accused's application for a review of the detention order, made to a superior
court judge pursuant to s. 520 of the Code, was granted and he was
released subject to a number of conditions.  The judge held that pre‑trial
detention is only justified where it is established that the accused will not
appear for trial or would represent a danger to public safety if released.  The
Crown appealed to this Court.  This appeal is to determine whether
ss. 515(6) (a), 515(6) (d) and 515(10) (b) of the Criminal
Code  infringe ss. 7 , 9 , 11 (d) or 11 (e) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ; and, if so, whether the infringement is
justified under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
allowed.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
Sopinka, McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ.:  For the reasons given in Pearson,
the ""public safety"" component of s. 515(10) (b) is
constitutionally valid.  Section 11 (d) of the Charter  creates a
procedural and evidentiary rule which operates at the trial requiring the
prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.  It
has no application at the bail stage where guilt or innocence is not determined
and where punishment is not imposed.  The ""public safety"" component
of s. 515(10) (b) therefore does not infringe s. 11 (d). 
With respect to s. 7  of the Charter , the accused's challenge should
be determined under s. 11 (e) of the Charter  because that
section offers a highly specific guarantee which covers precisely his claim. 
The presumption of innocence is a principle of fundamental justice which
applies at all stages of the criminal process, but its procedural requirements
at the bail stage are satisfied whenever the requirements of s. 11 (e)
are satisfied.  This section creates a basic entitlement to be granted
reasonable bail unless there is ""just cause"" to do otherwise.  There
is just cause to deny bail under s. 11 (e) if two criteria are met: 
the denial of bail must occur only in a narrow set of circumstances, and the
denial of bail must be necessary to promote the proper functioning of the bail
system and must not be undertaken for any purpose extraneous to the bail
system.  The ""public safety"" component of s. 515(10) (b)
meets these criteria.  First, bail is denied only for those who pose a
""substantial likelihood"" of committing an offence or interfering with
the administration of justice, and only where this ""substantial
likelihood"" endangers ""the protection or safety of the public"". 
Moreover, detention is justified only when it is ""necessary"" for
public safety.  Second, the bail system does not function properly if an
accused interferes with the administration of justice or commits crimes while
on bail.  While it is impossible to make exact predictions about recidivism and
future dangerousness, exact predictability of future dangerousness is not
constitutionally mandated.  It is sufficient that the bail system establish a
likelihood of dangerousness.  The bail provisions of the Code also provide
for substantial procedural safeguards against the inefficacy of predictions
about dangerousness.  Finally, with respect to s. 9  of the Charter ,
while the ""public safety"" component of s. 515(10) (b)
provides for persons to be ""detained"" within the meaning of
s. 9 , those persons are not detained ""arbitrarily"".  Detention
under the ""public safety"" component of s. 515(10) (b) is
not governed by unstructured discretion.  The ""public safety""
component sets out a process with fixed standards and sets specific conditions
for bail.  Furthermore, the bail process is subject to very exacting procedural
guarantees.  It follows that the ""public safety"" component of
s. 515(10) (b) does not violate s. 9 .

 

                   The ""public
interest"" component as a basis for pre‑trial detention under
s. 515(10) (b) violates s. 11 (e) of the Charter ,
however, because it authorizes detention in terms which are vague and imprecise
and thus authorizes a denial of bail without just cause.  The term ""public
interest"", as currently defined by the courts, is incapable of framing the
legal debate in any meaningful manner or structuring discretion in any way. 
Nor would it be possible to give that term a constant or settled meaning.  The
term gives the courts unrestricted latitude to define any circumstances as
sufficient to justify pre‑trial detention but creates no criteria for
defining these circumstances.  No amount of judicial interpretation of the term
""public interest"" would be capable of rendering it a provision which
gives any guidance for legal debate.  Such unfettered discretion violates the
doctrine of vagueness.  This doctrine applies to all types of enactments and is
not restricted to provisions which define an offence or prohibit certain
conduct.  The principles of fundamental justice preclude a standardless sweep
in any provision which authorizes imprisonment.  A standardless sweep does not
become acceptable simply because it results from the discretion of judges and
justices of the peace rather than the discretion of law enforcement officials.

 

                   The violation of
s. 11 (e) is not justified under s. 1  of the Charter . 
Even if the term ""public interest"" is not too vague to constitute a
limit ""prescribed by law"", it cannot be justified under the Oakes
test.  While the objectives of preventing crime and preventing interference
with the administration of justice by those who are on bail are of sufficient
importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right, the
""public interest"" component of s. 515(10) (b) does not
meet the proportionality test.  There is no rational connection between the
measure and the objectives.  The provision is so vague that it does not provide
any means to determine which accused are most likely to commit offences or
interfere with the administration of justice while on bail.  It accordingly
authorizes pre‑trial detention in many cases which are not related to the
objectives of the measure.  Further, the measure does not impair rights as
little as possible.  The vague and overbroad concept of public interest permits
far more pre‑trial detention than is required to meet the objectives.
Finally, there is no proportionality between the effects of the measure and its
objectives.  By authorizing excessive pre‑trial detention, the effects of
the limit far exceed the objectives of the measure.  The ""public
interest"" component of s. 515(10) (b) is thus
unconstitutional.  The offending words, specifically ""in the public
interest or"", are severable and should be struck down pursuant to
s. 52  of the Constitution Act, 1982 .  The criteria of ""public
interest"" and ""public safety"" in s. 515(10) (b) are
disjunctive and striking down the specific offending provision does not defeat
the unitary scheme envisaged by Parliament.  The balance of the provision can
stand as a functioning whole.

 

                   In light of Pearson, 
s. 515(6)(d) of the Code, to the extent that it requires the
accused to show cause why detention is not justified, does not violate
ss. 7 , 9 , 11 (d) or 11 (e) of the Charter .

 

                   This conclusion is
also applicable to s. 515(6)(a) of the Code.  Since
s. 11(d) of the Charter  is not applicable at the bail stage,
s. 515(6) (a) therefore does not infringe s. 11 (d). With
respect to s. 7  of the Charter , the accused's case should be
analysed under s. 11 (e) rather than the more general provisions of
s. 7 .  While s. 515(6)(a) requires the accused to demonstrate
that detention is not justified, thereby denying the basic entitlement under
s. 11 (e) to be granted bail unless pre‑trial detention is
justified by the prosecution, s. 515(6) (a) provides just cause to
deny bail.  First, the denial of bail occurs only in a narrow set of
circumstances.  Section 515(6) (a) applies only to indictable offences
and denies bail only when the persons who have been charged with an indictable
offence while on bail for another indictable offence do not show cause why
detention is not justified.  Second, the denial of bail is necessary to promote
the proper functioning of the bail system.  The special bail rules in
s. 515(6) (a) do not have any purpose extraneous to the bail system,
but rather merely establish an effective bail system in circumstances where
there are reasonable grounds to believe that the normal bail system is
permitting continuing criminal behaviour.  By requiring the accused to justify
bail, s. 515(6) (a) seeks to ensure that the objective of stopping
criminal behaviour will be achieved.  The scope of these special rules is thus
carefully tailored to achieve a properly functioning bail system.  With respect
to s. 9  of the Charter ,  s. 515(6) (a) does not provide
for ""arbitrary"" detention.  Like s. 515(6)(d),
s. 515(6)(a) sets out a process which is not discretionary and
which is subject to fixed standards.  Section 515(6) (a) contains highly
structured criteria and sets out specific conditions for bail.  In addition,
the bail process is subject to very exacting procedural guarantees and subject
to review by a superior court.

 

                     The Superior
Court did not err in holding that pre‑trial detention is only justified
where it is established that the accused will not appear for trial or would
represent a danger to public safety if released.  These two grounds are the
only grounds specified in s. 515(10)  which survive Charter 
challenge.  However, the Superior Court did err in refusing to apply the
procedure mandated by ss. 515(6) (a) and 515(6) (d), both of
which are constitutionally valid.  As a result, the matter must be remitted to
the Superior Court for a new bail review under s. 520  in which
ss. 515(6) (a) and 515(6) (d) are applied and s. 515(10) (b)
is applied after severance of the words ""in the public interest or"".

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé and
Gonthier JJ.: The reasons of Lamer C.J. were agreed with, except for
his finding that the criterion of ""public interest"" in
s. 515(10)(b) of the Code is unconstitutional on grounds of
vagueness. Public interest, as referred to in s. 515(10) (b), falls
within the purview of the concept of ""just cause"" in s. 11 (e)
of the Charter  and is intended to be one particularization of just
cause.  It is thus in terms of the entire concept that the meaning of public
interest must be understood.  The evaluation and elaboration of a ""public
interest"" criterion must also proceed with reference to the particular
context in which it is to operate.  The identification of a measure of
discretion conferred by means of a legislative provision cannot alone provide
the basis for a constitutional evaluation of that provision.

 

                     The general sense
of the phrase ""public interest"" refers to the special set of values
which are best understood from the point of view of the aggregate good and are
of relevance to matters relating to the well‑being of society.  Public
interest is at the heart of our legal system and inspires all legislation as
well as the administration of justice.  The breadth of the concept is a
necessary aspect of a notion which accommodates a host of important
considerations which permit the law to serve a necessarily wide variety of
public goals.  At the same time, the notion of public interest operates as a
reference for the rules of law which bear upon legal determinations of when the
interest of the public will be specially considered, the relationship which
those interests will have to other interests which fall to be considered, and
the extent to which the public interest is to be protected by the law.

 

                   A bail application
does not involve a finding of guilt as to past conduct.  It is rather concerned
with governing future conduct during the interim period awaiting trial.  What
is at issue are the reasons for detention.  The criterion set by the Charter 
is that of just cause.  This implies (1) a cause or reason and (2) a
proportionality between the reason and the deprivation of liberty that makes
the cause ""just"".  Public interest, as used in s. 515(10) , must
be understood in this context and considered in relation to two main elements: 
the element of necessity, which involves a causal link between the public
interest and the detention such as to make the detention necessary and not
merely convenient or desirable and which is also an element of importance,
weight or seriousness of the public interest such as to outweigh the accused's
right to personal liberty; and the element of seriousness of the public
interest, which serves to qualify the other element, namely the content of the
considerations that may be included within the public interest criterion.  The
considerations to be weighed in determining the public interest are those which
are consistent with the safeguarding of the fundamental values of the rule of
law and the Charter , including the maintenance of order and security and
a respect for the fundamental individual and collective rights of others.  Also
important is the consideration that the criterion of necessity is capable of
encompassing circumstances which have not been foreseen, or are unforeseeable,
but which undoubtedly provide just cause for denying bail within the meaning of
s. 11 (e) of the Charter .  Public interest, as used in
s. 515(10) , thus provides for flexibility, not vagueness.  Its dual
requirements of public interest and necessity, which itself predicates a public
interest of a serious nature,  have meaning, give rise to legal debate and,
though broad, are not vague but provide an adequate framework and limit for the
exercise of judicial discretion and a means for controlling such exercise while
at the same time allowing for the flexibility required for an effective
administration of justice and implementation of the rule of law.  It must be
underlined that the bail process is subject to very exacting procedural
guarantees which both structure and guide the exercise of judicial discretion.

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and La Forest, Sopinka, McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ. was delivered by

 

                   Lamer
C.J. -- This appeal was
argued along with R. v. Pearson, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 000.  Both cases
involve the constitutionality of the bail provisions of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , and for the first time require this Court to examine the
scope of the right to bail under s. 11 (e) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms .

 

I - Facts

 

                   The respondent
Maximo Morales was arrested in December 1990.  He was charged with trafficking
in narcotics, possession of narcotics for the purpose of trafficking, importing
narcotics and conspiracy to import narcotics, contrary to ss. 4 and 5 of the Narcotic
Control Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. N-1, and s. 465(1) (c) of the Criminal
Code .  He is alleged to have participated in a major network to import
cocaine into Canada.  At the time of his arrest, Morales was awaiting trial for
assault with a weapon, an indictable offence.  He has subsequently been
convicted of that offence.

 

                   A bail hearing was
held shortly after Morales was arrested.  Bail was denied and Morales was
ordered detained in custody until trial.  Morales then made an application
under s. 520  of the Criminal Code  for a review of this order.  This
application was heard by Boilard J. of the Quebec Superior Court on February 1,
1991.  Boilard J. ordered Morales released, subject to a number of conditions.

 

                   On June 20, 1991,
this Court granted the Crown leave to appeal the final judgment of Boilard J.,
[1991] 1 S.C.R. xiii.  The Attorney General of Canada, the Attorney General for
Ontario, the Attorney General of Manitoba and the Attorney General for Alberta
have intervened in support of the position taken by the appellant Crown.  The
Association des avocats de la défense de Montréal and the Criminal Lawyers'
Association have intervened in support of the position taken by the respondent.

 

II - Relevant Statutory and Charter 
Provisions

 

                   At issue in this
appeal is the validity of ss. 515(6) (a), 515(6) (d) and 515(10) (b)
of the Criminal Code , which read as follows:

 

                   515.  ...

 

                   (6) 
Notwithstanding any provision of this section, where an accused is charged

 

(a)
with an indictable offence, other than an offence listed in section 469, that
is alleged to have been committed while he was at large after being released in
respect of another indictable offence pursuant to the provisions of this Part
or section 679 or 680,

 

                                                                    ...

 

(d)
with having committed an offence under section 4 or 5 of the Narcotic
Control Act or the offence of conspiring to commit an offence under section
4 or 5 of that Act,

 

the
justice shall order that the accused be detained in custody until he is dealt
with according to law, unless the accused, having been given a reasonable
opportunity to do so, shows cause why his detention in custody is not
justified, but where the justice orders that the accused be released, he shall
include in the record a statement of his reasons for making the order.

 

                   (10) 
For the purposes of this section, the detention of an accused in custody is
justified only on either of the following grounds: 

 

                                                                    ...

 

(b)
on the secondary ground (the applicability of which shall be determined only in
the event that and after it is determined that his detention is not justified
on the primary ground referred to in paragraph (a)) that his detention
is necessary in the public interest or for the protection or safety of the
public, having regard to all the circumstances including any substantial likelihood
that the accused will, if he is released from custody, commit a criminal
offence or interfere with the administration of justice.

 

                   The relevant
provisions of the Charter  read as follows:

 

                   1.  The Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms  guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only
to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in
a free and democratic society.

 

                   7.  Everyone has the right to life,
liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof
except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

 

                   9.  Everyone has the right not to be
arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.

 

                   11.  Any person charged with an offence
has the right

 

                                                                    ...

 

(d)
to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and
public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal;

 

(e)
not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause;

 

III - Judgment Below

 

Quebec Superior Court (Montreal, No. 500-36-000036-917,
February 1, 1991)

 

                   Boilard J. reviewed
the evidence and held that he was satisfied that Morales was an important
member of a Columbian cocaine importing network.  Boilard J. stated that in the
not too distant past, such evidence would have been sufficient to justify
ordering the accused to be detained in custody until trial.  However, since R.
v. Perron (1989), 51 C.C.C. (3d) 518, [1990] R.J.Q. 1774 (C.A.), and R.
v. Lamothe (1990), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 530, [1990] R.J.Q. 973 (C.A.), the
situation in Quebec had become ""troubled"".  Boilard J. expressed
disagreement with Perron and Lamothe, but held that those
decisions had to be followed until they were modified by the Quebec Court of
Appeal, or until another Canadian court of appeal had examined the situation
and proposed another solution.  Boilard J. made it clear that he was following Perron
and Lamothe without enthusiasm.

 

                   According to Perron
and Lamothe, pre-trial detention is only justified where it is
established that the accused will not appear at trial or that release of the
accused would represent a danger for the public.  Beyond these situations,
regardless of the nature of the offence, all accused must be granted bail. 
Boilard J. stated that he had no choice but to follow the rule which had been
set down by the Quebec Court of Appeal.

 

                   As a result,
Boilard J. ordered Morales released, subject to a number of conditions.

 

IV - Issues

 

                   The following
constitutional questions were stated on July 10, 1991:

 

1.Does
s. 515(10)(b) of the Criminal Code , which permits the preventive
detention of an accused in the public interest or for the protection or safety
of the public, limit ss. 7 , 9 , 11 (d) and 11 (e) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If
the answer to this question is affirmative, is s. 515(10) (b) of the Criminal
Code  a reasonable limit in a free and democratic society and justified
under s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

3.Do
ss. 515(6)(a) and 515(6)(d) of the Criminal Code  limit ss.
7 , 9 , 11 (d) and 11 (e) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms ?

 

4.If
the answer to this question is affirmative, are ss. 515(6) (a) and
515(6) (d) of the Criminal Code  a reasonable limit in a free and
democratic society and justified under s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms ?

 

V - Analysis

 

A.  Validity of Section 515(10) (b)

 

                   Section 515  of the Criminal
Code  sets out ""a liberal and enlightened system of pre-trial
release"" (see R. v. Bray (1983), 2 C.C.C. (3d) 325 (Ont. C.A.), at
p. 328) under which an accused must normally be granted bail.  There are only
two grounds under which pre-trial detention of an accused is justified.  The
primary ground, set out in s. 515(10) (a), is that ""detention is
necessary to ensure [the accused's] attendance in court in order to be dealt
with according to law"".  The validity of this primary ground is not at
issue in this appeal.  The secondary ground, set out in s. 515(10) (b),
is that ""detention is necessary in the public interest or for the
protection or safety of the public, having regard to all the circumstances
including any substantial likelihood that the accused will, if he is released
from custody, commit a criminal offence or interfere with the administration of
justice"".  The validity of this secondary ground is at issue in this
appeal.

 

                   As the appellant
submits, the secondary ground contains two separate components.  Detention can
be justified either in the ""public interest"" or for the
""protection or safety of the public"".  In my view each of these
components entails very different constitutional considerations.  As a result,
the following analysis considers the public interest and public safety
components of s. 515(10) (b) separately.

 

                   (1)  Public
Interest

 

                   For the reasons
which I gave in Pearson, I am of the view that the respondent's
challenge to the grounds upon which bail may be denied, specifically the public
interest and public safety criteria should be considered under the specific
guarantees set out in s. 11 (e) rather than under s. 7 .  However, as will
appear in what follows, the analysis under s. 11 (e) will draw
considerable support from the constitutional doctrine of vagueness which has
been articulated as a principle of fundamental justice.

 

                   (i)  Section 11 (e)

 

                   In Pearson,
I noted that, pursuant to Charter  s. 11 (e), there will be just
cause for denial of bail if the denial can occur only in a narrow set of
circumstances and if the denial is necessary to promote the proper functioning
of the bail system.

 

                   In my view, the
criterion of ""public interest"" as a basis for pre-trial detention
under s. 515(10) (b) violates s. 11 (e) of the Charter 
because it authorizes detention in terms which are vague and imprecise.  D.
Kiselbach, ""Pre-trial Criminal Procedure: Preventive Detention and the
Presumption of Innocence"" (1988-89), 31 Crim. L.Q. 168, at p. 186,
describes ""public interest"" as ""the most nebulous basis for
detention"".  I agree with this characterization of the public interest
component of s. 515(10) (b) and view it as a fatal flaw in the provision.

 

                   A very thorough
review of the constitutional ""doctrine of vagueness"" was recently
undertaken by Gonthier J. in R. v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society,
[1992] 2 S.C.R. 606.  Gonthier J., speaking for the Court, held at p. 626 that
the doctrine of vagueness is a consideration both as a principle of fundamental
justice under s. 7  and in applying s. 1 :

 

Vagueness
can be raised under s. 7  of the Charter , since it is a principle of
fundamental justice that laws may not be too vague.  It can also be raised
under s. 1 of the Charter in limine, on the basis that an enactment is
so vague as not to satisfy the requirement that a limitation on Charter 
rights be ""prescribed by law"".  Furthermore, vagueness is also
relevant to the ""minimal impairment"" stage of the Oakes
test....

 

After noting at p. 632 that ""the
threshold for finding a law vague is relatively high"", Gonthier J. held at
p. 643 that ""a law will be found unconstitutionally vague if it so lacks
in precision as not to give sufficient guidance for legal debate.""  The
rationale for this conclusion was as follows (at pp. 639-40):

 

                   A
vague provision does not provide an adequate basis for legal debate, that is
for reaching a conclusion as to its meaning by reasoned analysis applying legal
criteria.  It does not sufficiently delineate any area of risk, and thus can
provide neither fair notice to the citizen nor a limitation of enforcement
discretion.  Such a provision is not intelligible, to use the terminology of
previous decisions of this Court, and therefore it fails to give sufficient
indications that could fuel a legal debate.  It offers no grasp to the
judiciary.

 

Thus the inability of a vague law to
frame the legal debate in a coherent manner violates the principles of fundamental
justice in s. 7  and affects the analysis under s. 1.  In the same way, there
cannot be just cause for the denial of bail where the statutory criteria for
denial are vague and imprecise.

 

                   All of the cases in
which vagueness has been considered by this Court have involved provisions
which define an offence or prohibit certain conduct: see R. v. Morgentaler,
[1988] 1 S.C.R. 30; Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1989]
1 S.C.R. 927; Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.),
[1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123 (""Prostitution Reference""); R. v.
Keegstra, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697; Canada (Human Rights Commission) v.
Taylor, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 892; Committee for the Commonwealth of Canada v.
Canada, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 139; Osborne v. Canada (Treasury Board),
[1991] 2 S.C.R. 69; R. v. Butler, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 452, and Nova
Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, supra.  Section 515(10) (b) is
somewhat different.  It does not define an offence or prohibit conduct, but
rather provides grounds on which pre-trial detention is authorized.  The
intervener the Attorney General for Ontario submits that this difference is
sufficient to conclude that the doctrine of vagueness should not apply to s.
515(10) (b).

 

                   In my view, the
doctrine of vagueness is applicable to s. 515(10) (b) because there
cannot be just cause for denial of bail within the meaning of s. 11 (e)
if the statutory criteria for denying bail are vague and imprecise.  Nova
Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, at p. 632, identified two rationales for the
doctrine of vagueness, namely fair notice to the citizen and limitation of law
enforcement discretion.  Fair notice is ""an understanding that certain
conduct is the subject of legal restrictions"" (p. 635), a factor which is
not relevant to a provision like s. 515(10) (b) which does not prohibit
conduct.  However, limitation of law enforcement discretion is still a relevant
factor.  In the Prostitution Reference at p. 1157, I explained this
rationale in terms of a ""standardless sweep"": ""is the statute so
pervasively vague that it permits a `standardless sweep' allowing law
enforcement officials to pursue their personal predilections?"".  In my
view the principles of fundamental justice preclude a standardless sweep in any
provision which authorizes imprisonment.  This is all the more so under a
constitutional guarantee not to be denied bail without just cause as set out in
s. 11 (e).  Since pre-trial detention is extraordinary in our system of
criminal justice, vagueness in defining the terms of pre-trial detention may be
even more invidious than is vagueness in defining an offence.

  

                   I would also note
that in Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, at p. 642, this Court
expressly stated that the doctrine of vagueness applies to all types of
enactments:

 

                   Finally,
I also wish to point out that the standard I have outlined applies to all
enactments, irrespective of whether they are civil, criminal, administrative or
other.  The citizen is entitled to have the State abide by constitutional
standards of precision whenever it enacts legal dispositions.

 

If the doctrine of vagueness aims to
ensure that all dispositions are framed in terms which permit meaningful legal
debate, then all dispositions are subject to this doctrine regardless of their
form.

 

                   I am also unable to
accept the submission of the intervener the Attorney General for Ontario that
the doctrine of vagueness should not apply to s. 515(10) (b) because it
does not authorize arbitrary practices by law enforcement officials but rather
merely authorizes judicial discretion.  A standardless sweep does not become
acceptable simply because it results from the whims of judges and justices of
the peace rather than the whims of law enforcement officials.  Cloaking whims
in judicial robes is not sufficient to satisfy the principles of fundamental
justice.

 

                   A provision does
not violate the doctrine of vagueness simply because it is subject to
interpretation.  To require absolute precision would be to create an impossible
constitutional standard.  As I stated in the Prostitution Reference at
p. 1157:

 

                   The
fact that a particular legislative term is open to varying interpretations by
the courts is not fatal.  As Beetz J. observed in R. v. Morgentaler,
[1988] 1 S.C.R. 30, at p. 107, ""(f)lexibility and vagueness are not
synonymous"".  Therefore the question at hand is whether the impugned
sections of the Criminal Code  can be or have been given sensible
meanings by the courts.

 

It seems apparent that, at the very
least, the term ""public interest"" is subject to interpretation.  It
accordingly becomes necessary to determine whether it is capable of being given
a constant and settled meaning by the courts.  

 

                   The intervener the
Attorney General for Ontario submits that the term ""public interest""
has been given a ""workable meaning"" by the courts.  The Attorney
General for Ontario cites a number of authorities which are said to establish
this workable meaning.  In Re Powers and the Queen (1972), 9 C.C.C. (2d)
533 (Ont. H.C.), at pp. 544-45, Lerner J. defined ""public interest""
as follows:

 

                   ""Public
interest"" involves many considerations, not the least of which is the
""public image"" of the Criminal Code , the Bail Reform Act
amendments, the apprehension and conviction of criminals, the attempts at
deterrence of crime, and ultimately the protection of that overwhelming
percentage of citizens of Canada who are not only socially conscious but
law-abiding.

 

In R. v. Demyen (1975), 26
C.C.C. (2d) 324 (Sask. C.A.), at p. 326, Culliton C.J.S. stated that the term
""public interest"" gives an unfettered discretion to the court:

 

                   In
my opinion, in the determination of what may constitute the public interest
Parliament intended to give to the Judge a wide and unfettered discretion.  To
attempt to define with particularity what constitutes public interest would not
only be difficult but would likely result in restricting by judicial
pronouncement the unfettered discretion which Parliament intended to confer. 
The proper application, in my view, is to give to public interest a
comprehensive meaning and to decide in the circumstances of each case whether
or not the public interest requires the prisoner's detention.

 

In R. v. Kingwatsiak (1976), 31
C.C.C. (2d) 213 (N.W.T.C.A.), Tallis J. used virtually the same wording to
describe the concept of ""public interest"".  Tallis J.'s formulation
was cited with approval by Wilson J.A. (as she then was) in R. v. Morenstein
(1977), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 131 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 133.  In R. v. Dakin, Ont.
C.A., August 8, 1989, [1989] O.J. No. 1348 (QL Systems), ""public
interest"" was defined as circumstances which would ""adversely affect
the public perception of, and confidence in, the administration of
justice"".

 

                   The intervener
Association des avocats de la défense de Montréal notes that until Perron,
supra, and Lamothe, supra, a number of judges of the
Quebec Superior Court used the ""public interest"" criterion as a
justification for a highly subjective denial of bail to certain persons accused
of narcotics offences: see R. v. Dickie (1979), 14 C.R. (3d) 110 (Que.
Ct. S.P.); R. v. Ghannime (1980), 18 C.R. (3d) 186 (Que. Sup. Ct.); Adam
v. La Reine, Sup. Ct. Montreal, No. 500-27-005960-804, May 7, 1980; R.
v. Mendelsohn, Sup. Ct. Montreal, No. 500-27-009188-824, March 15, 1982; Procureur
général du Canada v. Fuoco, Sup. Ct. Montreal, No. 500-27-034260-820,

Canada v. Zelman, Sup. Ct. Montreal, No. 500-36-000349-871, June 19, 1987.

 

                   In my view, these
authorities do not establish any ""workable meaning"" for the term
""public interest"".  On the contrary, these authorities demonstrate
the open-ended nature of the term.  Demyen, Kingwatsiak and Morenstein
expressly recognized that ""public interest"" imports a standard which
is completely discretionary.  Powers and Dakin relied on an
imprecise notion that the public interest justifies denying bail whenever the
public image of the criminal justice system would be compromised by granting
bail.  The cases in the Quebec Superior Court relied on an imprecise notion
that drug traffickers with no apparent defence should be denied bail.  In my
view, these authorities demonstrate that the term ""public interest""
has not been given a constant or settled meaning by the courts.  The term
provides no guidance for legal debate.  The term authorizes a standardless
sweep, as the court can order imprisonment whenever it sees fit.  According to Nova
Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, at p. 642, such unfettered discretion
violates the doctrine of vagueness:

 

                   What
becomes more problematic is not so much general terms conferring broad
discretion, but terms failing to give direction as to how to exercise this
discretion, so that this exercise may be controlled.  Once more, an
impermissibly vague law will not provide a sufficient basis for legal debate;
it will not give a sufficient indication as to how decisions must be reached,
such as factors to be considered or determinative elements.

 

As currently defined by the courts,
the term ""public interest"" is incapable of framing the legal debate
in any meaningful manner or structuring discretion in any way.

 

                   Nor would it be
possible in my view to give the term ""public interest"" a constant or
settled meaning.  The term gives the courts unrestricted latitude to define any
circumstances as sufficient to justify pre-trial detention.  The term creates no
criteria to define these circumstances.  No amount of judicial interpretation
of the term ""public interest"" would be capable of rendering it a
provision which gives any guidance for legal debate.

 

                   As a result, the
public interest component of s. 515(10) (b) violates the s. 11 (e)
of the Charter  because it authorizes a denial of bail without just
cause. 

 

                   (ii) Section 1

 

                   In my view, this
violation is not justified under s. 1.  The limit cannot be justified under the
test in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, and may be too vague even to
constitute a limit which is ""prescribed by law"" under s. 1.

 

                   Although the term
""public interest"" may well be so vague that it does not constitute a
limit which is ""prescribed by law"" under s. 1, as Gonthier J. noted
in Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, at p. 627, ""[t]he Court will
be reluctant to find a disposition so vague as not to qualify as `law' under s.
1 in limine, and will rather consider the scope of the disposition under
the `minimal impairment' test"".  Accordingly, I prefer to proceed
immediately to the Oakes test.

 

                   Even if the term
""public interest"" is capable of passing the threshold test under s. 1
of being a limit which is ""prescribed by law"", I am of the opinion
that it cannot be justified under the Oakes test.  I am prepared to
accept that the term ""public interest"" could be justified under the
first branch of the Oakes test.  In my view, s. 515(10) (b) has
two objectives, both of which are apparent from the wording of the provision. 
The first objective is to prevent those who have been arrested from committing
criminal offences.  The second objective is to prevent those who have been
arrested from interfering with the administration of justice.  This second
objective is extremely important.  The criminal justice system cannot function
properly if it is subverted by the accused's interference with the
administration of justice.  In my opinion, the objective of preventing such
interference is sufficiently important to warrant overriding a constitutionally
protected right.  The first objective of s. 515(10) (b) is also
important.  The prevention of crime is one objective of all criminal law.  I am
prepared to accept that the objective of preventing crime by those who have
already been accused of criminal conduct is sufficiently important to warrant
overriding a constitutionally protected right.

 

                   However, in my view
the public interest component of s. 515(10) (b) does not meet the second
branch of the Oakes test, the proportionality test.  None of the three
components of the proportionality test is met.  First, there is no rational
connection between the measure and the objectives of preventing crime and
preventing interference with the administration of justice.  As the respondent
submits, the provision is so vague that it does not provide any means to
determine which accused are most likely to commit offences or interfere with
the administration of justice while on bail.  It accordingly authorizes
pre-trial detention in many cases which are not related to the objectives of
the measure.  Second, the measure does not impair rights as little as
possible.  In both R. v. Keegstra, supra, at pp. 785-86, and R.
v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 626, vagueness was a factor
relevant to determining whether there had been a minimal impairment of rights. 
Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society noted at p. 627 that ""vagueness
as it relates to the `minimal impairment' branch of s. 1 merges with the
related concept of overbreadth"".  The vague and overbroad concept of
public interest permits far more pre-trial detention than is required to meet
the limited objectives of preventing crime and preventing interference with the
administration of justice by those who are on bail.  Accordingly, it does not
constitute a minimal impairment of rights.  Third, there is no proportionality
between the effects of the measure and its objectives.  By authorizing
excessive pre-trial detention, the effects of the limit far exceed the
objectives of the measure.

 

                   As a result, the
violation of s. 11 (e) is not justified under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

                   (2)  Public
Safety

 

                   It remains to
determine whether the public safety component of s. 515(10) (b) is
constitutionally valid.  The respondent submits that the public safety
component of s. 515(10) (b) violates ss. 7 , 9 , 11 (d) and 11 (e)
of the Charter .  I will consider each of these provisions in turn.

 

                   As stated in my
reasons in R. v. Pearson, supra, released simultaneously with
these reasons, I am of opinion that s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
creates a procedural and evidentiary rule which operates at the trial requiring
the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. 
However, as in Pearson, s. 11(d) has no application at the bail
stage where guilt or innocence is not determined and where punishment is not
imposed.  I conclude, therefore that the public safety component of s. 515(10) (b)
does not infringe s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

                   With respect to the
arguments on this branch of the case advanced under s. 7 , I am of the view
that, for the reasons given in Pearson, the respondent's challenge
should be determined under s. 11 (e) because that section ""offers
""a highly specific guarantee"" which covers precisely the respondent's
complaint"" (p. 000).

 

                   (i)  Section 11 (e)

 

                   In Pearson,
I made some general remarks about the nature of the right under s. 11 (e). 
I noted that s. 11 (e) contains two distinct elements, namely a
""reasonable bail"" element and a ""just cause"" element. 
Reasonable bail relates to the terms of bail, while just cause relates to the
grounds on which bail is granted or denied.  The public safety component of s.
515(10) (b) defines the grounds on which bail can be denied, and
accordingly its validity depends on the just cause element of s. 11 (e).

 

                   In Pearson,
I noted that s. 11 (e) creates a basic entitlement to bail.  Bail must be
granted unless pre-trial detention is justified by the prosecution.  In Pearson,
the issue was the validity of a provision which departs from this basic
entitlement.  The validity of the public safety component of s. 515(10) (b)
involves a more fundamental question, namely the scope of the basic entitlement
to bail under s. 11 (e).  Section 515(10) (b) defines the basic
entitlement to bail under the Criminal Code  by establishing grounds on
which pre-trial detention is justified.  The issue is to determine whether the
basic entitlement to bail under the Criminal Code  is consistent with the
basic entitlement to bail under s. 11 (e) of the Charter .  In
other words, the issue is to determine whether the public safety component of
s. 515(10) (b) provides just cause to deny bail in accordance with the
requirements of s. 11 (e).

 

                   The public safety
component of s. 515(10) (b) provides that pre-trial detention is
justified where it is necessary ""for the protection or safety of the
public, having regard to all the circumstances including any substantial
likelihood that the accused will, if he is released from custody, commit a
criminal offence or interfere with the administration of justice"".  The
appellant concedes, quite properly in my opinion, that danger or likelihood
that an individual will commit a criminal offence does not in itself provide
just cause for detention.  In general, our society does not countenance preventive
detention of individuals simply because they have a proclivity to commit
crime.  The appellant accepts this proposition but submits that there is just
cause for preventive detention where an individual who presents a danger of
committing an offence is already awaiting trial for a criminal offence.

 

                    In Pearson,
I identified two factors which in my view are vital to a determination that
there is just cause under s. 11 (e).  First, the denial of bail must
occur only in a narrow set of circumstances.  Second, the denial of bail must
be necessary to promote the proper functioning of the bail system and must not
be undertaken for any purpose extraneous to the bail system.  In my opinion,
the public safety component of s. 515(10) (b) provides just cause to deny
bail within these criteria.

 

                   I am satisfied that
the scope of the public safety component of s. 515(10) (b) is
sufficiently narrow to satisfy the first requirement under s. 11 (e). 
Bail is not denied for all individuals who pose a risk of committing an offence
or interfering with the administration of justice while on bail.  Bail is
denied only for those who pose a ""substantial likelihood"" of
committing an offence or interfering with the administration of justice, and
only where this ""substantial likelihood"" endangers ""the
protection or safety of the public"".  Moreover, detention is justified
only when it is ""necessary"" for public safety.  It is not justified
where detention would merely be convenient or advantageous.  Such grounds are
sufficiently narrow to fulfil the first requirement of just cause under s. 11 (e).

 

                   I am also satisfied
that the public safety component of s. 515(10) (b) is necessary to
promote the proper functioning of the bail system and is not undertaken for any
purpose extraneous to the bail system.  In my view, the bail system does not
function properly if an accused interferes with the administration of justice
while on bail.  The entire criminal justice system is subverted if an accused
interferes with the administration of justice.  If an accused is released on
bail, it must be on condition that he or she will refrain from tampering with
the administration of justice.  If there is a substantial likelihood that the
accused will not give this cooperation, it furthers the objectives of the bail
system to deny bail.

 

                   In my view, the
bail system also does not function properly if individuals commit crimes while
on bail.  One objective of the entire system of criminal justice is to stop
criminal behaviour.  The bail system releases individuals who have been accused
but not convicted of criminal conduct, but in order to achieve the objective of
stopping criminal behaviour, such release must be on condition that the accused
will not engage in criminal activity pending trial.  In Pearson, the
reality that persons engaged in drug trafficking tend to continue their
criminal behaviour even after an arrest was one basis for concluding that there
is just cause to require persons charged with certain narcotics offences to
justify bail.  Similarly, if there is a substantial likelihood that the accused
will engage in criminal activity pending trial, it furthers the objectives of
the bail system to deny bail.

 

                   The respondent
submits that the public safety component of s. 515(10) (b) is flawed
because it is based on the premise that potential recidivism can be predicted
but recidivism is in fact impossible to predict.  The respondent cites a number
of studies, including a study by Professor Landreville of the École de
criminologie de Montréal and a number of studies from the United States.  These
studies demonstrate that the art of predicting recidivism and future
dangerousness is, at the very least, a somewhat inexact process.

 

                   While it is
undoubtedly the case that it is impossible to make exact predictions about
recidivism and future dangerousness, exact predictability of future
dangerousness is not constitutionally mandated.  In R. v. Lyons, [1987]
2 S.C.R. 309, at pp. 364-65, La Forest J. considered the validity of the
dangerous offender provisions of the Criminal Code :

 

However,
as Holmes has reminded us, the life of the law has not been logic: it has been
experience.  The criminal law must operate in a world governed by practical
considerations rather than abstract logic and, as a matter of practicality, the
most that can be established in a future context is a likelihood of certain
events occurring....

 

It
seems to me that a ""likelihood"" of specified future conduct occurring
is the finding of fact required to be established; it is not, at one and the
same time, the means of proving that fact.  Logically, it seems clear to me
that an individual can be found to constitute a threat to society
without insisting that this require the court to assert an ability to predict
the future.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

                   The bail system has
always made an effort to assess the likelihood of future dangerousness while
recognizing that exact predictions of future dangerousness are impossible.  The
Report of the Canadian Committee on Corrections (Ouimet Report (1969)),
one of the studies which led to the current bail system, recognized the
impossibility of precise predictions at p. 110:

 

                   It
has been argued that there is no accurate way of predicting the accused's
behaviour pending trial.  Even if a measure of predictability could be
achieved, any fact‑finding process for determining this issue would be so
time‑consuming as to nullify the purpose of bail.

 

                   We
think the issued [sic] involved are no more difficult than others which
courts are constantly called upon to resolve in other areas of the law.  Some
reasonable assessment of the probability of the accused's behaviour pending
trial is not impossible.  If the prosecution does not make out a reasonable
case for denial of bail, it follows that it should be granted.

 

The bail system does not aim to make
exact predictions about future dangerousness because such predictions are
impossible to make.  However, Lyons demonstrates that it is sufficient
to establish a likelihood of dangerousness, and that the impossibility of
making exact predictions does not preclude a bail system which aims to deny
bail to those who likely will be dangerous.

 

                   Furthermore, as the
intervener the Attorney General for Ontario submits, there are substantial
procedural safeguards against the inefficacy of predictions about
dangerousness.  Bail cannot be denied unless there is a ""substantial
likelihood"" that the accused will commit a criminal offence while on bail
or will interfere with the administration of justice.  Such a determination can
only be made after an adversarial proceeding, which takes place under exacting
procedural protections (see s. 518).  If an accused is detained, there are
numerous provisions for review (see ss. 520, 523(2) and 525).  There are
provisions to expedite the trial of an accused who is detained (see ss. 525(9)
and 526).  An accused who is detained is also protected by s. 11 (b) of
the Charter , which guarantees the right to be tried within a reasonable
time. 

 

                   The public safety
component of s. 515(10) (b) establishes narrow circumstances in which
bail is denied.  Those circumstances are necessary to promote the proper
functioning of the bail system and are not undertaken for any purpose
extraneous to the bail system.  Accordingly, the public safety component of s.
515(10) (b) does not violate s. 11 (e).

 

                   (ii) Section 9 

 

                   In Pearson,
I dealt with s. 9  very briefly.  The validity of the public safety component of
s. 515(10) (b) under s. 9  can also be dealt with very briefly.  There is
no question that the public safety component of s. 515(10) (b) provides
for persons to be ""detained"" within the meaning of s. 9  of the Charter . 
The sole issue is to determine whether those persons are detained
""arbitrarily"".  Le Dain J. discussed the meaning of
""arbitrarily"" in R. v. Hufsky, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 621.  He held
at p. 633 that detention is arbitrary if it is governed by unstructured
discretion: ""discretion is arbitrary if there are no criteria, express or
implied, which govern its exercise.""

 

                   In my view,
detention under the public safety component of s. 515(10) (b) is not
arbitrary in this sense.  The public safety component of s. 515(10) (b)
is not discretionary.  It sets out a process with fixed standards and sets
specific conditions for bail.  Unlike the completely random detention which was
held to violate s. 9  in Hufsky, R. v. Ladouceur, [1990] 1 S.C.R.
1257, and R. v. Wilson, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1291, detention under the public
safety component of s. 515(10) (b) is not random.  Furthermore, the bail
process is subject to very exacting procedural guarantees which I reviewed in
my reasons in Pearson.

 

                   Accordingly, I
conclude that the public safety component of s. 515(10) (b) does not
violate s. 9 .

 

                   (iii) Section 1 

 

                   The parties and
interveners have made extensive submissions about the application of s. 1 . 
Given that I have found no violation of ss. 7 , 9 , 11 (d) or 11 (e),
it is not necessary to consider s. 1 .

 

                   (3)  Severance

 

                   Thus the public
interest component of s. 515(10) (b) is constitutionally invalid but the
public safety component is constitutionally valid.  It therefore becomes
necessary to determine whether this result requires all of s. 515(10) (b)
to be struck down, or whether the invalid portion of the provision can be
severed from the rest of the provision.  In my view, severance is possible.

 

                   R. v. Wholesale
Travel Group Inc.,
[1991] 3 S.C.R. 154, at p. 207, held that a severable portion of a statutory
provision can be struck down without having to strike down the entire
provision, provided that severance would not defeat a ""unitary
scheme"" envisaged by Parliament.  Severance does not usurp Parliament's
role, but rather is the approach which best fulfils the terms of s. 52(1)  of
the Constitution Act, 1982 , which provides that a law which is
inconsistent with the Constitution is of no force and effect ""to the
extent of the inconsistency"".  Severance is also least intrusive to the
overall statutory scheme.

 

                   In my view,
removing the criterion of public interest from s. 515(10) (b) would not
defeat a unitary scheme envisaged by Parliament.  The courts have generally
regarded the criteria of ""public interest"" and ""public
safety"" in s. 515(10) (b) as disjunctive: see R. v. Bradley
(1977), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 283 (Que. Sup. Ct.), at p. 289, and R. v. Lebel
(1989), 70 C.R. (3d) 83 (Que. Sup. Ct.), at p. 88.  If these two criteria are
disjunctive, it would not interfere with a unitary scheme to strike down only
one of them.  In Rocket v. Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 232, at p. 252, McLachlin J. held that severance was not
possible because it was impossible to strike down the specific offending
provisions and leave the balance of the provision to stand as a functioning
whole.  By contrast, the words ""in the public interest or"" can be
struck from s. 515(10) (b) and the remaining provision will be a
functioning whole.

 

                   In Rocket,
McLachlin J. also rejected the possibility of severance because the structure
of the provision, limited exclusions to a general prohibition, would require
the Court to supply further exceptions, which was the proper role of the
legislature.  By contrast, the structure of s. 515(10) (b) presents no
such difficulty.  Severance would not require the Court to add anything to s.
515(10) (b) to create a viable provision.  In this case, severance is the
means by which the Court's interference with the legislative function can be
minimized.  Striking down all of s. 515(10) (b) simply because its public
interest component is invalid would eliminate a part of the bail system which
is constitutionally valid and which Parliament has decided should be part of
the bail system.  There is no basis for this Court to interfere with
Parliament's view that the public safety component of s. 515(10) (b)
should be a part of the bail system.  Severance therefore allows the Court to
fulfil its judicial role without usurping Parliament's legislative role.

 

                   As a result, I
conclude that the offending words of s. 515(10) (b), specifically
""in the public interest or"", are severable and should be struck
down.  The remaining portion of s. 515(10) (b) is constitutionally valid.

 

B.  Validity of Section 515(6) (a)

 

                   The analysis of s.
515(6) (a) parallels the structure of the analysis of s. 515(6) (d)
in Pearson and the analysis of the public safety component of s.
515(10) (b) in this case.  Section 11 (d) of the Charter 
does not apply and the case should be analysed under s. 11 (e) rather
than the more general provisions of s. 7 .

 

                   (i) Section 11 (e)

 

                   Analysis of s.
515(6)(a) under s. 11 (e) is very similar to the analysis of
515(6)(d) in Pearson under s. 11 (e).  Once again, the
focus is on the just cause element of s. 11 (e).  Like s. 515(6)(d),
s. 515(6)(a) requires the accused to demonstrate that bail is justified,
thereby denying the basic entitlement under s. 11 (e) to be granted bail
unless pre-trial detention is justified by the prosecution.  This denial of the
basic entitlement to bail is constitutionally valid only if it meets the
constitutional test of ""just cause"" in s. 11 (e) or is
justified under s. 1 .

 

                   As noted in Pearson
and in my discussion of s. 515(10) (b) under s. 11 (e), there is
just cause to deny bail under s. 11 (e) if two factors are present.  The
denial of bail must occur only in a narrow set of circumstances, and the denial
of bail must be necessary to promote the proper functioning of the bail system
and must not be undertaken for any purpose extraneous to the bail system.  In
my opinion, s. 515(6)(a) provides just cause to deny bail within these criteria.

 

                   Section 515(6)(a)
provides that an accused must justify the granting of bail when the accused is
charged with an indictable offence ""that is alleged to have been committed
while he was at large after being released in respect of another indictable
offence"".  As a preliminary matter, I would like to express agreement with
the appellant's submission that the English version of this provision is more
accurate than is the French version.  The English version uses the phrase
""that is alleged to have been committed"", while the French version
uses the phrase ""qui est présumé avoir été commis"".  The
English version is more accurate because it emphasizes that the mere act of
charging an accused who is on bail does not prove (or even create a
presumption) that the accused committed an offence while on bail.  However,
charges cannot be laid unless there are reasonable grounds for believing that
an offence has been committed (see s. 504  of the Criminal Code ).  Thus
when an accused is charged while on bail, it is neither proven nor presumed
that the accused has committed an offence while on bail, but there are
reasonable grounds for believing that this has occurred.  The fact that s.
515(6) (a) applies only when there are reasonable grounds to believe that
recidivism has occurred is a factor which is emphasized by a number of
interveners.

 

                   As the appellant
and several of the interveners submit, the validity of s. 515(6)(a) is
easier to establish than is the validity of s. 515(6)(d).  Section
515(6)(a) relates to the accused's particular circumstances, while s.
515(6)(d) relates to the nature of the offence.  This distinction was
relied upon by the Quebec Court of Appeal in Pearson as one basis for
concluding that s. 515(6)(d) was invalid.

 

                   I am satisfied that
the scope of s. 515(6)(a) is sufficiently narrow to satisfy the first
requirement of just cause under s. 11 (e).  Section 515(6)(a)
applies only to indictable offences.  The number of accused who are charged
with an indictable offence while on bail for another indictable offence is,
hopefully, rather small.  Furthermore, s. 515(6)(a) does not deny bail
for all persons who have been charged with an indictable offence while on bail
for another indictable offence, but rather denies bail only when these persons
do not show cause that detention is not justified.  Such grounds are
sufficiently narrow to fulfil the first requirement of just cause under s. 11 (e).

 

                   I also find that
the effect of s. 515(6)(a) satisfies the second requirement of just
cause under s. 11 (e).  The effect of s. 515(6)(a) is very similar
to the effect of s. 515(6)(d).  Both provisions establish a set of
special bail rules in circumstances where the normal bail system does not
function properly.  As I noted in my discussion of s. 515(10)(b), one of
the objectives of the criminal justice system, including the bail system, is to
stop criminal behaviour.  As a result, bail is granted on condition that the
accused will cease criminal behaviour.  Section 515(6)(a) establishes a
set of special bail rules where there are reasonable grounds to believe that
the accused has already breached this condition.  In other words, the special
bail rules in s. 515(6)(a) apply where there are reasonable grounds to believe
that one of the objectives of the bail system, namely stopping criminal
behaviour, is not being achieved.  By requiring the accused to justify bail, s.
515(6)(a) seeks to ensure that the objective of stopping criminal
behaviour will be achieved.

 

                   Section 515(6)(a)
applies in circumstances where there are reasonable grounds to believe that one
of the grounds in s. 515(10) (b) is present to justify denying bail. 
Even the intervener the Criminal Lawyers' Association concedes that the fact
that an accused was rearrested while on bail may be a relevant factor in
determining whether the grounds in s. 515(10) (b) are met, although it
submits that s. 515(6)(a) goes too far in making this factor justify
detention in itself.  Thus the validity of s. 515(6)(a) under s. 11 (e)
is closely related to the validity of the public safety component of s.
515(10) (b) under s. 11 (e).  If there is just cause for pre-trial
detention where there is a substantial likelihood that the accused will commit
an offence while on bail, then there is just cause to establish a set of
special bail rules where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the
accused has already committed an offence while on bail.  As the intervener the
Attorney General for Alberta expresses it, one who reoffends while on bail was
previously judged to be trustworthy.  If there are reasonable grounds to
believe that this trust has been violated, some further basis is required to
trust the accused again.  A lack of representations from the accused leads to a
conclusion that the original assessment that there was no substantial
likelihood of danger to the public was wrong and that there is just cause to
deny bail.

  

                   In my view, the
special bail rules in s. 515(6)(a) do not have any purpose extraneous to
the bail system, but rather merely establish an effective bail system in
circumstances where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the normal
bail system is permitting continuing criminal behaviour.  The scope of these
special rules is narrow and carefully tailored to achieve a properly
functioning bail system.  I therefore conclude that there is just cause for s.
515(6)(a) to depart from the basic entitlement to bail under s. 11 (e)
and to deny bail in certain circumstances.  Accordingly, s. 515(6)(a)
does not violate s. 11 (e).

 

                   (ii) Section 9 

 

                   For the reasons
that I set out in my discussion of s. 9  in Pearson, I am of the view
that s. 515(6)(a) does not provide for detention which is arbitrary in
the sense of Hufsky, supra.  Like s. 515(6)(d), s. 515(6)(a)
sets out a process which is not discretionary and which is subject to fixed
standards.  Section 515(6)(a) contains highly structured criteria and
sets out specific conditions for bail.  The result is that detention under s.
515(6)(a) is not random.  In addition, the bail process is subject to
very exacting procedural guarantees (see ss. 516, 518(1)(b), 523(2)(b))
and subject to review by a superior court (see ss. 520 and 521).

 

                   Accordingly, I
conclude that s. 515(6)(a) does not violate s. 9 .

 

                   (iii) Section 1 

 

                   The parties made
extensive submissions about the application of s. 1 .  Given that I have found
no violation of ss. 7 , 9 , 11 (d) or 11 (e), it is not necessary to
consider s. 1 .

 

C.  Validity of section 515(6)(d)

 

                   For the reasons I
set out in Pearson, I am of the opinion that s. 515(6)(d), to the
extent that it requires the accused to show cause that detention is not
justified, does not violate ss. 7 , 9 , 11 (d) or 11 (e) of the Charter .

 

VI -  Application to This Appeal

 

                   In the specific
context of this appeal, the appellant submits that the Superior Court made
three errors in conducting its bail review under s. 520  of the Criminal Code . 
First, the appellant submits that the Superior Court erred in applying the
presumption of innocence at the bail stage of the criminal process.  Second,
the appellant submits that the Superior Court erred in holding that pre-trial
detention is only justified where it is established that the accused will not
appear for trial or would represent a danger to public safety if released. 
Third, the appellant submits that the Superior Court erred in refusing to apply
the procedure mandated in ss. 515(6) (a) and 515(6) (d) of the Criminal
Code .

 

                   The determination
of the constitutional issues resolves these issues.  The presumption of
innocence, as I have said in Pearson, is a principle of fundamental
justice which applies at all stages of the criminal process, although its
procedural requirements at the bail stage are satisfied whenever the requirements
of s. 11 (e) are satisfied.  The Superior Court did not err in holding
that pre-trial detention is only justified where it is established that the
accused will not appear for trial or would represent a danger to public safety
if released.  These two grounds are the only grounds specified in s. 515(10) 
which survive Charter  challenge.  However, the Superior Court did err in
refusing to apply the procedure mandated by ss. 515(6) (a) and 515(6) (d),
both of which are constitutionally valid.

 

                   As a result, the
matter must be remitted to the Superior Court for a new bail review under s.
520  in which ss. 515(6) (a) and 515(6) (d) are applied and s.
515(10) (b) is applied after severance of the words ""in the public
interest or"".

 

VII -  Disposition

 

                   The appeal is
allowed and the matter is remitted to the Superior Court for a new bail review
under s. 520  of the Criminal Code .  The constitutional questions are
answered as follows:

 

1.Does
s. 515(10)(b) of the Criminal Code , which permits the preventive
detention of an accused in the public interest or for the protection or safety
of the public, limit ss. 7 , 9 , 11 (d) and 11 (e) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer:With
respect to public safety, the answer is no.  With respect to public interest,
the words ""in the public interest or"" in s. 515(10)(b) limit
s. 11 (e).  It is not necessary to answer with respect to s. 9 .

 

2.If,
and to the extent the answer to this question is affirmative in whole
or in part, is s. 515(10) (b) of the Criminal Code  a
reasonable limit in a free and democratic society and justified under s. 1  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer:No,
but only to the extent that the words ""in the public interest or""
violate s. 11 (e) and those words are declared of no force or effect. 
With respect to the provision remaining after severance of the words ""in
the public interest or"", it is not necessary to answer this question.

 

3.Do
ss. 515(6)(a) and 515(6)(d) of the Criminal Code  limit ss.
7 , 9 , 11 (d) and 11 (e) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms ?

 

Answer:With
respect to ss. 7 , 9  and 11 (d) of the Charter , the answer is no. 
With respect to s. 11 (e), the answer is yes, but only to the extent that
the sections have reference to that part of s. 515(10) (b) which has been
held to be of no force or effect.

 

4.If
the answer to this question is affirmative, are ss. 515(6) (a) and
515(6) (d) of the Criminal Code  a reasonable limit in a free and
democratic society and justified under s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer:
It is not necessary to answer this question.

 

                   The appellant shall
pay the disbursements and costs of the respondent in this Court, according to
the Tariff of Fees of the Government of Quebec for counsel retained from outside
the Public Service.

 

//Gonthier J.//

 

                   The reasons of
L'Heureux-Dubé and Gonthier JJ. were delivered by

 

                   Gonthier
J. -- I have had the
benefit of the reasons of the Chief Justice and am in agreement with them, with
the exception of his finding that the criterion of public interest is
unconstitutional on grounds of vagueness.

 

                   The issue in the
present case is governed by s. 11 (e) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  which reads:

 

                   11.  Any person charged with an offence
has the right

 

                                                                    ...

 

(e) 
not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause;

 

and thereby sets the specific
requirements of the Charter  as to the granting of bail.  These criteria
thereby define the principles of fundamental justice applicable in this respect
under s. 7  of the Charter  as well as the accused's right not to be
arbitrarily detained or imprisoned pursuant to s. 9  in so far as the bail
determination is concerned.

 

                   Section 11 (e)
provides two criteria, that of reasonable bail which governs the bail
conditions, and just cause which governs the reasons for denying bail.  We are
only here concerned with the latter.

 

                   The concept of just
cause, though very broad, is by its very use in the Charter  and
therefore by definition not so vague as to be unconstitutional.  Like many
legal concepts which are broad in their scope, it is a concept which is
susceptible to particularization in several ways, including particularization
by means of legislative provisions, such as s. 515(10)  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  All such particularizations must naturally accord with
the requirements of the content of the concept of just cause.  The concept of
just cause governs directly the granting or denial of bail by a judge in the
same manner as other qualified legal rights, such as those under ss. 8 , 9 , 10 
and elsewhere under s. 11  of the Charter , govern the legal determinations
subject to the requirements of those rights.  

 

                   Public interest as
referred to in s. 515(10) (b) therefore falls within the purview of
just cause and is intended to be one particularization of just cause.  The
concept of just cause includes this particularization, and it is in terms of
the entire concept that the meaning of public interest must be understood.  The
issue which has been raised is whether the particularization is so vague as to
have no meaning and, consequently, be contrary to the Charter .

 

                   I am unable to
reach the conclusion that this is so.  Public interest is a concept long
recognized in our legal system.  It is a notion which has traditionally been
recognized as affording a means of referring to the special set of
considerations which are relevant to those legal determinations concerned with
the relationship of the represented private interest or interests and the
broader interest of the public.  The phrase ""public interest"" is used
to capture substantive law criteria in matters of law ranging, for example,
from the boundaries of privilege in relation to the ordering of the production
of documents to the formulation of rules governing the restraint of trade. 
While these substantive rules are not relevant here, it is significant that the
accommodation within this phrase ""the public interest"" of numerous
and varied considerations has not been traditionally viewed as grounds for its
exclusion from operation in any particular legal domain.  To view it in such a
way would suggest that it is not appropriate to have recourse to the context in
which a concept exists or is applied in the law in order to elaborate that
concept properly.  Similar to the process of the application of the notions of
""due process"" in the administration of justice and ""fairness""
in the exercise of discretionary powers, the evaluation and elaboration of a
public interest criterion must proceed with reference to the particular context
in which it is to operate.

 

                   The Chief Justice
rightly does not accept the submission of the Attorney General for Ontario that
the doctrine of vagueness should have no application to s. 515(10) (b)
of the Criminal Code  on the basis that the provision does not authorize
arbitrary practices by law enforcement officials, but rather merely authorizes
judicial discretion.  It is true, further, that the principles of fundamental
justice preclude a ""standardless sweep"" in any provision which
authorizes imprisonment.

 

                   While these are
important considerations, they cannot alone form an adequate basis for judging
the value or the nature of the discretion which exists pursuant to the
application of a public interest criterion.

 

                   The liberty
interest of the accused is, undoubtedly, a very important matter which must be
brought to bear on any consideration of the process by which bail is granted or
denied.  Yet, it is also evident that it is only one of several important
considerations of this kind which bear on such an inquiry.  Indeed, the bail
process cannot be accurately described wholly in terms of the discrete aims of
the criminal law.  While a finding of guilt under the criminal law will often
result in a deprivation of the liberty of the guilty party, depending upon the
sentence, a finding of criminal guilt also constitutes a recognition of a
contravention of one or more of the most important norms which govern our
society.  It is the breach of rules of this kind which contributes to the
justness of the detention.  It is partly for this reason that a special stigma
is viewed as being attached to a criminal conviction.

 

                   Unlike that of the
application of the criminal law, the purpose of a denial of bail is neither
punishment, nor is it retribution or reform.  Rather, it is better understood
as a part of the process by which those aims of the law may eventually be
achieved by safeguarding the proper functioning of the justice system.  Far
from obscuring the importance of liberty, a consideration of the administration
of justice in these broader terms is necessary for the due recognition of the
ways in which the administration of justice allows liberty to be properly
respected.

 

                   Any narrower
treatment of the issue raises the problems inherent in approaching an
evaluation of the nature of a conferred discretion in terms of its potential
for improper exercise, and proceeding without reference to the matter of its
capacity to serve the intended aims of the provision.  It must be noted that
such an approach has not been the traditional means of addressing the question
of the vagueness of a provision in constitutional law.  Indeed, to do so would
be contrary to the understanding of vagueness formulated by this Court in R.
v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606, where it was
stated, at p. 627, that:

 

Factors
to be considered in determining whether a law is too vague include (a) the need
for flexibility and the interpretative role of the courts, (b) the
impossibility of achieving absolute certainty, a standard of intelligibility
being more appropriate and (c) the possibility that many varying judicial
interpretations of a given disposition may exist and perhaps coexist....

 

                   It must also be
noted that such an approach also fails to contribute to an understanding of the
difference between properly and improperly exercised discretion.  The
importance of this distinction is manifest in this area of the law where other
notions which are both broad as well as proximate in their content to that of
the public interest, like the ""safety"" of the public, must
necessarily form a part of the reasons either for a grant or a denial of bail. 
For example, in R. v. Dickie (1979), 14 C.R. (3d) 110 (Que. Ct. S.P.),
and in R. v. Ghannime (1980), 18 C.R. (3d) 186 (Que. Sup. Ct.), to which
the Chief Justice makes reference, Boilard J. discusses the public
interest and the safety of the public, and founds the decision to order
preventive detention and deny bail both on the grounds of the public interest
as well as the safety and security of the public.

 

                   Consequently, the
identification of a measure of discretion conferred by means of a legislative
provision cannot alone provide the basis for a constitutional evaluation of
that provision.  Nor can the identification of possible parameters of that
discretion, for a discretion which is referred to as being fettered can be one which
is limited not only by appropriate constraints but also by those which are
inappropriate or unsuitable.  The more important issue which remains,
therefore, is what kind of discretion is conferred, and the capacity of the
words of the legislative provision to support the type of reasoning which the
matter under adjudication requires.

 

                   In this regard, it
is not surprising to note that the common law has traditionally allowed special
recognition of the fact that the adjudication of questions relating to the
process and due administration of the court is to be handled as a matter
relating to the administration of justice and, as such, on a case by case
basis.  This inherent jurisdiction of the court includes not only the common
law offence of contempt of court, for example, but also extends to the power of
the court in relation to the regulation of process and the exercise of powers
by summary process following an abuse of process.  (See further: 
I. H. Jacob, ""The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court"" (1970),
23 C.L.P. 23.)  The importance of these rules is evident in their direct
relationship with the citizen's right to access to justice, and the
multiplicity and breadth of considerations which are brought to bear in this
area of the law ought to be understood as a reflection of the fact that
""the essential character of a superior court of law necessarily involves
that it should be invested with a power to maintain its authority ...""
(Jacob, supra, at p. 27).  The nature of the application of these rules
reflects the requirement that they be reasonably flexible and applicable even
in unforeseen and unusual circumstances.  As is the case with the law governing
the granting or denial of bail, they may accurately be contrasted to the
codified rules of the criminal law which reflect the requirement that the norms
which govern conduct, and the contravention of which may result in
incarceration, be both promulgated and formulated so as to allow for a high
degree of certainty.  Despite these differences, the two types of rules have
been viewed as mutually supportive both in relation to each other as well as to
the broader aims of the law, and ought to be so viewed.  This understanding is
consistent with the conclusion of this Court in Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical
Society, supra, at p. 642, where the reference which ought to
be made to particular features of the law did not detract from the conclusion
that:

 

...
the standard I have outlined applies to all enactments, irrespective of whether
they are civil, criminal, administrative or other.

 

                   It is in light of
these considerations that both the context and the content of the public
interest criterion in s. 515 (10(b) must be viewed.

 

                   In this regard, it
is, first, significant to recognize the general sense of the phrase, which is a
reference to the special set of values which are best understood from the point
of view of the aggregate good and are of relevance to matters relating to the
well-being of society.  Indeed, in this sense it is at the heart of our legal
system and inspires all legislation as well as the administration of justice. 
Its content is in turn expressed by laws, be they the Constitution, the common
law or legislation.  The Charter  is an expression of the fundamental
values which direct the public interest.  The concept of public interest is
indeed broad but it is not meaningless, nor is it vague.  The breadth of the
concept of the public interest has been viewed as a necessary aspect of a
notion which accommodates a host of important considerations which permit the
law to serve a necessarily wide variety of public goals.  In the words of Lord
Morris, when a legal system operates on the basis that ""the law is made
for the public and not the public for the law"", it is as a matter of
course that ""[o]ver and again in the substance and in the administration
of the law we meet the conceptions of the public interest and of public policy"" 
(""The Interaction of Public Interest, Public Policy and Public Opinion in
Relation to the Law"" (1979), 10  Cambrian L. Rev. 29, at p.
29).   

 

                   At the same time,
it is clear that the notion of public interest also operates as a reference for
the rules of law which bear upon legal determinations of when the interest of
the public will be specially considered, the relationship which those interests
will have to other interests which fall to be considered, and the extent to
which the public interest is to be protected by the law.  It is therefore
important to refer to two aspects of the context in which the criterion of
public interest is to be considered.  The first relates to the application of a
public interest criterion in relation to a matter which involves the power of
the state to limit the rights of the individual.  I agree with the Chief
Justice that cloaking whims in judicial robes is not sufficient to satisfy the
principles of fundamental justice, and this concern is of particular weight in
matters like the decision to grant bail which involve a liberty interest. 
However, far from being an alien consideration with respect to the adjudication
of matters involving a liberty interest, consideration of the public interest
is often a necessary element of the proper articulation of the reasons for a
determination.  In Attorney-General v. Times Newspapers Ltd., [1973] 3
All E.R. 54,  the House of Lords restored an injunction on modified terms
against the proprietors of the Sunday Times restraining them from
publishing a newspaper article which related to pending litigation for the
recovery of loss caused by the drug thalidomide.   It was held that it was with
reference to the concept of the public interest that the proper considerations
ought to be weighed and evaluated. Doing so did not mean that only certain
interests would be discussed or only one side of the debate would be
considered.  Indeed, the public interest was viewed as a suitable means for
approaching both, albeit opposed, interests which were put in issue in the
litigation. As Lord Reid concluded, the proper approach to the question was as
follows (at p. 66):

 

...I
think that a balance must be struck between the public interest in freedom of
speech and the public interest in protecting the administration of justice from
interference.

 

                   The second aspect
of the context in which the criterion of public interest must be considered is
the specific context in which the provision operates.  The decision to grant
bail is one which involves a consideration of likely future conduct, and the
potential consequences for the applicant, the justice system and society of a
grant of bail.  The broad nature of these considerations makes a consideration
of the public interest appropriate.  The bearing of the public interest on a decision
regarding the liberty of a potential detainee is recognized not only in Canada,
but also in the United States.  In Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770
(1987), the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed that the proper test
for whether to stay a district court order granting relief to a petitioner
claiming habeas corpus rights, pending the state appeal, is not limited
to a consideration of the risk of flight but includes a consideration of
""where the public interest lies"" (p. 776).  Indeed, a consideration
of the context in which the Canadian provision appears suggests that the
concern that arises is not as to meaning but rather as to potential broadness.

 

                   As the Chief
Justice appropriately points out, a bail application differs from other legal determinations
in that it does not involve a finding of guilt as to past conduct. 
Consequently, the general interest of the accused in being able to be informed
of which conduct is prohibited by the law does not bear on this type of
proceeding.  A bail application is rather concerned with governing future
conduct during the interim period awaiting trial.  What is at issue are the
reasons for detention.  The criterion set by the Charter  is that of just
cause.   This implies two elements:  (1) a cause or reason and (2) a
proportionality between the reason and the deprivation of liberty that makes
the cause ""just"".  Public interest, as used in s. 515(10) , must
be understood in this context.  Under s. 515(10), two main elements exist
in relation to the operation of the public interest criterion.  One of them is
a constraint upon the type of relationship which must exist between the reasons
for a refusal to grant bail and the relevant public interest:  it must be one
of necessity.  This is reflected in s. 515(10)  by the requirement not only
of a public interest but also of necessity for the detention.  This element of
necessity involves a causal link between the public interest and the detention
such as to make the detention necessary and not merely convenient or desirable
but also an element of importance, weight or seriousness of the public interest
such as to outweigh the accused's right to personal liberty.  This necessity of
course can only be and indeed must be, by the terms of s. 515(10) (b)
itself, determined having regard to all the circumstances, that is to the full
context both of the accused and the community.  The element of seriousness of
the public interest to be considered serves to qualify the other element,
namely the content of the considerations which may be included within the
public interest criterion.  Some of these considerations may be covered by the
words, in s. 515(10) (b), ""for the protection or safety of the
public"".  The section expressly includes certain examples of relevant
matters.  It means that they should relate to the safeguarding of the
fundamental values of the rule of law and the Charter  which include the
maintaining of order and security and respect for the fundamental individual
and collective rights of others.  However, the concept of public interest is
broader than that of protection or safety of the public, and includes interests
which may not be properly included within the categories of public health or
safety.  The aim of avoiding interference with the administration of justice is
one such example.  Other examples of a public interest which have been
mentioned as having been actually experienced are the protection of the accused
himself from suicide or from the actions of others, the prevention of
activities which involve the possession of or dealing in small quantities of
illegal narcotics, or the preparation of reports for the court which require
the presence of the accused.  Also important is the consideration that the
criterion of necessity in the public interest is capable of encompassing
circumstances which have not been foreseen or, indeed, which may be
unforeseeable, yet when they occur, albeit rarely, they obviously make the
detention necessary and undoubtedly provide just cause for denying bail within
the meaning of s. 11 (e) of the Charter .  The courts must be
able to deal with such circumstances.  The good governance of society and the
rule of law itself require that Parliament be allowed to provide for social
peace and order even in unforeseen circumstances.  The appropriate instrument
for doing this is through the administration of justice by the courts and
allowing them a measure of discretion which they are bound to exercise
judicially, that is, for reasons that are relevant, within the limits provided
by law and in accordance with the Charter .  The importance and the
nature of this function of legislative provisions have been recognized by this
Court in Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, supra, at
p. 642.  It was there stated that:

 

One
must be wary of using the doctrine of vagueness to prevent or impede State
action in furtherance of valid social objectives, by requiring the law to
achieve a degree of precision to which the subject-matter does not lend
itself.  A delicate balance must be maintained between societal interests and
individual rights.  A measure of generality also sometimes allows for greater
respect for fundamental rights, since circumstances that would not justify the
invalidation of a more precise enactment may be accommodated through the
application of a more general one.

 

                   I am in full
agreement with the Chief Justice that flexibility and vagueness are not
synonymous.  The former is a quality necessary to the administration of
justice.  Section 515(10)(b) provides for this.  Its dual
requirements of public interest and necessity which itself predicates a public
interest of a serious nature have meaning, give rise to legal debate and,
though broad, are not vague but provide an adequate framework and limit for the
exercise of judicial discretion and a means for controlling such exercise while
at the same time allowing for the flexibility required for an effective
administration of justice and implementation of the rule of law.  I underline,
as does the Chief Justice in his reasons both in this case and in the case of R.
v. Pearson, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 000, that the bail process is subject to very
exacting procedural guarantees which both structure and guide the exercise of
judicial discretion.

 

                   In the result, I
would, as the Chief Justice, allow the appeal and remit the matter to the
Superior Court for a new bail review under s. 520  of the Criminal Code 
applying ss. 515(6) (a), 515(6) (d) and 515(10) (b) in
accordance with the above principles. I would answer the constitutional questions
as follows:

 

1.Does
s. 515(10)(b) of the Criminal Code , which permits the
preventive detention of an accused in the public interest or for the protection
or safety of the public, limit ss. 7 , 9 , 11 (d) and 11 (e) of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer: 
No.

 

2.If,
and to the extent the answer to this question is affirmative in whole
or in part, is s. 515(10) (b) of the Criminal Code  a
reasonable limit in a free and democratic society and justified under
s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer: 
It is not necessary to answer this question.

 

3.Do
ss. 515(6)(a) and 515(6)(d) of the Criminal Code 
limit ss. 7 , 9 , 11 (d) and 11 (e) of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer: 
No.

 

4.If
the answer to this question is affirmative, are ss. 515(6) (a) and
515(6) (d) of the Criminal Code  a reasonable limit in a free and
democratic society and justified under s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of

                   Extradition ‑‑
Extradition hearing ‑‑ Whether ""extradition crime"" must
be determined not only according to Canadian law but also according to law of
requesting state ‑‑ Whether extradition judge must determine that
the crime is listed according to the law of the requesting state ‑‑
Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑21, s. 18(1).

 

                   The respondent was
charged with conspiracy to export high‑technology equipment to the
U.S.S.R. and with having made false statements to the U.S. Department of
Commerce and the U.S. Customs Service to effect such export (File No. 21331). 
He was also indicted for knowingly and intentionally devising and participating
in a scheme to defraud a computer corporation of its right to the exclusive use
of its property regarding the design and operation of one of its computers
(File No. 21751).  The United States began extradition proceedings in Canada
pursuant to the Canada‑U.S. Treaty (Can. T.S. 1976 No. 3).  The
extradition judge in each case ordered respondent committed for extradition. 
Applications were brought for habeas corpus, where respondent argued
that the charges were not extraditable under American law.  The application
succeeded in the first case, and was upheld on appeal.  In the second case, the
chambers judge concluded that the offence was extraditable under American law,
but the Court of Appeal overturned his decision.  The respondent voluntarily
left the country but, because of the importance of the issue raised and because
respondent could arguably return to Canada, the appellant still sought the
Court's decision on these cases.

 

                   The principal issue
in these appeals was whether the offence for which extradition is sought must
be established, before the extradition judge, as being listed in the Treaty not
only according to Canadian but also according to U.S. law.  A subsidiary issue
arises if ""double listing"" is required:  whether the Court of Appeal
erred with respect to one of the indictments (File No. 21751) in concluding
that the offence charged against the respondent was not listed in the Treaty
according to the law of the United States.

                                                                    I

 

United States of America v. Charles
McVey II, also known as Charles Julius McVey, File No. 21331

 

                   The Act and the
Treaty jointly determine a scheme which governs this extradition proceeding. 
Under that scheme, the role of the extradition judge is limited, but
important:  he or she must determine whether a prima facie case exists
that the conduct of the fugitive constitutes an ""extradition crime""
according to Canadian law.  The Act and the Treaty do not assign to the judge
the task of determining whether it also constitutes an extradition crime under
foreign law.  That is a matter for the American authorities, subject to being
monitored by the Canadian executive in determining whether the requisition for
surrender complies with the terms of the Treaty.

 

                   The principles and
rules governing extradition must be found in the Extradition Act  and
treaties; abstract principles of extradition law do not have independent
force.  Our Act is modelled after the British statute, and as such the law and
practice of that country is of persuasive value on the issue in this appeal.

 

                   In our Act, an
""extradition crime"" is any crime that, if committed in Canada, would
be one of the crimes listed in the Act or relevant treaty.  The Act does not
require proof that the act charged is a crime under the foreign law; rather, s. 34
requires that the list of crimes be construed according to Canadian law.  The
crime as it is known in the foreign state is set forth in the information and
warrant of arrest, and this leaves it up to the Canadian authorities,
ordinarily the extradition judge, to identify the equivalent Canadian crime.

 

                   Section 15 of the
Act recognizes the possibility that a treaty may restrict the term
""extradition crime"".  But s. 15 only gives the extradition judge
jurisdiction to receive evidence on the matter, which under s. 19(b)
the judge must transmit to the Minister for consideration.  It is not intended
by the Act that the extradition judge monitor all the many and variegated
conditions, qualifications and restrictions to which states, through their
extradition treaties, have qualified their obligations to other states to
surrender fugitive criminals.  This could lead to endless delays in a procedure
intended to be expeditious, and the courts should not reach out to bring within
their jurisdictional ambit matters that the Act has not assigned to them. 
Barring statutory provision, the task of monitoring international treaty
obligations is for the political authorities, a task performed by the Ministers
and departments in the course of conducting their appropriate mandates.  By statute
this duty is assigned to the Minister of Justice.

 

                   Turning to the
treaty at issue here, none of its terms is inconsistent with the Act's
stipulations that the extradition judge should be concerned solely with
Canadian law.  Nothing in the Treaty requires proof of foreign law at the
extradition hearing, and the isolated provisions that invoke the law of the
requesting state are merely to assist the executive in its duty of ensuring
that the requesting state has complied with the terms of the Treaty.

 

                   Although the
function of the extradition hearing is a modest one, it is critical to the
liberty of the individual.  And there are other protections afforded the
fugitive.  The Treaty provides that the person surrendered shall only be
detained and tried in the requesting country for the offence for which his or
her surrender was made.  The courts of both countries deal with the offence
under their own law, the law in which they are versed, but each must ascertain
whether under that law the facts support the charge.  To require evidence of
foreign law beyond the documents now supplied with the requisition could
cripple the operation of extradition proceedings.

 

                   Canadian
authorities on this issue have long been in a state of confusion, due in part
to the early English practice of obtaining proof of foreign law in extradition
hearings.  It is now settled in England, however, that the extradition judge,
absent statutory provision, is not concerned with foreign law at all. 
Consistent with the English authorities, recent cases in this Court also
indicate that the sole question for the extradition judge is whether the
conduct of the fugitive would, if committed here, constitute an extradition
crime under Canadian law.

 

                   The provisions in
this Treaty concerning the law of the requesting state, in particular
Art. 2(1) requiring the crime to be punishable by at least a one year
sentence under the law of both states, do not alter the role of the extradition
judge.  Article 2 does not deal with judicial hearings but with the duty of the
executive to deliver the fugitive according to the provisions of the Treaty. 
Interpreting this provision as having some impact on the extradition hearing
ignores the fact that treaties are contracts between sovereign states that,
except to the extent that a treaty requires a change in the law of the land,
are administered by the executive and its officials.

 

                   The evidence of
American law in this case was not only irrelevant; it was also misplaced.  The
issue is not whether the crime charged is called forgery or not in either
country, but whether the conduct charged can fairly be said to fall within the
expressions ""forgery"" and ""conspiracy"" in the treaty.  The
crimes in the treaty are not to be interpreted according to the niceties of the
applicable legislation in either country.  Rather they are described in a
comprehensive and generic sense:  it is the essence of the offence that is
important.  If the American authorities proceeded on too broad a basis, the
matter could be raised at the diplomatic level.  However, it would lie ill in
the mouth of Canada to say to the United States that the act charged in this
case does not fall within the genus of forgery when in this country it falls
within the definition of forgery under Canadian law.

 

                                                                    II

 

United States of America v. Charles
Julius McVey, File
No. 21751

 

                   For the reasons
noted above, the extradition judge in this second case need not have concerned
himself with the question of whether the extradition crime was listed in the
treaty according to the law of the United States.  Once the appellant
established a prima facie case of an extradition crime according to the
law of Canada, the extradition judge was required to surrender the respondent
under s. 18(1) (b) of the Extradition Act , read in conjunction
with s. 2  (the definition of an ""extradition crime"") and
s. 34 .  Given the protections available to the fugitive under the Act and
the Treaty, there is no point to a review of foreign law by the extradition
judge.  It is not the business of that judge to assume responsibility for
reviewing the decisions of the officials and judicial authorities in the
foreign state.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka and
McLachlin JJ. (dissenting)

 

                                                                I
& II

 

United States of America v. Charles
McVey II, also known as Charles Julius McVey, File No. 21331 and United States of America
v. Charles Julius McVey, File No. 21751

 

                   Under the Canada‑U.S.
Treaty as it stood when these proceedings were commenced, the extradition judge
must be satisfied that the offence for which extradition is sought is listed in
the Schedule to the Treaty according to the law of the United States and of
Canada.

 

                   The concept of an
""extradition crime"" is central to the task of the extradition judge. 
Under s. 18(1)(b) of the Act, the judge shall issue a warrant for
committal where the evidence justifies, under Canadian law, the committal of a
fugitive accused of an ""extradition crime"" as if the crime had been
committed in Canada.  This same standard of proof is provided for in
Art. 10 of the Treaty.  The extradition judge must receive any evidence
tendered to show that the crime of which the fugitive is accused is an offence
of a political character or is, for any other reason, not an extradition crime.

 

                   The combination of
Arts. 1 and 2 of the treaty requires that the fugitive be charged with an
offence in the United States that is listed in the schedule.  If the same
conduct amounts to different offences in the two countries, they must both be
listed.  This conclusion is confirmed by the interaction of Arts. 2 and
12.  A fugitive cannot be prosecuted for any offence other than an offence
listed in the Schedule.  Since a fugitive extradited to the United States will
only be prosecuted for offences against U.S. law, the offence which forms the
basis of the extradition request must therefore be an offence listed in the
Treaty according to U.S. law.  The same reasoning applies where no treaty is
relied on.

 

                   Article 8 of the
Treaty, which provides that the determination that extradition should or should
not be granted shall be made in accordance with the law of the requested state,
does not preclude reference to the law of the requesting state.  Proceedings
can be conducted in accordance with Canadian law even though there is an issue
as to what the law of the United States is on a particular point.  Such a
situation is not unique to the law of extradition.

 

                   A double listing
requirement is consistent with both Art. 8 and the introductory words of
the Canada‑United States Treaty.  It ensures that Canada only extradites
in situations where Canada could successfully request extradition if the same
conduct had taken place here and the fugitive had fled to the United States.

 

                   Since an
extradition crime here is one listed in the Schedule to the Treaty according to
the laws of both Canada and the United States, the extradition judge must
determine if this requirement has been met before issuing a warrant of
committal under s. 18 of the Act.  It is not for the requesting state to
determine whether the act for which a fugitive is sought is a crime in the
requesting state for which it may seek surrender under the treaty.

 

                   Although the
extradition judge has a limited role, the concept of an ""extradition
crime"" or a crime that falls within the appropriate treaty is central to
his or her task.  The extradition judge must determine that the double listing
requirement is met.  Section 15 of the Act requires the judge to receive
evidence tendered to show that the crime of which the fugitive is accused is,
for any reason, not an extradition crime.

 

                   Requiring
determination of whether an offence is listed according to the requesting
state's law would not unduly lengthen and unnecessarily complicate
proceedings.  Proof of foreign law is often a component of private law
litigation and has not slowed such proceedings to a halt.  Moreover in the
majority of extradition cases, this issue will be uncontentious and will be
resolved on the basis of the text of the provision under which the fugitive was
charged or convicted and accompanying affidavits.

 

                   The issue in File
No. 21751 was not whether the injured corporation was a member of the
public but whether an accused could be convicted in the United States of using
the telephone in connection with a scheme to defraud the public when the scheme
was aimed at one corporation.  No evidence was led on that issue which was an
essential precondition to the issuance of a warrant under s. 18.  The
extradition judge was therefore without jurisdiction to issue the warrant.

//Sopinka J.//

 

                   Sopinka
J. (dissenting) -- These
appeals concern the requirements for extradition pursuant to the Extradition
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑21, now R.S.C., 1985, c. E‑23
(""the Act"") and the Extradition Treaty between Canada and the
United States of America, Can. T.S. 1976 No. 3 (""the
Treaty"").  Specifically, the issue is whether it must be established
before the extradition judge that the offence for which extradition is sought
is listed in the Treaty according to the law of the United States as well as
according to Canadian law.  A subsidiary issue, if ""double listing""
is required, is whether the Court of Appeal erred with respect to one of the
indictments which is the subject of this appeal, in concluding that the offence
charged against the respondent was not listed in the Treaty according to the
law of the United States.

 

                   I cannot agree with
the interpretation of the Act and the Treaty which my colleague Justice La
Forest proposes in his reasons.  I also reach a different result.  The facts
and history of the proceedings are fully dealt with in the reasons of my
colleague and I am able to proceed directly to the issues.

 

I.  Issues

 

                   The United States
appeals from both judgments of the British Columbia Court of Appeal.  The
principal issue, which arises on both appeals, can be stated as follows:

 

Before
a warrant of committal is issued by an extradition judge, must it be
established that the offence for which extradition is sought is one that is
listed in the Schedule to the Treaty according to the law of the United States
as well as according to Canadian law?

 

This is the only basis on which the
United States challenges the Court of Appeal's decision in relation to the Los
Angeles charges.  With respect to the San Jose charges, however, if this
question is answered in the affirmative, a second issue arises, namely, whether
the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the offence charged against the
respondent did not fall within the crimes listed in the Schedule to the Treaty
according to the law of the United States.  Given my resolution of these two
issues, I do not find it necessary to deal with a number of additional issues
raised by the respondent.

jurisdiction, would be one of the crimes described in Schedule I; and, in the
application of this Act to the case of any extradition arrangement,
""extradition crime"" means any crime described in such arrangement,

state with which there is an extradition arrangement, this Part applies during
the continuance of such arrangement; but no provision of this Part that is
inconsistent with any of the terms of the arrangement has effect to contravene

III.  Analysis

 

1.  Double Criminality
and Listing

 

                   The Approach

 

                   The extradition of
fugitive criminals from Canada is governed by the Extradition Act .  As a
result of s. 3 of the Act, where there is an extradition arrangement,
which includes a treaty, in place with any foreign state, the Act must be read and
construed to provide for the execution of the arrangement, and the arrangement
takes precedence over any provision of the Act that is inconsistent with it. 
Thus the resolution of the issue in this case turns on an analysis of the
relevant provisions of the Act and the Canada‑United States Treaty.  The
Court's task is not to establish what it would consider to be the ideal
extradition arrangement between Canada and the United States, but to interpret
the scheme existing at the time when these extradition proceedings were
commenced.  That the correct approach is treaty‑specific has been
recognized by courts in several jurisdictions.  In Riley v. Commonwealth of
Australia (1985), 62 A.L.R. 497 (H.C. Aust.), Gibbs C.J. observed
at p. 504:

 

It
was held by the Supreme Court of the United States in Factor v. Laubenheimer
(1933) 290 US 276, 78 Law Ed 315, that the nature and extent of the
right to demand extradition and the duty to extradite depend on the terms of
the Treaty which creates the right and the duty rather than on the principles
of international law:  see at p 287 (p 320 of Law Ed).  Lord
Diplock appears to have proceeded on the basis of a similar view in Re
Nielsen, [1984] A.C. 606 at pp. 624‑5.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   We must not lose
sight of the fact that extradition treaties, although they are arrangements
between governments, affect the liberty of individuals.  Many of these
individuals are citizens of Canada who, by virtue of s. 6(1)  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , have the constitutional right to remain in
Canada unless taken away by law which meets the test of s. 1  of the Charter . 
See United States of America v. Cotroni, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1469.  If
the parties to the treaty are of the view that the arrangement is not achieving
its purpose in bringing criminals to justice, they are free to amend the
treaty.  In this regard, I note that, since this appeal was heard, amendments
to the Canada‑United States Treaty replacing the Schedule of offences
with a provision for extradition for ""conduct which constitutes an offence
punishable by the laws of both Contracting Parties by imprisonment or other
form of detention for a term exceeding one year or any greater
punishment"", have come into force (Can. T.S. 1991 No. 37,
Art. 1 ).

 

The
Scheme Established by the Extradition Act  and the Canada‑United
States Treaty

 

                   The essence of the
appellant's position which my colleague accepts is this.  Extradition from
Canada is exclusively a creature of statute and the treaty.  These instruments
define under what conditions a person is extraditable.  There are basically two
requirements.  It must be established that the fugitive is charged with or has
been convicted of an offence that is a listed crime under the law of (1) the
requesting state and (2) the requested state.  The Act provides for a hearing
to determine whether the fugitive is extraditable, but while it can determine
whether the second requirement is met, it cannot deal with the first
requirement.  The determination of this aspect of extraditability is
exclusively the prerogative of authorities in the prosecuting state.  This
strikes me as somewhat unusual in that a citizen of Canada who is accused of a
crime that may not exist in the United States must suffer apprehension and be
sent out of the country before he or she is able to address the first of the
two requirements stipulated by the treaty.  I have no doubt that such a result
can be achieved by appropriate language.  In my opinion, however, this treaty
cannot bear this interpretation.

 

                   The task of the
extradition judge faced with a request for extradition by a foreign state is
set out in s. 18 of the Act.  Under s. 18(1)(b), the judge
shall issue a warrant for committal in the case of a fugitive accused of an
""extradition crime"", if such evidence is produced as would, according
to the law of Canada, justify his committal for trial, if the crime had been
committed in Canada.  This same standard of proof is provided for in Article 10
of the Treaty.  A ""fugitive"" is defined in s. 2 of the Act as a
person in or suspected of being in Canada, who is accused or convicted of an
extradition crime committed within the jurisdiction of the foreign state. 
Section 15 provides that the judge shall receive any evidence tendered to show
that the crime of which the fugitive is accused is an offence of a political
character or is, for any other reason, not an extradition crime.  The
centrality of the concept of an ""extradition crime"" to the task of
the extradition judge is thus evident.  Under s. 18 of the Act, it is only
with respect to such crimes that an extradition judge can issue a warrant of
committal.

 

                   ""Extradition
crime"" is defined in s. 2.  Where there is an applicable extradition
arrangement, it means any crime described in such arrangement.  It is therefore
necessary to turn to the terms of the Treaty.  In art. 1, the parties
agree to extradite persons who have been charged with, or convicted of, any of
the offences covered by art. 2.  It is clear that in the case of an
individual being sought for extradition from Canada to the United States, the
offence in respect of which he has been charged or convicted is an offence
against United States law.  This is confirmed by reference to the warrant of
committal that must be completed by an extradition judge when the requirements
of s. 18 are satisfied (Schedule II, Form Two).  It states in part:

 

. .
. and forasmuch as I have determined that he should be surrendered in pursuance
of the said Act, on the ground of his being accused (or convicted) of
the crime of ................... within the jurisdiction of ..................
.   

 

Therefore ""offenses covered by
Article 2 of this Treaty"" must encompass the requirement that they are
covered by Art. 2 according to United States law.  Article 2(1)
provides that persons shall be delivered up according to the terms of the
Treaty for:

 

...
any of the offenses listed in the Schedule annexed to this Treaty...
provided these offenses are punishable by the laws of both Contracting Parties
by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.

 

The combination of Arts. 1 and 2
therefore requires that an offence of which the fugitive is accused be listed
in the Schedule in order to found a request for extradition.  Since the
fugitive is accused of an offence under United States law, that offence must be
listed in the schedule.  If the same conduct amounts to different offences in
the two countries, they must both be listed.

 

                   The interaction of
Arts. 2 and 12 of the treaty confirms this conclusion.  Article 12
prevents the prosecution of a fugitive for any ""offense other than that
for which extradition has been granted"".  This provision constitutes an
important protection for the fugitive.  Article 2(1) states that person shall
only be delivered up ""for any of the offenses listed in the
Schedule"".  The combination of these two provisions means that a fugitive
cannot be prosecuted for any offence other than an offence listed in the
Schedule.  Since a fugitive extradited to the United States will only be
prosecuted for offences against United States law, this leads to the conclusion
that the offence which forms the basis of the extradition request must be an
offence which is listed in the Treaty according to the law of the United
States.

 

                   There is nothing in
Buck v. The King (1917), 55 S.C.R. 133, or United States v.
Rauscher, 119 U.S. 407 (1886), which is inconsistent with these
observations.  The passages from those cases relied on by my colleague require
that the accused be tried with respect to the specific offence with which he
was charged, not the ""offence for which his surrender was made"" as
suggested by my colleague.  It is apparent that the offences are those in the requesting
state.  Thus, in Buck v. The King, in which Canada was the requesting
state, the accused could only be tried for the offence for which he was
extradited from the United States, that offence having been identified by its
Canadian label, a charge under s. 414  of the Criminal Code .

 

                   The same reasoning
would apply where no treaty is relied on.  Under s. 18(1)(b), the
judge must determine whether the fugitive is accused of an extradition crime as
defined in s. 2 of the Act.  That definition refers to ""any crime
that, if committed in Canada, or within Canadian jurisdiction would be one of
the crimes described in Schedule I"" (emphasis added).  ""Any
crime"" must refer to the crime of which the fugitive is accused.  If it is
not a crime, then it is not an extradition crime, and the fact that it satisfies
the balance of the definition is irrelevant.

 

                   The appellant
submits that this conclusion runs contrary to art. 8 of the Treaty which
provides that the determination that extradition should or should not be
granted shall be made in accordance with the law of the requested state, in
this case, Canada.  Similar language is found in ss. 18 and 34 of the
Act.  I do not agree that this provision precludes reference to the law of
the requesting state.  Proceedings can be conducted in accordance with Canadian
law even though there is an issue as to what the law of the United States is on
a particular point.  Such a situation is not unique to the law of extradition. 
Moreover it is evident from the rest of the Treaty that these provisions do not
preclude reference to the law of the requesting state.  For example,
Art. 2(1) requires reference to the law of both states in order to
ascertain that an offence is punishable by greater than one year's imprisonment
in each state.  In order to make this determination, an extradition judge must
first determine what particular offence the fugitive's alleged conduct
constitutes in each state.  It would be strange for a judge to find that an
offence was ""punishable by laws"" of the requesting state when in
reality no offence in law existed.  A further example is provided by
art. 2(3) which states:

 

(3)  Extradition
shall also be granted for any offense against a federal law of the United
States in which one of the offenses listed in the annexed Schedule . . . is a
substantial element . . . .

 

A determination of whether the
requirements of this article are met clearly requires analysis of the United
States law in question in order to determine whether the listed offence is a
substantial element of it.  Thus I would conclude that a double listing
requirement is not inconsistent with art. 8.

 

                   Finally, I note
that a double listing requirement is consistent with the introductory words of
the Canada‑United States Treaty which provide that:

 

                   Canada
and the United States of America, desiring to make more effective the co‑operation
of the two countries in the repression of crime by making provision for the reciprocal
extradition of offenders, agree as follows:  [Emphasis added.]

 

A double listing requirement ensures
that Canada only extradites in situations where Canada could successfully
request extradition if the same conduct had taken place here and the fugitive
had fled to the United States.

 

                   Relevant
Authorities

 

                   Although the
precise issue of double listing was not before the Court in Washington
(State of) v. Johnson, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 327, Wilson J. writing for the
majority, at p. 339, framed the issue in that case in terms consistent
with my conclusion that an extradition crime must be listed in the Treaty
according to the law of both the United States and Canada:

 

                   The
central issue to be addressed in determining the nature of the double
criminality rule is whether the rule requires the elements of the extradition
crime to be the same in the requesting and the requested state or whether it
merely requires the act charged to be a listed crime in both countries. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

Wilson J. concluded at p. 342
that the double criminality rule was ""conduct‑based"" by which
she meant that an exact identity between the offence charged in the requesting
state and the Canadian offence was not required, and that:

 

. .
. if it could be established that the conduct of the fugitive
constituted the listed offence of theft in both Canada and Washington the
double criminality requirement would be met.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   In coming to this
conclusion Wilson J. cited, with apparent approval, the definition of
extradition crime given by G. V. La Forest in his text Extradition To and
From Canada (2nd ed. 1977), at p. 42:

 

An
extradition crime may broadly be defined as an act of which a person is
accused, or has been convicted, of having committed within the jurisdiction of
one state that constitutes a crime in that state and in the state where that
person is found, and that is mentioned or described in an extradition treaty
between those states under a name or description by which it is known in each
state.  This definition can be broken down into several propositions:

 

(1)the
act charged must have been committed within the jurisdiction of the demanding
state;

 

(2)it
must be a crime in the demanding state;

 

(3)it
must also be a crime in the requested state; and

 

(4)it
must be listed in an extradition treaty between the two states under some name
or description by which it is known in each state.  [Emphasis added.]

 

In the most recent edition of that
work, A. W. La Forest, La Forest's Extradition to and From Canada
(3rd ed. 1991), the above definition is restated (at p. 49).  The fourth
proposition is expanded upon as follows, at p. 74:

 

                   In
addition to satisfying the requirement that the act charged must be a crime in
both countries, it must also amount to a crime listed in the treaty between the
two countries, and if the act charged falls within the definition of different
crimes in the two countries, the names of the crimes in both countries must
appear in the treaty.

 

The author also refers to the decision
of the Ontario County Court in Re United States of America and Smith
(1984), 15 C.C.C. (3d) 16 (aff'd (1984), 16 C.C.C. (3d) 10 (H.C.J.)), in which
Borins Co. Ct. J. stated at p. 27:

 

If
the conduct discloses an offence established by the law of Canada, and if that
offence is among the offences enumerated in the Schedule to the extradition
treaty, and if the offence alleged to have been committed contrary to the
laws of the demanding State is also enumerated in the Schedule, then a case
for extradition has been made out.  [Emphasis added.]

 

There is thus support, both academic
and judicial, for my conclusion that double listing is required under this
Treaty.  A number of other cases which might appear to support the contrary
conclusion require comment.  In United States v. Allard, [1991] 1 S.C.R.
861, La Forest J. writing for the Court, drew attention to s. 34 of the
Act which provides:

 

                   34.  The list of crimes set out
in Schedule I shall be construed according to the law existing in Canada at the
date of the commission of the alleged crime, whether by common law or by
statute, and as including only such crimes, of the description comprised in the
list, as are indictable offences under that law.

 

He noted that according to its terms
s. 34 applies only to crimes listed in Schedule I of the Act, however
he stated that the general principle articulated by this provision was apparent
and that it would be odd if a different rule were applied to crimes listed in
Schedule I than those mentioned in a treaty.  In my view, neither s. 34
nor Allard address the issue of whether double listing is required under
the Canada‑United States Treaty.  The issue under consideration in that
case was whether the treaty applied to a crime which did not exist under
Canadian law when it was committed in the requesting state.  The Court's focus
was therefore on what was required in terms of the Canadian law.  The
question of whether the alleged conduct also had to constitute a listed
crime according to United States law was not considered since it was not
disputed that the alleged conduct constituted the listed offence of hijacking a
plane according to United States law.

 

                   The other cases
which require consideration are the decisions of the House of Lords in In Re
Nielsen, [1984] A.C. 606, and United States Government v. McCaffery,
[1984] 2 All E.R. 570.  In Nielsen, the House of Lords held that under
the Extradition Act, 1870 in order to determine whether alleged conduct
constitutes an ""extradition crime"", a magistrate need only inquire as
to whether the conduct, according to English law, fell within one of the crimes
listed in the schedule to the Act, and had no jurisdiction to inquire into or
receive evidence of the substantive criminal law of the foreign state in which
the conduct was committed.  However in reaching this conclusion, Lord Diplock
recognized that the issue turned on the construction of the Act and/or Treaty
in question.  He stated at pp. 618 and 621:

 

[T]he
definitions of ""extradition crime"", ""fugitive criminal"",
""fugitive criminal of a foreign state"" and ""warrant"" in
section 26  of the Extradition Act  1870, read in conjunction with the
introductory words of Schedule 1 which require the description of each listed
crime to be construed according to the law existing in England at the date of
the alleged crime, are all‑important. 

 

                                                                   . . .

 

                   In
the principal treaty with Denmark, the list of crimes in respect of which
surrender of fugitive criminals will be granted is confined to those contained
in the 1870 list, and it was for crimes within this list alone that the
Secretary of State's orders to proceed in the instant case were made.  That is
the reason why the magistrate had not, in my view, any jurisdiction in the
instant case to make any findings of fact as to Danish substantive criminal law
or to hear expert evidence about it.  

 

He made it clear, at p. 621, that in
the face of a different Act or Treaty, the opposite conclusion was possible:

 

                   It
would have been otherwise if the conduct of which Nielsen was accused in
Denmark had not been covered by any description of an English crime in the 1870
list but had been added to the list of extradition crimes by later Extradition
Acts.  For, in that event, it would only have been brought into the list of
extradition crimes applicable to fugitive criminals from Denmark by the
supplementary treaty of 1936 of which the relevant provision is the addition to
article I of the principal treaty of the words:

 

""Extradition
may also be granted at the discretion of the High Contracting Party applied to
in respect of any other crime or offence for which, according to the laws of both
[emphasis by Lord Diplock] of the High Contracting Parties for the time being
in force, the grant may be made.""

 

Had
it been necessary for the Danish Government to rely upon the supplementary
treaty it would have been necessary for the magistrate to hear evidence of
Danish law in order to satisfy himself that the conduct of the accused in
addition to constituting in English law an extradition crime included among
those subsequently added to the 1870 list, also constituted an offence that was
treated as an extradition crime in Denmark.

 

                   Whether
in an accusation case the police magistrate has any jurisdiction to make
findings as to the substantive criminal law of the foreign state by which the
requisition for surrender of a fugitive criminal is made will depend upon the
terms of the arrangement made in the extradition treaty with that state. 
Some treaties may contain provisions that limit surrender to persons accused of
conduct that constitutes a crime of a particular kind (for example, one that
attracts specified minimum penalties) in both England and the foreign state. 
Accusation cases arising under extradition treaties that contain this kind of
limitation I shall call ``exceptional accusation cases''.  In an exceptional
accusation case it will be necessary for the police magistrate to hear expert
evidence of the substantive criminal law of the foreign state and make his own
findings of fact about it. [Emphasis added.]

 

In McCaffery the House of Lords
applied its judgment in Nielsen to a case concerning the extradition
treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States.  Lord Diplock held
that this treaty brought the proceedings within the category of exceptional
accusation cases since it expressly required that the offence be punishable
under the laws of both parties by imprisonment for more than a year or by the
death penalty, and that the offence constitute a felony under United States
law.  Evidence of United States law on these two points was thus required. 
Evidence was not required that the alleged offences were listed under the Extradition
Acts 1870 to 1935 or the United Kingdom‑United States Treaty
according to American law, however this must be considered in light of
Art. III of that Treaty which provides:

 

                   (1)  Extradition
shall be granted for an act or omission the facts of which disclose an offence
within any of the descriptions listed in the Schedule annexed to this Treaty,
which is an integral part of the Treaty, or any other offence, if:... (b)
the offence is extraditable under the relevant law, being the law of the
United Kingdom or other territory to which this Treaty applies by virtue of
sub‑paragraph (1)(a) of Article II...

 

Thus, in my view, these English cases
can be distinguished on their facts.  Both cases involved provisions that
expressly stated that the law to apply in determining whether an offence was
extraditable was English law.  No such provision appears in the Canada‑United
States Treaty, and as I have discussed supra, several provisions of that
Treaty suggest that to constitute an extradition crime thereunder, the alleged
conduct must fall within one of the listed offences according to United States
law.

 

                   Jurisdiction of
the Extradition Judge

 

                   Having concluded
that under the extradition arrangement in place between Canada and the United
States when these proceedings were commenced, an extradition crime is one which
is listed in the Schedule to the Treaty according to the laws of both Canada
and the United States, it would seem to flow logically that this requirement
must be determined by an extradition judge before a warrant of committal can be
issued under s. 18 of the Act.  However it has been suggested that an
extradition judge has no jurisdiction to engage in this inquiry.  In La
Forest's Extradition to and From Canada, 3rd ed., after reproducing a
passage from Re United States of America and Smith, supra, on the
task of the extradition judge, the author writes at p. 54:

 

                   A
slight, but important, caveat must be added.  The clause indicating that the
crime as known in the requesting state must appear in the treaty is correct,
but the statement should not be taken to mean that this is a matter to be
determined by the extradition judge.  That would require proof of foreign law,
which is beyond the jurisdiction of the extradition judge:  (Re Neilsen,
[1984] 1 A.C. 606 (H.L.)).  Rather, it is for the requesting state to determine
whether the act for which a fugitive is sought is a crime in that state for
which it may seek surrender under the treaty.  All the Act empowers the
extradition judge to do is to determine whether the act charged is an
extradition crime according to the law of Canada. 

 

I cannot agree with this position.  In
Argentina v. Mellino, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 536, La Forest J. writing for the
majority, explained the function of the extradition judge at p. 553:

 

[T]he
modest function of an extradition hearing... (barring minimal statutory and
treaty exceptions) is merely to determine whether the relevant crime falls
within the appropriate treaty and whether the evidence presented is
sufficient to justify the executive surrendering the fugitive to the requesting
country for trial there.  Responsibility for the conduct of our foreign
relations, including the performance of Canada's obligations under extradition
treaties, is, of course, vested in the executive.  I repeat: the role of the
extradition judge is a modest one; absent express statutory or treaty
authorization, the sole purpose of an extradition hearing is to ensure that the
evidence establishes a prima facie case that the extradition crime
has been committed.  [Emphasis added.]

 

 

                   In La Forest's
Extradition To and From Canada, 2nd ed., in the passage at p. 42 to
which I referred earlier which was approved by Wilson J. in Washington
(State of) v. Johnson, supra, at p. 340, ""extradition
crime"" is defined to include as two of its four elements the following:

 

(2)
it must be a crime in the demanding state;

 

                                                                   . . .

 

(4)it
must be listed in an extradition treaty between the two states under some name
or description by which it is known in each state.

 

                   I am in full
agreement that the extradition judge has a limited role. However, as these
passages make clear, the concept of an ""extradition crime"" or a crime
that falls within the appropriate treaty is central to his or her task.  These
passages also affirm that in the context of the Canada‑United States
Treaty, ""extradition crime"" includes the requirement that the crime
be an offence in the United States and listed in the Treaty according to United
States law.  If that requirement is not met, then the extradition judge has no
jurisdiction to issue a warrant for committal under s. 18 of the Act. 
That the extradition judge must determine that the double criminality and
listing requirements are met is confirmed by s. 15 of the Act which
requires the judge to receive evidence tendered to show that the crime of which
the fugitive is accused is, for any reason, not an extradition crime.

 

                   Nor is Nielsen
authority for the general proposition that proof of foreign law is beyond the
jurisdiction of the extradition judge.  On the contrary, the House of Lords in Nielsen
and McCaffery specifically acknowledged that under some Acts and
Treaties an extradition judge may be required to inquire into and hear evidence
of the substantive criminal law of the requesting state.  While some doubt may
have been cast on this position in England by the recent decision in Sinclair
v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1991] 2 All E.R. 366 (H.L.), that case
reiterates that one of the functions of the extradition judge is to determine
that he or she is dealing with an ""extradition crime"" (at
p. 378).  Where an ""extradition crime"" includes a requirement
relating to the law of the requesting state, I do not see how it can be beyond
the jurisdiction of the extradition judge to consider such law.

 

                   Pragmatic
Considerations

 

                   The final argument
proffered against requiring extradition judges to determine whether an offence
is listed according to the requesting state's law is that it would unduly
lengthen and unnecessarily complicate and delay proceedings.  This argument is
well summarized in the following passage from La Forest's Extradition to and
From Canada, 3rd ed., at p. 170:

 

It
could slow the system of extradition proceedings to a halt if foreign expert
witnesses had to be called on a regular basis to ensure that extradition judges
become ""instant experts"" in foreign law, especially if the crime
occurred in a country with a legal system and language different from our own. 
Documentary evidence might suffice in some cases, for it has been held that
proof can be made by authenticated affidavits or depositions in the same manner
as the facts of the case are established.  But this is not always satisfactory
....  

 

Quite apart from the fact that I have
concluded that an extradition judge must engage in such an inquiry in
order to determine whether he can issue a warrant under s. 18, I do not
find these concerns compelling.  Proof of foreign law is often a component of
private law litigation.  This practice has not slowed such proceedings to a
halt.  Moreover in the majority of extradition cases, this issue will be
uncontentious and will be resolved on the basis of the text of the provision
under which the fugitive was charged or convicted and accompanying affidavits. 
The current practice in Canada, which has prevailed for many years, is that the
extradition judge examines the law with respect to the offence alleged to have
been committed in the requesting state.  See M. C. Blanchflower,
""Examination of the Law of the Requesting State in Extradition
Proceedings"" (1992), 34 Crim L.Q. 277, and ""Interpretation and
Application of Extradition Crime in the Extradition Act "" (1992), 34 Crim.
L.Q. 158, at pp. 173‑74.  There is no evidence to support the
conclusion that this practice has slowed extradition proceedings to a halt. 
Furthermore, the practice appears to be the same in the United States when
Canada is the requesting state.  See Buck v. The King, supra, as
an example.  At page 149, the judgment of Anglin J., on which my
colleague relies, refers to the fact that the evidence before the Extradition
Commissioner in the United States included ""proof of the Canadian
law"".

 

                   Conclusion

 

                   I would therefore
conclude that under the Canada‑United States Treaty as it stood when
these proceedings were commenced, it was necessary to establish before the
extradition judge that the offence for which extradition was sought was listed
in the Schedule to the Treaty according to the law of the United States as well
as according to Canadian law.  This is a sufficient basis on which to dismiss
the United States' appeal on the Los Angeles charges (Appeal No. 21331). 
However in relation to the San Jose charges (Appeal No. 21751), the United
States makes an alternative argument, namely that the Court of Appeal erred in
ruling that the offence charged against the respondent did not fall within the
Treaty according to the law of the United States.  I therefore turn to this
issue.

 

2.Are
the San Jose Charges Offences Listed in the Treaty According to U.S. Law?

 

                   The San Jose
charges were laid under 18 U.S.C. {ss} 1343, which provides:

 

                   Whoever,
having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for
obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of
wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any
writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such
scheme or artifice, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more
than five years, or both.

 

The respondent was charged that he did
with others:

 

. .
. knowingly devise and intend to devise and participate in a scheme and
artifice to defraud the Saxpy Computer Corporation of:

 

A.  its
right to the exclusive use of its property, to wit, confidential, proprietary
information regarding the design and operation of the Saxpy Matrix‑1
Super Computer, and

 

B.  its
right to the loyal, honest, faithful and promised services of its employees,
free from fraud, stealth and self‑dealing,

 

and that:

 

. .
. for the purpose of executing the aforesaid scheme and attempting to do so,
did knowingly transmit and cause to be transmitted in interstate and foreign
commerce by wire communication... certain signs, signals and sounds, to wit, a
telephone call.

 

                   In the courts
below, the appellant took the position that the charges fell within paragraph
27 of the Schedule to the Treaty according to U.S. law:

 

27.Use
of the mails or other means of communication in connection with schemes devised
or intended to deceive or defraud the public or for the purpose of obtaining
money or property by false pretenses.

 

In his affidavit, the expert witness
called by the appellant, Mr. Leland Altschuler, had initially taken the
position that the crime alleged in the indictment came within paragraph 12 of
the Schedule:

 

12. Obtaining
property, money or valuable securities by false pretenses or by threat or force
or by defrauding the public or any person by deceit or falsehood or other
fraudulent means, whether such deceit or falsehood or any fraudulent means
would or would not amount to a false pretense.

 

However, as the Court of Appeal
stated:

 

                   During
his cross‑examination Altschuler appeared to abandon clause 12.  Amongst
other things he said that ""I believe the best paragraph would be number 27
to the Treaty and schedule"".  Subsequent to the hearing of the appeal, we
enquired whether the United States no longer placed any reliance on clause 12
of the Schedule.  By letter dated October 31, 1989 Miss Tobias advised us that
""the [United States] relies exclusively on Item 27 of the Schedule to the
Treaty.""

 

                   The issue then is
whether the offence charged against the respondent falls within paragraph 27
according to American law.  Paragraph 27 requires that the scheme be to defraud
""the public"".  This can be contrasted with paragraph 12 which refers
to ""the public or any person"".  In this case, the respondent was
charged with engaging in a scheme to defraud a particular individual, the Saxpy
Computer Corporation.  In cross‑examination, Mr. Altschuler was
questioned as to whether the offence charged included as an element, defrauding
the public:

 

Q.Now,
Mr. Altschuler, with regards to the crime charged in part 5, it alleges
the crime against the United ‑‑ citizens of United States of
America the Saxpy Corporation, is that not so?

 

A.The
victim, if you will, in this crime is the Saxpy Computer Corporation.  The
action, of course, is prosecuted by the United States.

 

Q.No,
but it alleges a crime, a fraud against the Saxpy Computer Corporation, a
private individual?

 

A.Yes. 
Well, we would say that Saxpy is the victim of the fraud, but I suspect we are
saying the same thing.

 

Q.Indeed. 
It is not a fraud against the public of the United States, it is a fraud
against an individual in the United States, is that not so, sir?

 

A.Yes.

 

Q.Paragraph
27, sir, of the schedule requires the:  ""Use of mails or other means of
communication in connection with schemes devised or intended to deceive or
defraud the public...""  If I stop there, you will agree with me that that
doesn't apply here because this wasn't a crime to defraud the public?

 

A.That's
right, this was not a crime to defraud the public.

 

Later in his testimony
Mr. Altschuler gave his opinion that Saxpy was a member of the
public.  Macdonell J. reasoned that this was sufficient to bring the charge
within paragraph 27 of the Schedule.  I agree with the Court of Appeal that the
issue is not whether Saxpy was a member of the public but whether an accused
could be convicted in the United States of using the telephone in connection
with a scheme to defraud the public when the scheme was aimed at one person,
Saxpy.  As the Court of Appeal held, Mr. Altschuler expressed no opinion
on that issue although the question was put to him in various ways.  There was
thus no evidence on an essential precondition to the issuance of a warrant
under s. 18.  The extradition judge was therefore without jurisdiction to
issue the warrant.

 

IV.  Disposition

 

                   I would accordingly
dismiss both appeals.

 

                                                                    I

 

United States of America v. Charles
McVey II, also known as Charles Julius McVey (21331)

 

                   The judgment of La
Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and Cory JJ. was delivered by 

 

//La Forest J.//

 

                   La
Forest J. -- The issue in
this appeal is whether, at an extradition hearing for the surrender of a
fugitive who has been accused of having committed a crime in the state
requesting his surrender, it is necessary to prove that the act charged
constitutes a crime listed in the extradition treaty under the law of the
requesting state.

 

Facts

 

                   The respondent was
indicted by a grand jury in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California on March 3, 1983.  The indictment charged the respondent
with 23 offences, but only 11 are relevant for our purposes, namely:

 

                   a.  one
count of conspiracy to:

 

                   (1)
. . . knowingly export high-technology electronic components . . .
from the United States to the U.S.S.R. without having first obtained the
required validated export license from the United States Department of
Commerce, . . . and 

 

                   (2)
. . . knowingly and willfully submit false statements to the U.S.
Department of Commerce and the U.S. Customs Service . . .

 

                   b.  one
count that he:

 

                          . . .
knowingly and willfully made and caused to be made a false, fictitious and
fraudulent statement and representation as to material facts within the
jurisdiction of the United States Customs Service and the United States
Department of Commerce . . . in that [he] filed and caused to be
filed with the United States Customs Service and the United States Department
of Commerce a Shipper's Export Declaration which stated that the commodities
exported were generators, parts and accessories and had an ultimate destination
of Zurich, Switzerland whereas in truth and fact, as [he] well knew, the
commodities exported were, among others, three Memorex 677 disc drive and a
Digital Equipment Corporation SP 11-FC PDP 11/70 Spares Kit and the ultimate
destination of the commodities was the U.S.S.R.

 

and
nine other counts that were identical except for the offence dates and the
commodities exported.  

 

In short, the respondent was charged
with one count of conspiracy to export high-technology equipment to the
U.S.S.R. and ten counts of having made false statements to the United States
Department of Commerce and the United States Customs Service to effect such
export.

 

                   The United States
began extradition proceedings in Canada to secure the respondent's surrender,
and the latter was arrested pursuant to a warrant of apprehension issued in
respect of the above charges on February 4, 1988 by Spencer J. of the Supreme
Court of British Columbia, pursuant to s. 10 of the Extradition Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21 (now R.S.C., 1985, c. E-23).  An
extradition hearing then took place before Dohm J. of the same court.  In his
view, the requirements for committal under the Act were fulfilled.  There was
evidence identifying the respondent as the person named in the United States
indictment; there was evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could
convict; the conduct of the respondent would, in Canada, constitute the crime
of forgery as defined in ss. 324 and 282 of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , ss. 366  and
321 ) and the crime of forgery is an extradition crime in Canada because it is
listed in the treaty between Canada and the United States.  It was, in Dohm
J.'s view, sufficient that the act charged constituted forgery as interpreted
by the law of Canada.  He rejected the argument that it was also necessary for
the United States to prove that the crime was listed in the treaty under the
law of the United States.  He therefore issued a warrant of committal on April
8, 1988.

 

                   The respondent,
however, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and on June 17,
1988, Bouck J. granted the application ((1988), 30 B.C.L.R. (2d) 197)  In his
view, committal could not be ordered because the offences charged were not
""extradition crimes"" within the meaning of the Act because it had not
been proved that they were listed in the treaty according to the law of the United
States.

 

                   The British
Columbia Court of Appeal agreed with Bouck J. ((1988), 33 B.C.L.R. (2d) 28). 
It felt bound by this Court's decision in Washington (State of) v. Johnson,
[1988] 1 S.C.R. 327, to hold that the crimes for which extradition was sought
must constitute offences listed in the schedule both according to the law of
Canada and of the United States.

 

                   Leave to appeal to
this Court was granted on June 8, 1989 ([1989] 1 S.C.R. xvi), and the appeal
was heard on October 30, 1991.  The respondent has now voluntarily left the
country but because of the importance of the issue and because he may arguably
return to Canada, the appellant still seeks the Court's decision on the issue. 
The respondent raised a number of secondary issues, but these were summarily
dismissed from the Bench.

 

General Considerations

 

                   During the course
of the argument and in the courts below, reference was made to abstract principles
and ""rules"" of extradition such as double criminality, specialty and
reciprocity as if they had independent force.  The arguments and the reasons in
the courts below at times also evidenced some misunderstanding about the
respective function of extradition treaties and statutes, and consequently of
the separate roles of the executive and the courts both of this country and the
requesting state.  This interplay of treaty and statute was at times
contrasted, in my view incorrectly, with that prevailing in Great Britain.  It
seems useful then to get down to basics.

 

                   To begin with, it
is important to remember that under customary international law states have no
obligation to surrender fugitives from justice to other states; see United
States v. Allard, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 861, at p. 865.  To create such
obligation, it is necessary to enter into treaties.  So far as the
international obligations of Canada (and for that matter other states) are
concerned, therefore, they must be found within the confines of the treaties. 
Of course, some assistance may be found in the practices followed by other
states and there is considerable similarity in the practices of different
states.  In discussing these practices, international writers have for
convenience identified certain principles or ""rules"" such as double
criminality and so on.  These are convenient labels, and this international
practice, as noted in Allard (at p. 865), ""may no doubt have a
certain value in interpreting the law"", but in the end the international
duty must be found in the terms of the appropriate treaty.  This was the
position taken by this Court in R. v. Parisien, [1988] 1
S.C.R. 950.

 

                   Equally these
principles and rules do not exist at common law.  At common law, the executive
had no power to extradite criminals.  Nor would a treaty obligation undertaken
by Canada alone authorize the executive to do so.  A treaty does not alter the
law of the land.  A statute is required to implement it.  From the standpoint
of domestic law, therefore, extradition is a creature of statute.  The domestic
law of this country is to be found in the Extradition Act ; see also Allard,
supra, at p. 865.

 

                   Canada's
international obligations, then, are to be found in the treaty.  The purpose of
the Act is to ensure that the law of the land conforms to the treaty.  It is to
the former instrument that the courts must turn to find their authority in
extradition matters.  The genesis of the present Act may be traced to the first
British statute of general application on the subject, The Extradition Act ,
1870 (U.K.), 33 & 34 Vict., c. 52.  The Act was made applicable to
Canada pursuant to s. 17 , but because s. 27  retained previous
Canadian legislation, it led to great confusion in Canada, and Canada took
steps to provide for its own extradition procedure, The Extradition Act ,
1877, S.C. 1877, c. 25; see La Forest's Extradition To
and From Canada (3rd ed. 1991), by Anne W. La Forest, at pp. 5-6
(hereafter ""La Forest's Extradition, 3rd ed."").

 

                   The Canadian Act of
1877 was very closely modelled on the British Act of 1870.  The changes for the
most part were to the order in which the provisions appear and some
inconsequential verbal changes; the comparable provisions are noted in La Forest's
Extradition, 3rd ed., at pp. 273 et seq.  This is scarcely
surprising.  The Act was intended to implement treaties entered into by Great
Britain, many of which, I may say, continue to apply to Canada.  The fact that
Canada could not then enter into treaties accounts for the major difference of
any substance between the British and the Canadian statute.  The British
statute provided that the crimes for which surrender might be made were those
listed in a schedule to the Act.  Whenever a treaty was entered into providing
for the surrender of a crime not so listed, the schedule was amended.  The
Canadian Act retained the schedule, but since Canada did not negotiate the
treaties and was far more open towards extradition than the British, it simply
provided for the addition of new crimes in treaties by defining (s. 1, now
s. 2) extradition crimes as including not only those in the schedule but
others set forth in a treaty.  This is purely a matter of procedure, however,
and does not effect any substantial change.  As was noted in Allard, supra,
at p. 867:  ""It would be odd if a different rule were applied to
crimes listed in Schedule I than to those mentioned in the treaty only."" 
There, it will be remembered, the Court applied a provision of the Act to
crimes that appeared in the treaty only, even though the provision was by its
terms restricted to crimes mentioned in Schedule I.

 

                   A second, but
related, difference flowing from Canada's incapacity to negotiate treaties at
the inception of our present scheme of extradition is found in s. 4 of The
Extradition Act, 1877 (now s. 3).  In Great Britain, a treaty only
came into effect when it was applied by Order in Council.  In Canada, it was
provided that the treaties would apply during their continuance.  But given the
fact that Great Britain, not Canada, negotiated the treaties, provisions could
be inserted in treaties that might not precisely square with the procedure set
forth in the Canadian Act.  ""For the avoidance of doubts"", therefore,
s. 4(2) added that any provision of the Act that might be deemed to be
inconsistent with a term of the treaty would not have effect to contravene the
treaty; the Act was to be construed to provide for the execution of the treaty.

 

                   This provision
should not be read as incorporating into the Act every provision of the
treaty.  Many of the latter provisions are aimed at setting forth the broad
obligations of the High Contracting Parties and the duties of the executive and
its officials, and have nothing to do with extradition hearings.  These
include, for example, detailed provisions regarding the form of requisitions
for surrender and many of the papers that should accompany them to assist the
executive in its decision.  It was never intended that extradition judges
should be concerned with all these matters and the Act does not provide for
it.  The judicial procedures are described in the treaties in only the most
general terms.  These procedures are specifically set forth in the Act, and it
is to the Act that the extradition judge must principally turn for guidance. 
Section 4 of The Extradition Act, 1877 (now s. 3) simply was
intended to ensure that the Canadian provisions conformed to treaty provisions
that were negotiated against the background of the law of Great Britain.  It
does not provide for the broad incorporation of treaty provisions into judicial
extradition proceedings; it was simply intended to avoid possible
inconsistencies.  Any other approach would defeat the basic purpose of the
Act.  Such inconsistencies were, in any event, hardly likely.  Our Act was
largely modelled on the British Act.  Section 4(2) was obviously added out of
an abundance of caution; it originally began, we saw, with the words
""[f]or the avoidance of doubts . . . .""

 

                   A further related
point must be made.  The Act was intended to provide a general scheme of
extradition.  Until the British Act of 1870, the few British extradition
treaties then existing had been implemented by special statutes.  The 1870
statute was intended to provide a general system applicable to all extradition
treaties.  Given its terms and background, our statute must also be looked upon
as establishing a general scheme.  While the Act must be read consistently with
the treaties affecting the same matters, it would, given the statute's intention
to create a general system, be wrong to attempt assiduously  to find
inconsistencies, or to read into the duties of the extradition judge matters
intended for executive decision and not assigned to the extradition judge by
the Act.  In fact the statute may be used to some extent to interpret the
treaties; see Re DeBaun (1888), 32 L.C. Jur. 281, and R. v.
Governor of Brixton Prison, ex p. Minervini, [1958] 3 All E.R. 318
(Q.B.).

 

                   At all events, most
of the treaties bear a considerable similarity to one another.  Thus from the
earliest days to the present, many of the treaties contain provisions such as
those in the treaty in this case that speak of ""reciprocal
extradition"" or require that crimes be punishable by at least one year's
imprisonment in both states.  So there is no substance to the argument that the
existence of these provisions in the treaty under consideration here makes it
different from other treaties.  A number of others deal with the situation by
restricting surrender to indictable offences or types of offences of equivalent
seriousness in the foreign state.  The early treaties are reproduced in the
Appendix to F. Piggott's Extradition:  A Treatise on the Law Relating to
Fugitive Offenders (1910); references to existing treaties applicable to
Canada appear in La Forest's Extradition, 3rd ed., App. II, at
pp. 359 et seq.  There are, to be sure, some variations in language
and substance but, given the nature of the implementing statute, it should not
be readily assumed that these changes are in fundamental disaccord with the
structure of the Act.  This assertion is buttressed  by the remarkable
similarity between cases considering different treaties, both in Canada and
Great Britain.

 

                   Finally, I might in
passing refer to one further procedural difference between British and Canadian
practices.  In Great Britain, when a requisition for the surrender of a
fugitive by a foreign state is made, it is generally the political authorities
that first identify the British crime that conforms to that set forth in the
foreign warrant, and it is the appropriate crime under British law that is set
forth in the warrant of arrest presented to the magistrate at the extradition
hearing.  In Canada a practice had developed long before Confederation of going
directly to a judge, without the previous interposition of the political
authorities; see La Forest's Extradition, 3rd ed., at
pp. 3-4.  At that time, virtually all extradition cases were with the
United States, which shared with Canada not only the same language but the same
system of criminal law.  It thus posed no great problem for the extradition
judge to identify the crime for which the fugitive was sought according to
the law of Canada.  Given the geographical extent of Canada, the British
approach was really inappropriate; see M. C. Blanchflower, ""Interpretation
and Application of Extradition Crime in the Extradition Act "" (1992), 34 Crim. L.Q.
158, at p. 171.  This pre-Confederation practice, which had the advantage
of expediting the extradition process, has generally been followed to this
day.  In practice, it would appear, the crime as it is known in the foreign
state is set forth in the information and warrant of arrest, and this leaves it
up to the extradition judge to identify the equivalent Canadian crime at the
hearing; see ibid., at p. 162.  As Borins Co. Ct. J. (as he then
was) put it in Re United States of America and Smith (1984), 15
C.C.C. (3d) 16 (Ont. Co. Ct.), at p. 27 (aff'd 16 C.C.C.
(3d) 10 (Ont. H.C.)):  ""It is the task of the extradition court to fit a
set of facts constituting the conduct of the alleged fugitive, not into the
legal framework set up by the applicant government, but into Canadian
legislation to determine if the alleged conduct constitutes an offence pursuant
to that legislation.""  This does not ordinarily pose any problem because
most Canadian extradition cases are with the United States and as a general
rule the same criminal act or conduct falls within an offence of the same name
in both countries.  There is, however, much to be said for Blanchflower's view
(supra, pp. 171-74) that the information in support of the warrant
of arrest should set forth the name of the Canadian offence in the first place;
it would be a better practice and avoid confusion.  But s. 10(1) is not
explicit on the point and either practice is valid.  Consistent with the
general principle that extradition laws should be liberally construed so as to
achieve the purposes of the treaty, a much less technical approach to
extradition warrants than to common law warrants has been adopted; see La Forest's
Extradition, 3rd ed., at pp. 128-29.

 

The Relevant Provisions of the Act and
the Treaty

 

The Act

 

                   I come now to a
discussion of the provisions of the Act regarding the jurisdiction of a judge
at an extradition hearing.  So far as regards an accused fugitive, the
situation here, that jurisdiction is set forth in s. 18(1)(b) of
the Act.  Since I shall later have occasion to deal with s. 18(1)(a)
as well, I reproduce the whole of s. 18(1) here:

 

                   18. (1)  The judge shall
issue his warrant for the committal of the fugitive to the nearest convenient
prison, there to remain until surrendered to the foreign state, or discharged
according to law,

 

(a)  in
the case of a fugitive alleged to have been convicted of an extradition crime,
if such evidence is produced as would, according to the law of Canada,
subject to this Part, prove that he was so convicted, and

 

(b)  in
the case of a fugitive accused of an extradition crime, if such evidence is
produced as would, according to the law of Canada, subject to this Part,
justify his committal for trial, if the crime had been committed in Canada. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

Put simply, s. 18(1)(b)
tells us that the extradition judge's duty is to commit for surrender a
fugitive accused of an extradition crime, if such evidence is produced as would
according to the law of Canada justify his or her committal.

 

                   What then is an
""extradition crime""?  The term is defined in s. 2 of the Act as
any crime that if committed in Canada would be one of the crimes
described in Schedule I to the Act, or a crime described in an extradition
arrangement (i.e., treaty) whether or not it is listed in that
Schedule.  That provision reads:

 

                   2.  In this Act

 

                                                                   . . .

 

""extradition
crime"" may mean any crime that, if committed in Canada, or within
Canadian jurisdiction, would be one of the crimes described in Schedule I; and,
in the application of this Act to the case of any extradition arrangement,
""extradition crime"" means any crime described in such arrangement,
whether or not it is comprised in that Schedule;  [Emphasis added.]

 

Moreover, by s. 34 (which
reproduces the opening words of the First Schedule to the British Act of 1870),
it is provided that the list of crimes in the Schedule are to be construed according
to the law of Canada.  It reads:

 

                   34.  The list of crimes in
Schedule I shall be construed according to the law existing in Canada at the
date of the alleged crime, whether by common law or by statute made before or
after the 28th day of April 1877, and as including only such crimes, of the
descriptions comprised in the list, as are, under that law, indictable
offences.

 

If one confines oneself to the crimes
listed in the Schedule, which comprise the vast majority of all extradition
crimes, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that what the extradition judge
must determine is whether a prima facie case exists that the act charged
constitutes a crime according to Canadian law.  I note that the crimes for which
the respondent's surrender is sought (apart from conspiracy ‑‑
which only appears in the treaty, Art. 2(2)) are listed in Schedule I,
item 4 of which reads:  ""Forgery, counterfeiting or altering, or
uttering what is forged, counterfeited or altered.""  That being so,
the ten acts of misrepresentation with which the fugitive is charged constitute
extradition crimes pursuant to the definition of that term in s. 2 of the
Act.

 

                   I would not wish it
to be thought, however, that a different regime is mandated for crimes (like
the conspiracy charged) that appear in the treaty but not in Schedule I.  I
have already explained that the reason for the addition of what is now para. (b)
of the definition of extradition crime (R.S.C., 1985, c. E-23, s. 2) was to
ensure that the Act would automatically apply to additional crimes set forth in
new treaties, just as those new treaties were automatically implemented by the
Act.  It would be anomalous indeed if different regimes were established for
crimes listed in the Schedule and those listed in the treaty alone.  Indeed,
this Court has recently decided that this is not the case.  In
interpreting s. 34 (which provides that the crimes in Schedule I are to be
construed in accordance with the law of Canada), the Court in Allard,
supra, stated, at p. 867:

 

It
is true that s. 34 applies in terms only to crimes listed in Schedule I of
the Act, but it must not be forgotten that when s. 34 came into force,
these crimes were the only extradition crimes.  The Canadian Act was closely
modelled on the British statute except that, unlike the latter, it provided for
the addition of crimes without adding to the Schedule.  While the section was
drafted in a rather clumsy manner, the general principle is clearly apparent. 
It would be odd if a different rule were applied to crimes listed in Schedule I
than to those mentioned in the treaty only.

 

                   Shortly put, then,
under the Act an ""extradition crime"" is one that if committed in
Canada would be one described in the schedule or treaty as construed according
to the law of Canada.  There is nothing in the Act requiring proof that the act
charged be a crime under the foreign law.

 

                   My colleague,
Justice Sopinka, argues that the Act does contain one provision, s. 15,
that restricts the application of the term ""extradition crime"" as
defined in the Act.  I think it more accurate to say that the provision recognizes
the possibility that a treaty may restrict it.  Section 15 (s. 9 of the
British Act) reads:

 

                   15.  The judge shall receive,
in like manner, any evidence tendered to show that the crime of which
the fugitive is accused or alleged to have been convicted is an offence of a
political character, or is, for any other reason, not an extradition crime, or
that the proceedings are being taken with a view to prosecute or punish him for
an offence of a political character.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   In enacting s. 15,
Parliament principally focussed on political offences, surrender for which is
proscribed under all the treaties.  However, Parliament by that provision also
appears to have recognized that other qualifications to the term
""extradition crime"" might be made by the treaties.  It should be
observed, however, that s. 15 only empowers the extradition judge to take
evidence.  It gives the judge no additional power.  Political offences apart,
the only additional express power given the judge is, pursuant to s. 19(b),
to transmit the evidence to the Minister of Justice for consideration.  In the
case of political offences, but in that case only, the Act is somewhat more
explicit.  Section 21 provides that no fugitive is liable to surrender for
political offences, and ss. 22(a) and (b) empower the
Minister to refuse to surrender for such offences.  But even in the case of
political offences, it remains an open question whether the extradition judge
has jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offence is of a political
nature.  A few Canadian cases assumed that such jurisdiction exists, but in
1973 the Federal Court of Appeal held that this issue falls solely within the
purview of the executive, the extradition judge's function being limited to
accepting any relevant evidence and transmitting it to the Minister of Justice;
see Re State of Wisconsin and Armstrong (1973), 10 C.C.C. (2d) 271;
for a discussion, see La Forest's Extradition, 3rd ed., at
pp. 84-85, 185-86.  I should say that in England s. 3(1), the equivalent
of ss. 21 and 22(a) and (b), explicitly provides that the
extradition magistrate may consider the issue of political offences, but the
English courts have made it abundantly clear that this power is restricted to
political offences and does not apply to the other matters about which the
magistrate may receive evidence under the equivalent of our s. 15 (s. 9);
the latest case is R. v. Governor of Pentonville Prison, ex p. Sinclair,
[1991] 2 A.C. 64 (H.L.) (hereafter referred to as Sinclair).

 

                   I need not, for the
purposes of this case, resolve the issue so far as it relates to political
offences.  This depends on an interpretation of specific provisions of the Act
that are not before us.  I simply note that even in this, the clearest of cases
to which s. 15 applies, it is by no means certain that the extradition judge
has any jurisdiction other than to receive the evidence and transmit it to the
Minister.  Whatever may be the case regarding political offences, I entertain
very strong doubt that the extradition judge was intended to monitor all the
many and variegated conditions, qualifications and restrictions to which states
have qualified their obligations to other states to surrender fugitive
criminals.  Lord Bridge of Harwich, speaking for all the Law Lords in Government
of Belgium v. Postlethwaite, [1987] 3 W.L.R. 365 (H.L.), at p. 390,
expressed a similar doubt.  Such monitoring could lead to endless delays in a
procedure intended to be expeditious.  As Lord Templeman put it in Postlethwaite,
at p. 392:  ""The progress of committal proceedings is a matter for
the magistrate who, in practice, deals with extradition proceedings with the
utmost despatch consistently with the needs of the prosecution and the
requirements of the defence.""  More recently in Sinclair, Lord
Ackner, also speaking for all the Law Lords, made it clear (at p. 89) that
""monitoring the provisions of the Treaty is an executive, and not a
magisterial, function"".  In Canada, though there has been scant discussion
of the theoretical foundations of the issue, there has in practice been little
recourse to the niceties of the treaty provisions.   Counsel and judges have
properly confined themselves within the four corners of the Act.  Recently,
however, counsel have extended their submissions to matters comprised in treaty
provisions.  The present case itself indicates the possibilities for endless
delays as counsel and judges attempt to navigate an unfamiliar sea.  In
England, there has been a tendency (though fairly recent) to advance these
treaty arguments at extradition hearings, leading to horrendously difficult
cases that only the most determined can read or understand.  A number of these
are described in Sinclair.  The recent cases have established that this
incorporation of treaty provisions into the Act has never been the intent of
the Act or the treaties.  No provision in the Act is to this effect and the
English courts have recently put an end to the practice that had developed. 
Lord Ackner concludes the relevant part of his reasons on the following note
(at pp. 91-92):  ""Certainly for the future, if your Lordships concur
that the magistrate has no jurisdiction to decide . . . whether the
requirements of the Treaty have been satisfied, his powers being limited to
those specified in sections 3(1), 8, 9 and 10, much time should be saved both
in the magistrates' and in the Divisional Court.""

 

                   Some perspective
may be gained through reflection on what an extradition treaty is.  It is an
agreement between two sovereign states whereby each agrees to surrender on
request persons alleged to have committed crimes in the state requesting the
surrender.  To this general obligation, states frequently attach terms and
conditions.  When a request is made, the political authorities in the requested
state will examine the material to see that the request complies with these
terms and conditions.  The treaties also make provision for the requesting
state to supply certain material whereby the requested state can determine the
validity of the request and its compliance with the terms and conditions of the
treaty (see Art. 9 of the treaty here (Can. T.S. 1976 No. 3)), and it
is reasonable that these are the materials to be looked at in determining the
issue.  In essence, the treaty obligations are of a political character to be
dealt with in the absence of statute by the political authorities.  However, as
Laskin J. noted in Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v. Hernandez, [1975] 1
S.C.R. 228, at p. 245, the liberty of the individual has not been
forgotten in these rather special proceedings.  The treaties, sensitive to the
liberty of the individual, contain provisions for their protection.  Most
important is the requirement that there be prima facie evidence that the
act charged would constitute a crime in Canada.  This specific matter, about
which judges are most competent, is the task assigned to a judge by the Extradition
Act .  Other tasks, no doubt, may be assigned to extradition judges, but one
must find a statutory source, and courts should not reach out to bring within
their jurisdictional ambit matters that the Act has not assigned to them. 
Barring statutory provision, the task of dealing with international treaty
obligations is for the political authorities, and is performed by the Ministers
and departments in the course of fulfilling their appropriate mandates.  The Extradition
Act , of course, gives the Minister of Justice authority respecting the
surrender of a fugitive; see ss. 20  - 22  and 25 .  The treaty terms are
aimed at the obligations of the parties and not the internal procedures by
which these are to be carried into effect.  The spirit in which the treaties
should be approached is well stated by Lord Bridge in Postlethwaite, supra,
as follows, at pp. 383-84:

 

. . .
an extradition treaty is ""a contract between two sovereign states and has
to be construed as such a contract.  It would be a mistake to think that it had
to be construed as though it were a domestic statute:""  Reg. v.
Governor of Ashford Remand Centre, Ex parte Beese [1973] 1 W.L.R. 969, 973,
per Lord Widgery C.J.  In applying this . . . principle,
. . . it must be remembered that the reciprocal rights and
obligations which the high contracting parties confer and accept are intended
to serve the purpose of bringing to justice those who are guilty of grave
crimes committed in either of the contracting states.  To apply to extradition
treaties the strict canons appropriate to the construction of domestic
legislation would often tend to defeat rather than to serve this purpose.

 

I have found no statutory indication
that the treaty provisions advanced by counsel are of concern to the courts,
and a careful reading of these provisions makes it clear that they were
intended to be dealt with by the executive.

 

                   Finally, my
colleague appears to believe that the blank for setting forth the name of the
relevant crime in the form of warrant of committal provided in the Act must be
filled by the name of the crime under United States law.  I cannot agree.  For
my part, I would have thought perhaps the best way to describe the crime is
under the appropriate name appearing in the Schedule to the Act or the treaty. 
In England, the practice is to describe the crime that is specified by the
Secretary of State, i.e., the extradition crime as described under English law;
see Sinclair, supra, at p. 84.  However, I think it is
sufficient if the nature of the crime is known.  As with the warrant of
apprehension, the courts have not required particularity.  They have, for
example, found warrants that described the relevant crime as ""fraud by an
agent"" or ""stealing"" to be sufficient:   Ex p. Piot
(1883), 48 L.T. 120; Re Gross (1898), 2 C.C.C. 67 (Ont. C.A.); Ex
parte Thomas (1917), 28 C.C.C. 396.  If discussion of issues of that kind
can now only be found in early cases, it is presumably because the principle
that the technicalities of criminal law only apply to a limited extent in
extradition cases is now well understood by the courts.

 

                   I turn now to the
treaty provisions.

 

The Relevant Treaty Provisions

 

                   Like most treaties,
the one under consideration here (Extradition Treaty between Canada and the
United States of America, Can. T.S. 1976 No. 3) only speaks in general
terms about the procedures to be employed by the requested state in
implementing its treaty obligations.  It leaves the details to the law of the
requested state.  Article 8, so far as relevant, reads as follows:

 

                                                            Article
8

 

                   The
determination that extradition should or should not be granted shall be made in
accordance with the law of the requested State . . ..

 

Article 9(3) referring to the grounds
of arrest and Art. 10(1) dealing with the sufficiency of evidence again
refer to the law of the requested country.  Indeed one could, in reading the
treaty along with the Act, not unfairly hold that Art. 10(1) replicates in
abridged form s. 18(1) of the Act.  In relevant part, the former reads:

 

                                                           Article
10

 

(1)  Extradition
shall be granted only if the evidence be found sufficient, according to the
laws of the place where the person sought shall be found, either to justify his
committal for trial if the offense of which he is accused had been committed in
its territory or to prove that he is the identical person convicted by the courts
of the requesting State.

 

                   At the very least,
there is no inconsistency here with the provisions of the Act.  There is
nothing in the text of the treaty itself that specifically requires proof of
foreign law at an extradition hearing.  It was argued, however, that there are
two provisions that impose such a requirement.  The first (Art. 2(1))
provides that the relevant offences be punishable by at least one year's
imprisonment under the laws of both countries.  The other (Art. 2(3))
deals with United States federal offences.

 

                   Article 2(1) reads:

 

                                                            Article
2

 

(1)  Persons
shall be delivered up according to the provisions of this Treaty for any of the
offenses listed in the Schedule annexed to this Treaty, which is an integral
part of this Treaty, provided these offenses are punishable by the laws of both
Contracting Parties by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.

 

One would expect that the High
Contracting Parties would make provision to enable the requested state to
monitor this obligation.   And so they do.  So far as the requirement that the
act charged must be a crime in the requested state, Art. 10 provides that
extradition shall be granted only if evidence be found sufficient, according to
the law of the requested state, to justify the committal of the fugitive for
trial if the offence had been committed in the requested state, or to prove
that he or she is the identical person convicted by the courts in the
requesting state.  This critical function for the liberty of the subject is
assigned by the Extradition Act  to an extradition judge under a
procedure similar to a preliminary hearing.  This is a matter the judge is more
competent to do.  To expedite the procedure and minimize expense, however,
depositions are to be admitted in evidence in lieu of witnesses at the hearing
when properly certified and authenticated (Art. 10(2) ).  For their
validity, we thus rely on the fairness and good faith of judicial and political
authorities of the requesting state.

 

                   To monitor the
obligation as it applies to the foreign law, a different procedure is adopted. 
The evidence that the offence is a crime in the foreign country is determined
by the executive of the requested state in considering the validity of the
requisition.  Article 9 of the treaty enables it to do so.   That provision
requires that the request for surrender be accompanied by, among other things,
a statement of the facts of the case and ""the text of the laws of the
requesting State describing the offense and prescribing the punishment for the
offense"" (Art. 9(2)) (emphasis added).   As well, in the case of an
accused fugitive (the situation here), the requesting state must provide ""a
warrant of arrest issued by a judge or other judicial officer of the requesting
State"" (Art. 9(3)) (emphasis added), and in case of a convicted
fugitive, ""the judgment of conviction and sentence"" (emphasis
added).  Article 9 reads:

 

                                                            Article
9

 

(1)  The
request for extradition shall be made through the diplomatic channel.

 

(2)  The
request shall be accompanied by a description of the person sought, a statement
of the facts of the case, the text of the laws of the requesting State
describing the offense and prescribing the punishment for the offense, and a
statement of the law relating to the limitation of the legal proceedings.

 

(3)  When
the request relates to a person who has not yet been convicted, it must also be
accompanied by a warrant of arrest issued by a judge or other judicial officer
of the requesting State and by such evidence as, according to the laws of the
requested State, would justify his arrest and committal for trial if the
offense had been committed there, including evidence proving the person
requested is the person to whom the warrant of arrest refers.

 

(4)  When
the request relates to a person already convicted, it must be accompanied by
the judgment of conviction and sentence passed against him in the territory of
the requesting State, by a statement showing how much of the sentence has not
been served, and by evidence proving that the person requested is the person to
whom the sentence refers.

 

Nowhere is the duty to consider the
foreign law assigned to the extradition judge.  This, as I mentioned, is a task
for the political authorities at common law, now assigned by statute to the
Minister of Justice.   It is not unreasonable for the Minister to rely on the
material supplied with the requisition as proof of foreign law, as demonstrated
by the fact that it has been accepted for that purpose in both the House of
Lords and this Court; see Postlethwaite, supra, at
pp. 390-91, and Washington (State of) v. Johnson, supra.

 

                   The approach I have
adopted here is substantially the same as that taken by the House of Lords in Postlethwaite
and Sinclair, supra.  In England, it will be remembered, the
consideration of the requisition comes first, after which the case is presented
to the extradition commissioner on order of the Secretary of State.  In Canada,
the procedure, we saw, is more fluid, the case frequently coming before the
extradition judge before the formal requisition has been made.  But the substance
is the same; the Minister of Justice may at any time refuse to surrender and
discharge the fugitive (s. 22 of the Act).

 

                   I shall take less
time with the second provision that purportedly requires proof of foreign law,
because I rather doubt if it applies in the present case.  That provision is
Art. 2(3) which reads:

 

                                                            Article
2

 

                                                                   . . .

 

(3)  Extradition
shall also be granted for any offense against a federal law of the United
States in which one of the offenses listed in the annexed Schedule, or made extraditable
by paragraph (2) of this Article, is a substantial element, even if
transporting, transportation, the use of the mails or interstate facilities are
also elements of the specific offense.

 

This provision was not adopted to
complicate the law, but to simplify it.  In the United States, the individual
States, of course, have jurisdiction over criminal law, and federal offences
must be framed so as to come within federal legislative power.   Article 2(3)
permits surrender for an offence listed in the treaty, though it contains
components to conform to United States constitutional requirements that do not,
of course, appear in comparable Canadian offences.

 

                   The listed offences
also make no reference to the law of the requesting state except in the case of
sexual offences against children (item 6), which is no doubt meant to ensure
that these particular offences are not to be prosecuted under more general
provisions.  This requirement, like that in Art. 2(1), could, I would
think, be adequately established, so far as foreign law is concerned, by the
text of the law accompanying the request for surrender.

 

                   All of these
exceptions seem to me to be of the kind that prove the rule.  Apart from these,
I see nothing that would vitiate the direction in Art. 8 of the treaty that the
determination that extradition should or should not be granted shall be made in
accordance with Canadian law.  Put another way, there is nothing inconsistent
(which is what s. 3 requires) with the Extradition Act , which we
saw only requires that there be prima facie evidence of an act that
constitutes a crime listed in the treaty according to the law of Canada.  In
fact, the Act does not deal with proof of foreign law at all.  That, as I said,
is a matter for the executive.

 

                   I am wholly
unimpressed by the argument that the scheme so administered does not provide
for reciprocal surrender of offenders, as contemplated in the preamble to the
treaty and in most other extradition treaties.  There is, of course, a
reciprocal arrangement for the exchange of criminals falling within certain
categories, and that arrangement functions with relative smoothness on an
ongoing basis.  To require proof of foreign law in an extradition hearing (to
ensure compliance with foreign law) would, as I shall attempt to demonstrate,
serve no useful purpose and seriously impede the purpose set forth in the
preamble of the treaty of making more effective the cooperation of the two
countries in the repression of crime.  Quite apart from this, however, it would
seem odd if general words in a preamble were to be given more weight than the
specific provisions that deal with the matter.  I observe that the reasoning I
have adopted in relation to Art. 2(1) applies equally to this clause so
that in the end this is a matter of concern to the executive, not the
extradition judge.  I would add that the treaties in the cases supporting my
view of Art. 2(1) also contained a reciprocal clause like the one with
which we are concerned here; see In re Nielsen, [1984] A.C. 606 (H.L.), United
States Government v. McCaffery, [1984] 2 All E.R. 570 (H.L.), Postlethwaite,
Johnson and Sinclair, supra.

 

Purpose of the Hearing

 

                   The function of the
extradition hearing, then, as observed in Argentina v. Mellino, [1987] 1
S.C.R. 536, is a modest one.  That function is to determine whether there
is sufficient evidence that a fugitive accused has committed an act in the
requesting state that would, if committed in Canada, constitute a Canadian
crime listed or described in the treaty.  In short, and I shall have more to
say about this later, what the extradition judge must determine is whether the conduct
of the accused would constitute a crime if it had been committed in this
country.  This function, if modest in scope, is critical to the liberty of the
individual.  This Court thus put the matter in Canada v. Schmidt, [1987]
1 S.C.R. 500, at p. 515:

 

                   The
hearing thus protects the individual in this country from being surrendered for
trial for a crime in a foreign country unless prima facie evidence is
produced that he or she has done something there that would constitute a crime
mentioned in the treaty if committed here.

 

Lord Ackner's statement in Sinclair,
at p. 82, that the extradition judge ""has important but very limited
functions to perform"", aptly describes the situation.

 

                   The protection
afforded the fugitive does not end there.  I have mentioned that the treaty
provides that the requisition be accompanied by the text of the law of the
requesting state describing the offence and prescribing the punishment as well
as a warrant of arrest issued by a judge or other judicial officer in that
state.  Unless we put in question the good faith or competence of the judicial
and other authorities in that country -- something against which courts,
including this Court have repeatedly warned us (see, for example, Schmidt,
at p. 516) -- I fail to understand my colleague's fear that we might send a
person to a foreign country for a crime that does not exist.

 

                   Nor is this all the
protection afforded the fugitive.  The treaty further provides (and this is so
of all the treaties) that the person surrendered shall not be detained, tried
or punished for an offence other than that for which extradition has been
granted (Art. 12(1)).  In short, he can only be prosecuted by the
requesting state for the offence for which his surrender was made.  Anglin J.
made this abundantly clear in Buck v. The King (1917), 55 S.C.R. 133,
where, in dealing with the offences for which a person who had been extradited
to Canada could be prosecuted, he stated, at p. 145:

 

. . .
""the offence for which (the accused) was surrendered"" means the
specific offence with . . . which he was charged before the
Extradition Commissioner [in the surrendering state] and in respect of which that
official held that a primâ facie case had been established and ordered
his extradition, and not another offence or crime, though of identical legal
character and committed about the same time and under similar circumstances.

 

The same is true in the United States
where a returned fugitive has a justiciable right to be tried solely for the
crime for which he was surrendered.  The leading case (on which Anglin J.
relied in Buck) is United States v. Rauscher, 119 U.S. 407
(1886), where Miller J. stated the opinion of the majority of the Supreme Court
regarding the rights of an extradited fugitive, at p. 424:

 

                   That
right, as we understand it, is that he shall be tried only for the offence with
which he is charged in the extradition proceedings and for which he was
delivered up, and that if not tried for that, or after trial and acquittal, he
shall have a reasonable time to leave the country before he is arrested upon
the charge of any other crime committed previous to his extradition.

 

See also Johnson v. Browne, 205
U.S. 309 (1907); United States v. Sobell, 142 F.Supp. 515 (1956), aff'd
244 F.2d. 520 (1957), at p. 524, cert. denied 355 U.S. 873 (1957); United
States v. Alvarez-Machain., 119 L. Ed. 2d 441 (1992).

 

                   The trial judge in
the United States, of course, deals with the offence under the law of that
country.  The identity of that offence can be determined by reference to the
text of that law supplied with the requisition.  The extradition judge in
Canada, on the other hand, is concerned with whether the underlying facts of
the charge would, prima facie, have constituted a crime listed in the
treaty if they had occurred in Canada.  That is what is meant by saying that
double criminality is conduct based.  The courts of both countries deal with
the offence under their own law, the law in which they are versed, but each
must ascertain whether under that law the facts support the charge.

 

                   I fail to see how
proof of foreign law can advance the purpose of the extradition hearing as I
have identified it, except possibly in rare cases such as political offences
that may be expressly assigned to the extradition judge.  On the other hand, to
require evidence of foreign law beyond the documents now supplied with the requisition
could cripple the operation of the extradition proceedings.  It is unthinkable
that this would even have been contemplated at the time the Act was passed and
many of the existing treaties were negotiated.  To transport witnesses,
sometimes halfway across the world, would have seemed an impossible prospect. 
Quite different reasons argue against the possibility in modern times.  In our
days, crime does not stop at the border.  Much of organized crime is
international in scope.  And as this Court noted in United States of America
v. Cotroni, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1469, at p. 1485:  ""The only respect
paid by the international criminal community to national boundaries is when
these can serve as a means to frustrate the efforts of law enforcement and
judicial authorities.""  This criminal community would certainly welcome
the need to prove foreign law.  Flying witnesses in to engage in abstruse
debates about legal issues arising in a legal system with which the judge is
unfamiliar is a certain recipe for delay and confusion to no useful purpose,
particularly if one contemplates the joys of translation and the entirely
different structure of foreign systems of law.  In his book Extradition in
International Law (1971), I. A. Shearer thus puts the matter, at
pp. 139-40:

 

. . .
it would seem wrong in principle that extradition should be subjected to the
unnecessary additional hazard of proof of criminality according to a law
unfamiliar to the court before which the fugitive is brought.  The true
purposes of the double criminality rule are adequately served by the enquiry
which the court in the requested State is competent to carry out, viz. the
determination whether the act for which extradition is claimed, if committed in
the requested State, would constitute an offence under the law of that State.

 

Lord Ackner expressed his view in this
manner in Sinclair, supra, at p. 91:

 

                   Your
Lordships are concerned with the construction of an Act passed over a hundred
years ago.  I cannot accept that the legislature intended that it was to be
part of the function of the [extradition judge] to preside over lengthy
proceedings occupying weeks, and on occasions months, of his time hearing
heavily contested evidence of foreign law directed to whether there had been
due compliance with the many and varied obligations of the relevant Treaty. 
The inconvenience of such a procedure is well demonstrated by the current
litigation.

 

The same can be said of the present
litigation.  Subject to the possible exceptional circumstance of political offences
to which I have previously referred, I agree with Lord Ackner (quoting Robert
Goff L.J.) that the extradition judge ""is not concerned with foreign law
at all"" (at p. 84).

 

The Authorities

 

                   Though the recent
leading cases affecting the Act also deal with the treaty provisions, for
clarity I shall examine the authorities under the Act and the treaty
separately.

 

The Act

 

                   The Canadian
authorities on whether or not proof of foreign law is required at an
extradition hearing for long remained in a state of confusion.  The early cases
predominantly favoured the view that it was sufficient at the extradition
hearing to establish that the act charged was an offence under Canadian law;
the fact that the act charged was also an offence in the requesting state, it
was thought, should be presumed from the fact that the request was made; see
the cases cited in La Forest's Extradition, 3rd ed., at
p. 165, n. 153.  However, the view that the foreign law must be
proved at the extradition hearing gradually gained ascendency owing to the
influence of the English approach at the time; see idem, n. 149. 
Even then, however, judges sought to avoid this result by holding that a
foreign indictment constitutes strong presumptive evidence of the foreign law;
see idem, n. 152.  Again, some judges advanced the compromise
position that common law crimes needed no proof of foreign law, but that
statutory crimes did; see idem, n. 154.  Apropos of this, I should
say that probably because most of our cases came from the United States, with
which much of Canada shares a common law background and where crimes are
similar, there were in any event not too many cases where the issue of proof of
foreign law was raised.  The confusion remained for a long time since there was
for many years no appeal from habeas corpus and individual judges took
different positions.

 

                   Though there was
confusion, no case ever decided that it was necessary at an extradition hearing
to prove that a crime came within the treaty according to the law of the requesting
state.  There are, it is true, statements in some of the cases to the effect
that the crime must be one listed in the treaty as construed by the law of both
countries (see La Forest's Extradition, 3rd ed., p. 74, nn.
126, 127), but this does not necessarily mean, and I will return to this, that
the issue of foreign law is one to be determined by the extradition judge.  The
statements are, at all events, mere dicta and I need not review them in
detail.  They fly in the face of the foregoing analysis of the Act and the
treaty, from which I have concluded that there is no point at an extradition
hearing in examining foreign law at all.  I shall, however, have more to say
about these cases later.

 

                   In England, the
practice of obtaining proof of foreign law began with two Divisional Court
cases dealing with habeas corpus applications late in the 19th century: 
In re Bellencontre, [1891] 2 Q.B. 122, and In re Arton (No. 2),
[1896] 1 Q.B. 509.  As Lord Diplock, speaking for the House of Lords, put it in
In re Nielsen, supra, at p. 622:  ""The curious feature
of the judgments in each of these two cases is that in neither of them was
there any reference to the terms of those sections of the Acts which were the
sole source of the jurisdiction of the magistrate [in Canada the extradition
judge]. . ..""  They appear to have devised the practice out of
whole cloth.  The Royal Commission on Extradition of 1878, which had thoroughly
examined the workings of the Act, saw no such role for an extradition judge. 
It thus commented, at p. 8 of its report (British Digest of
International Laws, Appendix, at p. 810):

 

                   If
it be asked how it is to be ascertained that the offence charged is known and
recognised as an offence, the answer is that our own law will afford a
sufficient test, being abundantly comprehensive as to offences against person
and property.

 

                   Besides
which, there is another reason for seeing that the charge in respect of which
extradition is asked for is an offence under our own law.  It is and always
must be necessary that a primâ facie case shall be made out before a
magistrate in order to support the application for extradition.  But the
English magistrate cannot be expected to know or interpret the foreign law.  It
is not desirable that he should be required to do more than to see that the
facts proved constitute primâ facie an offence which would have been
within judicial cognizance if done in this country.

 

                   In fairness to the
judges who heard these cases, they acted in response to an argument by the
fugitives, which (after having examined texts of the foreign law) they
rejected.  The decisions were criticized on this point by Piggott, the leading
authority in the field at the time, and have continued to be attacked by
specialists in the field ever since; see Piggott, supra, at
pp. 124-25; Shearer, supra, at pp. 139-41; M. C. Blanchflower,
""State of Washington v. Johnson"" (1989), 31 Crim. L.Q. 197; La Forest's
Extradition (1st ed. 1961), at p. 72, (2nd ed. 1977), at
pp. 108-10, (3rd ed. 1991), at pp. 51-55, 164-74; and see also M. C.
Blanchflower, ""Examination of the Law of the Requesting State in
Extradition Proceedings"" (1992), 34 Crim. L.Q. 277.  Nonetheless
the practice, which was never justified in the cases ‑‑ see Lord
Diplock in Nielsen, at p. 623, continued and was adopted by some
judges in Canada.  The uniformity of the practice in Great Britain, as compared
to the situation in Canada, reflects the centralized court system in Great
Britain and the deference afforded to one another by judges at the same level. 
As in Canada, there were no appeals from habeas corpus, so the matter
only came up for review on appeal in recent years.

 

                   The House of Lords
had occasion to review the matter in Nielsen, supra, and held
that the practice followed in Bellencontre and Arton (No. 2) had
no foundation.  In Nielsen, the fugitive was accused in Denmark of
having fraudulently abused his position as controlling shareholder of one
company to assist financially another company under his control.  In the
warrant of arrest and subsequent orders prepared by the Home Secretary pursuant
to English practice, the offence was described in accordance with certain
English offences with which the alleged crime conformed.  The magistrate
refused to surrender because on examination of Danish law, he found the Danish
offence was not substantially similar to the English offences.  On appeal to a
Divisional Court, however, the magistrate's order was quashed.  An appeal from
that court's decision was dismissed by the House of Lords, their Lordships
confirming that the magistrate had acted improperly.  Political offences and
specific exceptions in the treaty apart, the sole jurisdiction of the magistrate
to hear the case, their Lordships held, was that set forth in s. 10 of The
Extradition Act, 1870.  As it relates to an accused fugitive, it reads:

 

                   10.  In the case of a fugitive
criminal accused of an extradition crime, if the foreign warrant authorising
the arrest of such criminal is duly authenticated, and such evidence is
produced as (subject to the provisions of this Act) would, according to the law
of England, justify the committal for trial of the prisoner if the crime of
which he is accused had been committed in England, the police magistrate shall
commit him to prison, but otherwise shall order him to be discharged.

 

I should in passing observe that this
provision is in substance (if not in precise form) the same as s. 18(1)(b)
of the Canadian Act, that the definition of extradition crime in s. 26 
conforms to that in s. 2 of our Act, and that the preamble to the list of
crimes in Schedule 1 is to the same effect as our s. 34, all of which are
cited infra.  Under these provisions, their Lordships held, the
magistrate is only required to consider whether there is a prima facie
case that the fugitive has committed an act in the requesting state that
constitutes a crime described in the treaty as defined by English law.  If so,
the magistrate must commit the accused for surrender.  As Lord Diplock,
speaking for all the Law Lords in Nielsen, put it, at pp. 624-25:

 

. . .
at the conclusion of the evidence the magistrate must decide whether such
evidence would, according to the law of England, justify the committal
for trial of the accused for an offence that is described in the 1870 list (as
added to or amended by subsequent Extradition Acts) provided that such offence
is also included in the extraditable crimes listed in the English language
version of the extradition treaty.  In making this decision it is English law
alone that is relevant.  The requirement that he shall make it does not give
him any jurisdiction to inquire into or receive evidence of the substantive
criminal law of the foreign state in which the conduct was in fact committed. 
[Emphasis in original.]

 

My colleague, Sopinka J., has referred
to a passage in this case which argues for a different disposition under
certain treaty provisions, but as I mentioned I shall deal with that issue later.

 

                   Lord Diplock
returned to the fray in McCaffery, supra.  He there set forth the
role of the magistrate in the following manner, at pp. 572-73:

 

. . .
the test whether a person in respect of whom a warrant for his arrest had been
issued in a foreign state for an offence alleged to have been committed in that
state was liable to be surrendered as a fugitive criminal was not
whether the offence specified in the foreign warrant of arrest as that for
which it had been issued was substantially similar to a crime under English law
falling within the list of offences described in the Sch I to the Extradition
Act  1870, as currently amended (ie the so-called `double criminality' test). 
The right test . . . was whether the conduct of the accused,
if it had been committed in England, would have constituted a crime falling
within one or more of the descriptions included in that list. [Emphasis in
original.] 

 

The English courts have continued this
approach to this day.  I quoted earlier Lord Ackner's excerpt from Robert Goff
L.J. in Sinclair, supra, at p. 84, that ""the magistrate
is not concerned with foreign law at all"", and there Lord Ackner reviews
other cases to the same effect.

 

                   As I mentioned
earlier, the relevant provision in the Canadian Act, s. 18(1)(b),
is precisely to the same effect as the relevant English provision, s. 10. 
Not surprisingly, then, this Court has in recent cases expressed similar views. 
Thus in Mellino, supra, the Court emphasized, at p. 553:

 

I
repeat:  the role of the extradition judge is a modest one; absent express
statutory or treaty authorization, the sole purpose of an extradition hearing
is to ensure that the evidence establishes a prima facie case that the
extradition crime has been committed.

 

As I noted earlier, ""extradition
crime"" for the purposes of the Act means an act committed in the
requesting state that would constitute a crime described in the treaty if
committed in this country.  This definition undergirds the reasoning in a
number of passages in Canada v. Schmidt, supra, including the
passage quoted above to elucidate the purpose of the procedure, namely (at
p. 515):

 

                   The
hearing thus protects the individual in this country from being surrendered for
trial for a crime in a foreign country unless prima facie evidence is
produced that he or she has done something there that would constitute a crime
mentioned in the treaty if committed here.

 

See also pp. 514-15.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
in the present case declined to follow In re Nielsen, supra. 
This, it did for two reasons.  First, it thought that para. (b) of
the definition of ""extradition crime"" in the Act gave it a wholly
different meaning from the English definition.  I have already explained what,
in my view, is the correct approach to that definition and I need say no more
about it.  A second reason why the Court of Appeal did not follow Nielsen
was that it considered itself bound to take that course by virtue of this
Court's decision in Washington (State of) v. Johnson, supra.  It
conceded, however, that the central point in Johnson was the reverse of
the one it had to decide.  In short, what the Court decided in Johnson
was that it had to be established that the crime for which a fugitive is sought
would constitute a crime listed in the treaty according to the law of Canada. 
This, in my view, is of critical importance.  In coming to its conclusion, the
Court of Appeal in the present case was obviously affected by a reference to
the definition of extradition crime in my text (2nd ed.), supra, at
p. 42, which had been cited by Wilson J.  I do not resile from that
definition as a broad description viewed from the perspective of the whole of
the extradition process, but modesty forbids (as well I fear the ordinary rules
of statutory construction) that I use it in construing the Act in lieu of the
definition set forth in the Act itself.  I shall have more to say later about
comprehensive definitions of this kind.  They are addressed to the whole of the
extradition process, and are not confined to the proceedings before the
extradition judge.  For the moment, however, it is important to observe that my
former colleague did not cite the definition in my book as a substitute for
that set forth in the Act.  She has always been too astute to do me that much
honour.  Under the heading ""Extradition Crimes"" she refers solely to
the definition of that term in the Act; similarly, as we shall see, when she
came to deal with the issue directly before her, she did so on the basis of the
statutory definition.  On the other hand, she cites the definition in my book
along with Shearer, supra, p. 137, for the proposition central to
her judgment that the ""double criminality"" rule looks to the conduct
of the individual; it does not engage a comparison of offences in the two
countries.  For a crime to be an extradition crime, she reasons, it must be an
act that is not only an offence in the requesting state but must also be one in
the requested state that is listed in the treaty.  At no time, however, does
she state that it is for the extradition judge to determine that the act
charged is a crime in the requesting state.  And when she deals with the
function of the extradition judge, which is what she was, of course, directly
concerned with, she refers to the definition in the Extradition Act . 
This she does in discussing the application of the ""double criminality
rule"" (at pp. 342-43).  Throughout she confines herself to the task
of determining whether the act charged amounts to a crime listed in the treaty
as understood by Canadian law.  This is consistent with what she deems to be
the underlying purpose of the rule of double criminality, that no person shall
be surrendered for an act (or conduct) in another country unless that act or
conduct is considered a crime here.  For this proposition, she cites (at
pp. 341-42) the following passage from Shearer, at pp. 137-38:

 

                   The
validity of the double criminality rule has never seriously been contested,
resting as it does in part on the basic principle of reciprocity which
underlies the whole structure of extradition, and in part on the maxim nulla
poena sine lege.  For the double criminality rule serves the most important
function of ensuring that a person's liberty is not restricted as a consequence
of offences not recognized as criminal by the requested State.  The social
conscience of a State is also not embarrassed by an obligation to extradite a
person who would not, according to its own standards, be guilty of acts
deserving punishment.  So far as the reciprocity principle is concerned,
the rule ensures that a State is not required to extradite categories of
offenders for which it, in return, would never have occasion to make demand. 
The point is by no means an academic one even in these days of growing
uniformity of standards; in Western Europe alone sharp variations are found
among the criminal laws relating to such matters as abortion, adultery, euthanasia,
homosexual behaviour, and suicide.  [Emphasis added by Wilson J.]

 

                   I should observe
that this passage is completely consistent with the approach of this Court set
forth in Schmidt, at p. 515, to which I have already referred.  I would
refer as well to Allard, supra, at p. 868, and to Kindler
v. Canada (Minister of Justice), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 779, where the
majority of this Court states in the words of McLachlin J., at p. 845,
that ""[w]e will not extradite for acts which are not offences in
this country"" (emphasis added).

 

                   Wilson J. dealt
with the issue before her by resort to a theoretical rubric, the ""double
criminality rule"".  But it is essential to underline her understanding of
double criminality as it applies at an extradition hearing, which I have
already described.  In short, in performing the function of applying that rule,
she quite properly did so in accordance with the definitions and requirements
of the Extradition Act .  We have already seen that what is required in
the case of an accused fugitive under s. 18(1)(b) of the Act
is prima facie proof that the fugitive has committed an act that
constitutes an ""extradition crime"" as defined in the Act or listed in
the treaty as interpreted under the law of Canada.

 

                   To fully grasp
Wilson J.'s reasoning in Johnson, it is important to note that she was
not there dealing with a fugitive who has merely been accused of an extradition
crime, but with one who has been convicted of such crime.  The Act deals
with convicted fugitives under s. 18(1)(a).  That procedure is rather
similar to that for accused fugitives under s. 18(1)(b).  Section 18(1)(a)
requires proof that the fugitive has been convicted in the requesting country
of an ""extradition crime"" as defined in the Act, which again means
that what has to be established is that the relevant act would constitute a
listed crime in accordance with the law of Canada.  However, because
what is required to be proved under s. 18(1)(a) is different, the proof
that the crime is one in Canada is not done in the same way and may involve
examining foreign law to determine whether the act for which a foreign
conviction was entered was an offence according to the law of Canada.  This can
be seen by a closer look at the relevant parts of Johnson.

 

                   Johnson was a case where the fugitive had
been convicted of ""theft in the second degree"" in the State of
Washington.  ""Theft"" was listed in the treaty.  However, the
definition of the Washington offence made no reference to the element of fraudulent
intent which is required under the law of Canada.  Since the fugitive was a
convict, Wilson J. held that s. 18(1)(a) applied.  In her view, there
were two ways in which it could be established that the conduct of the fugitive
would meet the requirements of that provision, i.e., that he had been convicted
in the requesting state of an offence that, if committed in Canada, would
constitute a crime according to the law of Canada.  One way was by showing that
the Washington offence required fraudulent intent; the other, more akin to the
approach under s. 18(1)(b), was by establishing that under the specific
facts of the case, there had been fraudulent intent.  She deals with this,
as I noted, in terms of her description of double criminality for the purposes
of s. 18(1)(a).

 

                   Turning to the
first method, she concluded that an examination of the United States law did
not reveal that the fugitive had been convicted in Washington of an offence
that would constitute the relevant extradition crime of theft as defined under
Canadian law.  Theft under Canadian law required fraudulent intent, but the
American text accompanying the requisition did not mention this fraudulent
intent, which was required by Canadian law, and this requirement had not been
otherwise established.  So it had not been shown that the conviction in
Washington constituted evidence that the fugitive's conduct would have amounted
to theft under the law of Canada, as is required by the definition of
""extradition crime"" in the Act.

 

                   Wilson J. then
turned to the second method of establishing that the offence of which the
accused was convicted would be a listed crime under Canadian law ‑‑
an examination of the facts of the case.  On an examination of those facts, she
found there was ""no evidence"" of fraudulent intention as required by
Canadian law.

 

                   Wilson J.'s mode of
approach, which I have already described, is clearly set forth, at pp. 345-46,
as follows:

 

                   I
agree with the respondent that there are two methods by which double
criminality could be established for the purposes of s. 18(1)(a). 
First, it could be established that Washington law required fraudulent intent
for a conviction of the offence charged.  This could be done either by showing
that the text of the offence includes a requirement of fraudulent intent or by
calling expert witnesses to testify that while fraudulent intent is not a
requirement apparent on the face of the Washington statute, it is nevertheless
required by the law of Washington.  If either of these be shown, then
evidence of a conviction under Washington law would constitute evidence that
the fugitive's conduct would have amounted to theft under Canadian law.  In
this case, however, the text of the foreign law provided by the requesting
state pursuant to Article 9(2) of the Treaty did not show that the Washington
law required fraudulent intent.  Neither was any expert evidence called on this
issue.

 

                   The
second method of showing that the double criminality requirement had been met
would be to establish that the particular facts underlying the
Washington charge would, if replicated in Canada, constitute an offence under
either s. 283(1)  or s. 290(1)  of the Criminal Code .  This was not done
either.  The facts underlying the Washington charge were laid out in the
affidavits before the extradition judge.  However, the extradition judge did
not find that the facts contained evidence of fraudulent intent.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

                   To sum up, Wilson
J.'s concern was to determine whether the conduct of the accused was an
extradition crime according to the law of Canada.  If it had been shown
that the accused had been convicted in the United States of an offence that
incorporated all the components of a listed crime as defined in Canada, that
would have sufficed.  It would also have been sufficient if it had been
established that the facts underlying the conviction would, if they had been
committed in Canada, constitute a crime listed in the treaty.  In such
circumstances, it would be unnecessary to resort to United States law to find
that the act charged was a crime according to the law of Canada, which
is all the Extradition Act  requires of the extradition judge.  All the
judges in Johnson were agreed on the latter point, and so would have
committed without proof that the crime charged was an offence under the treaty
according to the law of the requesting state.  The majority and the minority
simply disagreed on the facts.

 

                   I should observe
that Nielsen was concerned with an accused person under the British
equivalent of s. 18(1)(b) rather than s. 18(1)(a), but it must be
noted that Lord Diplock in that case was of the same view as Wilson J. as to
the requirements of the equivalent provision to s. 18(1)(a) dealing with
convicts, and, as I see it, their reasons are fundamentally to the same effect. 
Their sole difference is one of judicial method.  Wilson J. in Johnson
deals with the case in terms of underlying principle, the ""double
criminality rule"", as that principle is incorporated in s. 18(1)(a)
of the Act.  Lord Diplock prefers to stick closely to the specific wording of
the comparable provision in the British statute, which he refers to in his
statement in McCaffery, at p. 573, cited supra, as ""the
so-called `double criminality' test"".  I must confess that when dealing
with extradition within the confines of the Extradition Act , I am more
comfortable with the more concrete approach followed by Lord Diplock.  It
avoids confusing the extradition judge about theoretical issues and with
questions that fall outside his functions.  But it really makes no difference. 
At the end of the day, both Wilson J. and Lord Diplock agree with the last
sentence in the quotation from McCaffery which (adapted to Canada)
reads:  ""The right test . . . was whether the conduct of
the accused, if it had been committed in [Canada], would have constituted a
crime falling within one or more of the descriptions included in that
list"".  As already mentioned, this Court has said substantially the same
thing in Mellino and Schmidt.

 

                   In sum, what must
be established is that the act or conduct of the fugitive would,
if it had occurred in Canada, constitute a crime listed in the treaty according
to the law of Canada.  This is so whether the fugitive is merely accused or has
been convicted of the crime.  The definition of ""extradition crime""
and s. 34  of the Extradition Act  require this.  But the manner of
establishing this proposition varies depending on whether the fugitive is a
convict or a mere accused.

 

                   Section 18(1)(a)
was intended to simplify the process of proving that the offence for which a
convict is sought is an extradition crime under the Act.  That will certainly
be the result where the definition of the crime in the foreign state comprises
the same elements as the Canadian crime.  The proposition can then be established
by simply providing the text of the foreign law, as Wilson J. held.  But if
this congruence is absent, the problem becomes somewhat more difficult.  In
that case, the fact that the underlying conduct would be a crime in Canada can
only be demonstrated with proof that the foreign law contains the elements
required under Canadian law, or by establishing that the particular facts show
that the conduct of the fugitive would amount to a crime in Canada; see Nielsen,
supra, at pp. 621-22.

 

Treaty Provisions:  Art. 2(1)

 

                   I now turn to the
authorities dealing with treaty provisions qualifying a state's duty under the
treaty to surrender fugitives.  I shall in particular focus on Art. 2(1), since
it was the one on which the respondent principally relied, but the same
reasoning governs the other relevant provisions.

 

                   So far as I am
aware, the first case to deal with a treaty provision like Art. 2(1) is McCaffery,
supra, where Lord Diplock considered, in obiter, a similar
provision in the treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States. 
Before examining that case it is useful to discuss the genesis of Lord
Diplock's thinking, which appears in a passage in Nielsen, supra,
cited by Sopinka J.

 

                   In Nielsen,
it will be remembered, Lord Diplock, speaking for the House of Lords, held that
barring express treaty provision, all that had to be established at an
extradition hearing was a prima facie case that the fugitive's conduct
in the requesting state would, if committed in England, constitute a listed
crime according to the law of England.  In Nielsen there was no treaty
provision affecting the matter, so the fugitive was committed for surrender. 
In obiter, however, Lord Diplock expressed the view that a treaty may
expressly require proof of foreign law at an extradition hearing, noting that
this would have been the case if the request had been made under the
supplementary treaty with Denmark.  That treaty had simply amended the
principal treaty dealt with in Nielsen by adding the rather unusual
provision (cited by my colleague) to the effect that the parties to the treaty
may in their discretion surrender fugitives for other crimes than those listed
in the treaty, but only in the case where the conduct is an extradition crime
according to the law of both countries.  In such a case, it would be necessary
in Lord Diplock's view to hear evidence of Danish law.  I should in light of
the subsequent developments observe that Lord Diplock's comments qualified the
reasons of Robert Goff L.J. in the Divisional Court (1983), 79 Cr.App.R. 1, of
which he had taken pains to ""record my respectful admiration"" (at p.
620).  In the Divisional Court it had been made plain that the magistrate at an
extradition hearing was not concerned with foreign law at all.  It agreed,
however, that questions of foreign law would, of course, arise before the
Secretary of State, in the course of ensuring compliance with the treaty.

 

                   Shortly afterwards,
in McCaffery, Lord Diplock reiterated his understanding of the law, this
time in relation to a treaty which contained a provision, Art. III(1)(a),
which, like Art. 2(1) of the treaty here, provided that extradition shall be
granted only if ""the offence is punishable under the laws of both Parties
by imprisonment or other form of detention for more than one year
. . . .""  Since it had been established at the extradition
hearing that these two requirements (i.e. that the act was a crime in the
United States and that it was punishable in the manner specified in Art.
III(1)(a)) were satisfied by affidavits, nothing turned on the point. 
That is equally the case here.  No issue is raised that the act charged is not
a crime in California, or that it is punishable there by less than one year's
imprisonment.  All that is in issue, as I noted at the outset, is whether it is
necessary to prove that the act charged constitutes a crime listed in the
treaty under the law of the requesting state.   This, McCaffery decided,
is not necessary, and so if one accepts Nielsen and McCaffery,
that is sufficient to dispose of the present case.

 

                   I do not wish,
however, to rest my decision on this narrow ground alone, for, with all respect
to Lord Diplock, it is not in my view necessary for the extradition judge to be
concerned with foreign law at all even in the face of a clause like Art. 2(1)
of the present treaty.  This is the position taken in the cases that follow.

 

                   Lord Diplock's view
was struck a glancing blow by the House of Lords in Postlethwaite, supra,
at pp. 390-91, a case that involved a clause in the United Kingdom's treaty
with Belgium that prohibited surrender unless the crime was ""punishable
according to the laws in force in both countries"".  The fugitive was
accused of manslaughter in Belgium and it was argued that the expert evidence
of a Belgian lawyer, presented at the extradition hearing to show that
manslaughter remains a crime in Belgium, had not been presented within two
months of the fugitive's arrest as required by the treaty, although an
affidavit to fill ""the supposed lacuna"" had been received in the
Divisional Court proceedings.  Lord Bridge found this contention wholly devoid
of merit.  He began his analysis by expressing doubt about whether this was an
issue for the magistrate at all, saying at p. 390:  ""Assuming that this was
a matter for the magistrate and not for the Secretary of State, which I doubt
but will not take time to consider further . . . .""  The
reason he found it unnecessary to consider the matter in depth was that, in his
view, it could surely be presumed that so serious a crime was punishable.  But
in any event, he held, there was evidence.  That evidence was the Belgian
warrant for his arrest, which set forth the nature of the Belgian offence, and
a deposition by a Belgian official accompanying the requisition that showed
that the offence was contrary to the Belgian Penal Code. Such evidence is, of
course, present in the case at bar.  What one gathers from Postlethwaite
is that the question of whether a crime is one under foreign law is for the
Secretary of State to determine on the basis of the material required under the
treaty to be supplied with the requisition.

 

                   Lord Diplock's obiter
statements were firmly rejected by the House of Lords in the recent case (1991)
of Sinclair, supra, which adopted the view expressed by Robert
Goff L.J. in the Divisional Court in Nielsen, from which Lord Ackner
cited in extenso (at pp. 83-85).  I shall not repeat the cited passages,
which are rather lengthy, but apart from the procedural differences set forth
in the Canadian Act to which I have previously referred, they seem to me to be
wholly in accord with the scheme of extradition in Canada as I have explained
it.  This is scarcely surprising.  As I have been at pains to note, the British
and Canadian Acts are substantially the same, the treaties are the same or
similar, and the relationship between the two Acts and the treaties are the
same.  I might, however, briefly summarize the relevant holdings.  The reasons
are, of course, couched in terms of the English procedure which, in the general
run of things, requires the Secretary of State to consider at the outset
whether the conditions for surrender under the treaty are met.  If the Secretary
of State concludes that these conditions are met, he issues an order to proceed
to the magistrate.  The magistrate then determines whether there is a prima
facie case of conduct which in England would constitute a crime
listed in the Schedule to the Act and the treaty.  In doing this, the
magistrate acts pursuant to English law alone; with the exception of political
offences, for which we saw there are special provisions in the Act, the
magistrate is ""not concerned with foreign law at all"" (at p. 84). 
The task of monitoring the treaty, including whether the requisite materials
have been filed to show that the offence is a crime in the requesting state, is
for the executive, specifically the Secretary of State.  The lawfulness of the
executive's action can, the case observes, be challenged by habeas corpus
proceedings.  The principal difference under Canadian procedure, as we saw, is
that the extradition hearing is conducted without the necessity of an order by
the executive and it more frequently takes place before the formal
requisition.  But the executive has the same function of monitoring the treaty,
and if at any time the Minister of Justice concludes that the treaty
requirements have not been met he or she can discharge the fugitive.  There can
be no doubt, either, that the lawfulness of the Minister's actions can be
reviewed in habeas corpus proceedings and, I would think, by proceedings
in the Federal Court.

 

                   I have left to the
last the only Canadian case in which allusion is made to Art. 2(1), Washington
(State of) v. Johnson, decided by this Court in 1988.  This case, of
course, preceded Sinclair, but it came after Nielsen, McCaffery
and Postlethwaite.  No mention was made of these cases except for an
oblique, and for present purposes irrelevant reference (at p. 344) to Nielsen. 
Wilson J.'s reference to Art. 2(1) is terse, probably because the case was not
really argued in these terms.  All Wilson J. directly says about it (at p. 339)
is as follows:  ""This is the double criminality rule, the precise nature
of which is in issue on this appeal"".  When she deals with the application
of the double criminality rule, she does not concern herself with whether the
crime is one in the requesting state (except under the special procedure
relating to convicts to determine whether the crime of which the fugitive was
convicted would be one under Canadian law).  Still less does she consider
whether it should be the extradition judge or the executive that decides the
issue of whether the act charged is a crime in the requesting state.  She deals
solely with the issue of whether the conduct of the accused would constitute a
crime in Canada, which is all the Extradition Act , upon which she
relied, required her to do.  I add that she would have been prepared to commit
the fugitive had his impugned conduct amounted to a crime against Canadian law,
without reference to United States law.  I repeat:  all she considered, and
this was really the only question before her, was whether the conduct
constituted a crime in Canada.  She held that this was not established and
accordingly concluded that the fugitive should be released.  The minority, for
its part, found that the particular facts revealed an offence under Canadian
law and would have ordered the fugitive's committal on that basis.  In short,
Wilson J., and for that matter the minority judges, did not really consider
whether it was up to the extradition judge, as opposed to the executive, to
consider the foreign law side of the concept of double criminality.

 

                   As I indicated
earlier, I am in entire agreement with the House of Lords decision in Sinclair. 
After all, it is trite law that a treaty is not self-executing except as to
executive functions and matters already provided for by law.  If a change in
the law is required, this must be effected by statute and an analysis of the
statute here shows that there was no intent ‑‑ and generally I may
say that would be unusual ‑‑ to grant the power to a judge to
monitor the obligations undertaken by sovereign states.

 

                   The view that it
falls within the extradition judge's authority to examine whether the offence
charged was one in the requesting state  gives rise to a number of paradoxes. 
Read alone, the Act appears to be concerned with finding that the offences are
punishable according to the law of Canada only.  Clauses like Art. 2(1)
routinely appeared in treaties from the very inception of the Extradition
Act .  A perusal of the early treaties, which are reproduced in the Appendix
to Piggott, supra, reveals that variations of this clause appear in
treaties from a very early stage.  It is surprising, then, that an issue of
this fundamental nature would not have been provided for in the Act.  What is
more, if the clause is intended to make such a fundamental departure from what
appears in the Act, it raises the question why it does not appear in all the
treaties.  This question becomes all the more perplexing because there appears
to be no pattern by which one can divine why such a clause is included in one
treaty and not another.  What reason, for example, can one think of for
subjecting the United States to more serious constraints than other countries
with which Canada has far less close ties?  This mystery is compounded by the
fact that the original treaty with the United States, Art. X of the Treaty
between Her Majesty and the United States of America, to Settle and Define the
Boundaries between the Possessions of Her Britannic Majesty in North America
and the Territories of the United States; for the Final Suppression of the
African Slave Trade; and for the Giving Up of Criminals, Fugitive from Justice,
in Certain Cases (Ashburton-Webster Treaty) (1842), contained no
such clause; see Can. T.S. 1952 No. 12.  Finally, I note that the present
treaty is meant ""to make more effective the co-operation of the two
countries in the repression of crime"".

 

                   These apparent
anomalies disappear if one takes into account that treaties are contracts
between sovereign states and that, except to the extent that the treaty
requires a change in the law of the land, they are administered by the
executive and its officials.  Article 2 does not deal with judicial hearings
but with the duty under the treaty to deliver the fugitive according to
the provisions of the treaty.  If the documents required by Art. 9 are
presented it becomes evident enough that the conduct at issue is a crime in the
foreign state, as required by Art. 2.  But the determination of whether there
is a prima facie case of conduct that is a crime in Canada is, of
course, one for this country to decide.  Given its importance for the freedom
of the individual, this duty was assigned by the Extradition Act  to an
extradition judge, who has the competence to deal with the issue.

 

                   There can be no
doubt that, even without a clause like Art. 2(1), states would insist on
getting material such as that set forth in Art. 9 (e.g., the text of the
foreign law and the warrant of arrest) so that, acting through its officials,
it can determine whether its obligation to surrender in a particular case is
engaged, and the treaties all provide for such material to be supplied with the
requisition.  What Art. 2(1) does is to make the matter explicit.  It really
does not much matter, therefore, whether the clause appears in the treaty or
not, and as we saw no such clause was inserted in about half the treaties
negotiated.  As a practical matter, all it appears to add is the requirement
that the offence be punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year, a matter
that can easily be determined by examining the text of the law the requesting
state is required to supply.

 

Comprehensive Definitions

 

                   In the courts
below, considerable attention was devoted to broad, comprehensive definitions
of double criminality and extradition crimes by specialists in the field. 
Essentially, these definitions say that for a person to be extradited the act
charged must be a crime in the requesting state and be listed or described in
the treaty and fall within the name or description in the treaty as understood
in the requesting state, and it must also be a crime in the requested state
that falls within the name or description of a listed crime in the requested
state.  These broad definitions (descriptions would be a better word) are not
directed solely at the role of the extradition judge, but constitute attempted
descriptions of the general theory behind the whole process ‑‑
prosecutorial, diplomatic and judicial.  Viewed from that perspective, the
definitions are basically sound and are useful as expository tools.  Thus the
act must be a crime in the requesting country.  Why would it prosecute
otherwise?  That originally is a matter for the prosecuting authorities and
ultimately for the courts of the demanding state, here the United States. 
Similarly, officials in the State Department in the United States must conclude
that the act charged falls within the treaty according to the laws of that
country.  They are unfamiliar with our laws.  The requested state will
naturally wish to monitor the treaty to ensure that its obligations are
engaged, and for that purpose the requesting state is required by the treaty to
supply documentation enabling the requested state to do so.  The act charged
must also be a crime in the requested state, Canada, that is listed or
described in the treaty according to our law ‑‑ the so-called
double criminality rule.  This is the component ‑‑ and barring
express provision, the only component ‑‑ of the comprehensive
definition of extradition crime that is left to be decided by the extradition
judge.  That jurisdiction is assigned to the extradition judge by s. 18  of the Extradition
Act .  That function, as I noted, is very limited, but critically
important.  It ensures that no one shall be extradited from this country unless
a judge is satisfied that person has been convicted of an act (or there is prima
facie evidence that he or she has committed an act) that, if it had
occurred in this country, would be a crime here that is described in the
treaty.  The notion that the extradition judge should be concerned with foreign
law, and so determine all the questions involved in the theoretical description
of the process of extradition, results from the fallacy that originally began
with the practice adopted in Re Bellencontre and Re Arton (No. 2),
supra, for which, as Lord Diplock noted, no justification was offered. 
The editor of La Forest's Extradition, 3rd ed., Anne W.
La Forest, succinctly describes the role of the comprehensive definition
there given as follows, at p. 51:

 

                   The
foregoing discussion is at the level of general principle.  It says nothing
about process, more specifically about what institution or body determines
whether any of the components in the above definition has been satisfied.  For
many years, the leading authorities appeared to indicate that the judge at an
extradition hearing was involved in each of these components.  This misconception,
for that is what it was, is of respectful antiquity, dating back to two
well-known late nineteenth century cases, Re Bellencontre and Re
Arton (No. 2), and particularly the latter.

 

She makes it clear throughout that all
the extradition judge is concerned with is to determine that there is prima
facie evidence that the conduct with which the accused is charged in the
requesting state would, if committed in Canada, constitute a crime listed in
the treaty.

 

                   I might perhaps be
permitted to add that in preparing the earlier editions of that work in a pre-Nielsen
context, I could not ignore what appeared to be the dominant (in England the
accepted) approach arising from Bellencontre and Arton (No. 2),
but it can scarcely be said that I thought the approach was correct.  I argued
on similar lines as I have adopted in these reasons that proof of foreign law
was not required by the Act, and that if the course I suggested were adopted it
would considerably simplify the substantive law (including the elimination of
problems such as the one that has arisen in the present case); see 1st ed., pp.
37, 72; 2nd ed., pp. 52, 109-110.  The matter may not have been of as much
concern in the more leisurely period when the approach in Bellencontre
and Arton (No. 2) was dominant and extradition cases were few.  But
extradition is today very frequently sought.  And with the exponential growth
of international crime that has since taken place, it would now be an easy task
for criminal enterprises to frustrate the operation of the extradition laws,
mutually set up by states to combat criminal activities, by flying in a battery
of experts on foreign law whenever one of the entrepreneurs in these unsavoury
operations was in danger of being brought to justice.  Sopinka J. suggests that
proof of foreign law is made in many trials involving transnational
activities.  But extradition proceedings are not trials.  They are intended to
be expeditious procedures to determine whether a trial should be held; even the
evidence against the fugitive is presented in writing without the benefit of
cross-examination.

 

                   I have thus
concluded that the evidence of foreign law in the present case should not have
been admitted by the extradition judge and was irrelevant.  The issue of
whether the act charged was a crime under United States law was for the
prosecutors in the United States to decide, and it was for them and the U.S.
State Department to assess whether in their view it came within the treaty,
subject to monitoring by Canada pursuant to the treaty.  The monitoring task
has not, for good reason, been assigned to the extradition judge, so it remains
with the executive.  Barring the possible exception of political offences, only
one task has been assigned to the judiciary, but it is an important one ‑‑
the task of assessing whether there is sufficient evidence that the alleged
offence would, if committed in Canada, constitute a crime mentioned in the
treaty.  That is the duty conferred upon the extradition judge by the Extradition
Act .

 

                   I might add that
the evidence of American law in this case was not only irrelevant; it was
misplaced.  The issue is not whether the crime charged is called forgery or not
in either country, but whether the conduct charged can fairly be said to fall
within the expressions ""forgery"" and ""conspiracy"" in the
treaty.  In considering this issue, it must be remembered that the crimes
listed in the treaty are not to be interpreted according to the niceties of the
applicable legislation of either country.  Rather they are described in
compendious terms to catch broad categories of conduct; see La Forest's
Extradition, 3rd ed., at p. 76, and the cases there cited.  In other words,
extradition crimes are described in a comprehensive and generic sense.  No
doubt if the American authorities proceeded on too broad a basis, the matter
could be raised at the diplomatic level.  As Lord Ackner noted in Sinclair,
supra, at p. 89, the task of monitoring the treaties is an executive,
and not a judicial, function.  However, I must say that it would lie ill in the
mouth of Canada to say to the United States that the act charged does not fall
within the genus of forgery, when in this country it falls within the
definition of forgery under Canadian law.  I fail to understand why the fugitive
would be better protected if the crime was also specifically called forgery in
the United States.  As has frequently been stated, it is the essence of the
offence that is important; see, for example, Cotroni v. Attorney General of
Canada, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 219, at p. 222.

 

                   What has just been
said is consistent with the frequently repeated principle that the fine or nice
distinctions of criminal law are out of place in the law of extradition.  This
Court put the matter bluntly in Mellino, supra, at p. 551:

 

                   In
assessing the issue, a court must not overlook that extradition proceedings
must be approached with a view to conform with Canada's international
obligations.  The courts have on many occasions reiterated that the
requirements and technicalities of the criminal law apply only to a limited
extent in extradition proceedings.

 

To act differently here would take us
back to the approach followed in England in the 19th century when the judges by
a strict and narrow interpretation frustrated the operation of the few
extradition treaties it had entered into.  The British Act of 1870, on which
ours is modelled, was intended to change this approach.  Lord Diplock explains
this in Nielsen, supra, at pp. 614-15.  He states:

 

                   It
is, however, appropriate at this juncture to draw attention to the fact that
when one is describing crimes committed in a foreign state that are regarded in
the United Kingdom as serious enough to warrant extradition of an offender by
whom they have been committed, one is describing the way in which human beings
have conducted themselves and their state of mind at the time of such conduct. 
Since conduct of those kinds consists of wicked things that people do in real
life it is possible to describe them either in broad generic terms and using
popular language, or in varying degrees of specificity, as had been done in
minute detail, nine years before the Act of 1870 itself was passed, in the five
Acts that had been passed in 1861, consolidating and amending the statute law
of England relating to criminal offences of larceny, malicious injuries to
property, forgery, coinage and offences against the person respectively.  These
Acts condescended to minute detail in their descriptions of numerous distinct
offences included within the broad genus of crimes with which, as their titles
indicate, each Act dealt.  Between them the five Acts ran into 380 sections.

 

                   The
1870 list uses the former technique.  It describes each of the list of 19
""extradition crimes"" in general terms and popular language,
irrespective of whether (as the introductory words of Schedule 1 to the Act of
1870 make clear) the conduct described is rendered criminal by common law or by
statute made before or after the passing of the Act of 1870.  So the
1870 list covered all offences under the five consolidating and amending Acts
of 1861 that fell within any of the 19 genera of conduct described in the list;
and also any criminal offence created by any subsequent statute but only if it
fell within a described genus.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

                   As noted earlier,
barring specific exceptions, it is beyond the jurisdiction of an extradition
judge to examine foreign law, and, apart from the present, I know of no case
where there has been a refusal to commit because it had not been established
before the extradition judge that the act charged was a crime listed in the
treaty as interpreted under foreign law.  It would be ironic if this were to be
done at this late juncture in respect of a treaty entered into ""to make
more effective the co-operation of the two countries in the repression of
crime"".  Particularly is this so when states are moving away from including
a list of crimes in treaties but rather agree to surrender for any criminal act
of which a person is charged in the requesting state if it is also a crime in
the requested state.  Canada and the United States have now entered such a
""no list"" treaty; see Can. T.S. 1991 No. 37.  This development comes
from a realization that what is really important is that a person should not be
surrendered to another country for conduct that is not considered a serious
crime in the requested country.  If that basic and important task is done, and
prosecution for other offences is barred following surrender, I see no reason
to complicate the extradition process by requiring proof of foreign law before
the extradition judge.  The monitoring of the treaty to ensure compliance by
the foreign state with the treaty obligations  can safely be left to the
executive, as the Canadian scheme of extradition contemplates.  It should be
observed, however, that Art. 2(1) in the new treaty is much the same as in the
treaty at issue here: if my colleague's view of that provision is accepted,
then, the contracting parties have not yet succeeded in avoiding proof of
foreign law at the extradition hearing.

 

Disposition

 

                   Dohm J. concluded
that there was evidence of conduct in the United States that would be
sufficient to commit the accused for the crimes of conspiracy and forgery under
the law of Canada, crimes listed in the treaty.  This he held was sufficient to
warrant the committal of the respondent, and he refused to consider evidence of
United States law.  He therefore ordered the committal of the respondent for
surrender.  In doing this he was, in my view, perfectly right.  I would
therefore allow the appeal, set aside the decisions of the Court of Appeal and
the judge on habeas corpus, and restore the order of committal.

 

                                                                    II

 

United States of America v. Charles
Julius McVey (21751)

 

                   The judgment of
La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and Cory JJ. was delivered by

 

//La Forest J.//

 

                   La
Forest J. -- This appeal
raises the same basic issue as the companion case between the same parties,
issued concurrently, i.e., whether in an extradition hearing it is
necessary to prove that the act charged constitutes a crime listed in the
extradition treaty under the law of the state requesting the surrender of the
fugitive.

 

                   The respondent was
indicted by a grand jury in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California on January 26, 1988.  Counts 5 through 12 of the
indictment charged that McVey, in concert with others, knowingly and
intentionally devised and participated in a scheme to defraud Saxpy Computer
Corporation of, inter alia, ""its right to the exclusive use of its
property, to wit, confidential, proprietary information regarding the design
and operation of the Saxpy Matrix-1 Super Computer"", which scheme was
executed by the use of ""wire communication"".  The use of the
interstate telephone system brought the offences into United States federal
jurisdiction.

 

                   Extradition
proceedings to secure the surrender of the respondent to the United States were
initiated in the Supreme Court of British Columbia and an extradition hearing
was held before Macdonell J.  There was, in his view, ample evidence to have
warranted a committal for trial if the offence had been committed in Canada. 
The comparable crime in Canada was contained in what is now s. 380  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (then s. 338 ), which prohibits everyone from
defrauding by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, the public or any
person of any property, money or valuable security.  Macdonell J. found that
this offence, or at least a conspiracy to commit it, was listed in the
Canada-United States extradition treaty, apparently under item 27, i.e.,
use of a means of communication in connection with schemes to defraud the public
or for the purpose of obtaining property by false pretences.  The relevant
point for our purposes is that he also heard and accepted the evidence of an
expert on United States law to the effect that while the grand jury court
indictment referred to defrauding the Saxpy Computer Corporation, nevertheless
Saxpy was under American law a member of the public, thereby bringing the
charge within the language of the treaty.  In the result, all conditions for
the extradition of the respondent were made out and Macdonell J. ordered his
committal for surrender.

 

                   On an application
for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, Paris J.
expressed substantial agreement with Macdonell J.  On the appeal to the British
Columbia Court of Appeal, that court agreed that the respondent's conduct would
constitute a crime in Canada, but differed with the courts below on the United
States law.  In its view, the expert evidence did not establish that the
accused could be convicted in that country of a scheme to defraud the public
when the evidence was that the scheme was aimed at one person, the Saxpy
corporation.  The expert witness, it stated, had never spoken directly on that
issue.  In the absence of proof of foreign law, the court held that such law
must be presumed to be the same as Canadian law, and in its view Canadian law
would not regard one corporation as ""the public"".  Consequently, the
respondent's conduct did not fall within item 27 of the crimes listed in the
treaty under the law of the United States.

 

                   On the appeal to
this Court, the appellant's major ground is that the Court of Appeal erred in
holding that an extradition crime must be listed in the treaty according to the
law of the United States as well as according to Canadian law.  For the reasons
set forth in the companion case, the appellant is entitled to succeed on this
ground.  The appellant established a prima facie case of an extradition
crime, i.e., conduct that if committed in Canada would be a crime listed
in the treaty according to the law of Canada.  That being so, the extradition
judge was required to commit the respondent under s. 18(1)(b) of the Extradition
Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. E-23, read in conjunction with s. 2 (the definition
of an ""extradition crime"") and s. 34 .  The procedure mandated by
these provisions protects the accused against being surrendered to another
country for conduct not regarded as criminal in Canada.  Along with the treaty
provision that the offence for which the fugitive is surrendered is the only
offence for which, under the treaty, he can be prosecuted in the requesting
state, the accused is adequately protected.  As such, there is no point to a
review of foreign law by the extradition judge, and as Argentina v. Mellino,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 536, at pp. 554-55, reminds us, it is not the business of that
judge to assume responsibility for reviewing the decisions of the officials and
judicial authorities in the foreign state.

 

                   Having come to this
conclusion on the major ground of appeal, it becomes unnecessary, indeed inappropriate,
to consider the issue regarding the conflict of opinion between the Court of
Appeal and the extradition and habeas corpus judges over the
interpretation of United States law.  The several other subsidiary issues
raised by the respondent were summarily dismissed from the Bench.

 

                   I would allow the
appeal, reverse the decision of the Court of Appeal and restore the order of
committal.

Justice McLachlin.

 

//McLachlin J.//

 

                   McLachlin J. ‑‑ We are all of the view
that the appeal should be allowed.  It was for the trial judge to determine
whether the evidence, which was tendered solely on the basis of credibility,
demonstrated a degree of relevance which outweighed its prejudicial value. 
After considering the motion on record and the submissions of counsel, he
concluded that it did not.  In doing so, he committed no error of law.

 

                   In the absence of
an indication that the complainant's evidence on collateral matters might be
false, the claim for its relevance was tenuous.  On the other hand, its
prejudice and its potential to mislead the jurors was significant.  The words
of this Court in R. v. Meddoui, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 320, at pp. 320‑21,
are relevant.  There Sopinka J. stated:

 

                   With
respect to the ground relating to cross‑examination, the proposed line of
questioning related to a collateral matter.  Furthermore, its relevance was
extremely tenuous and while wide latitude is permitted in cross‑examination
in a criminal case, the trial judge properly exercised his discretion in
excluding the cross‑examination.

 

                   The appeal is
allowed and the convictions are restored.  The matters are remitted to the

on appeal from the court of appeal for
manitoba

for cause on the ground of partiality ‑‑ Judge not permitting
questions to be put to all prospective jurors ‑‑ Whether accused

publicity ‑‑ Accused seeking to challenge each prospective juror
for cause on the ground of partiality ‑‑ Judge not permitting
questions to be put to all prospective jurors ‑‑ Whether accused
properly denied right to challenge.

 

                   Appellant was
convicted of killing of a pimp.  Media publicity was given to the search for
and the location of the victim's body, his background and identity, and his
involvement in certain killings in the United States.  The accused's background
was also the subject of some media speculation.  These reports occurred
approximately nine to ten months prior to the trial of the accused.  The
accused sought to challenge for cause each potential juror because of the
potential for partiality arising from the pre‑trial publicity and had
prepared a list of eleven questions to be asked of each member of the jury
panel.  This general challenge was rejected by the trial judge and an appeal to
the Court of Appeal was dismissed.  At issue here is whether the accused was
properly denied the ability to challenge each prospective juror for cause on
the ground of partiality.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé, Sopinka,
Gonthier, and Cory JJ.:  The jury must perform its duties impartially and
represent the larger community as far as is possible and appropriate in the
circumstances.

 

                   The fundamental
right to a fair and proper trial is denied where the accused is not allowed to
challenge any number of jurors for cause when the grounds of challenge are
properly specified.  Counsel is entitled to determine whether any potential
juror is, by reason of the pretrial publicity and the notoriety of the
appellant, sufficiently impartial.  The trial judge cannot, in the exercise of
his discretion in the area of admitting grounds of challenge for cause and
settling the questions, effectively curtail the statutory right to challenge
for cause.  That trial judges have a wide discretion in these matters and that
jurors will usually behave in accordance with their oaths cannot supercede the
right of every accused person to a fair trial, which necessarily includes the
empanelling of an impartial jury.

 

                   An accused does not
have the right to a favourable jury and the selection procedure cannot be used
to thwart the representativeness that is essential to the proper functioning of
a jury.  Peremptory challenges, however, are justified on a number of grounds
even though they, along with the Crown's right to stand aside, can be used to
alter somewhat the degree to which the jury represents the community.  Challenges
for cause are properly used to rid the jury of prospective members who are not
indifferent or who otherwise fall within s. 567  of the
Criminal Code , but
they stray into illegitimacy if used merely, without more, to over‑ or
under‑represent a certain class in society or as a ""fishing
expedition"" in order to obtain personal information about the juror. 
Information obtained on an ultimately unsuccessful challenge for cause may,
however, lead the challenger to exercise the right to challenge peremptorily or
to stand aside the particular juror.

 

                   The issue raised in
a challenge for cause is tried by a ""mini‑jury"" of two jurors
or two prospective jurors if no jurors have been sworn.  Section 567  of the
Criminal Code  places
little, if any, burden on the challenger.  On the other hand, a reasonable
degree of control must be retained by the trial judge and, thus, some burden
placed upon the challenger to ensure that the selection of the jury occurs in a
manner that is in accordance with the principles here articulated and also to
ensure that sufficient information is imparted to the trial judge such that the
trial of the truth of the challenge is contained within permissible bounds. 
Thus, while there must be an ""air of reality"" to the application, it
need not be an ""extreme"" case.  The real question to be decided here
was whether the particular publicity and notoriety of the accused could
potentially have the effect of destroying the prospective juror's indifference
between the Crown and the accused.

 

                   A valuable
distinction might be drawn in pre‑trial publicity cases between mere
publication of the facts of a case and situations where the media misrepresents
the evidence, dredges up and widely publicizes discreditable incidents from an
accused's past or engages in speculation as to the accused's guilt or
innocence.  It may well be that the pre‑trial publicity or other ground
of alleged partiality will, in itself, provide sufficient reasons for a
challenge for cause.  The threshold question is not whether the ground of
alleged partiality will create such partiality in a juror, but rather whether
it could create that partiality which would prevent a juror from being
indifferent as to the result.  In the end, there must exist a realistic potential
for the existence of partiality, on a ground sufficiently articulated in the
application, before the challenger should be allowed to proceed.

 

                   Per Stevenson J.:  Concurrence with the
reasons and disposition of L'Heureux‑Dubé J. was restricted to the main
ground of the appeal:  whether the trial judge had usurped the function of
triers of facts in dealing with challenges for cause.  Where counsel seeks to
invoke the right to challenge each juror the trial judge is to be satisfied
that there is some foundation to the challenge.  Here the challenge for cause
on the basis of pre‑trial publicity was groundless.  Giving some rational
basis for exercising the peremptory challenge is not a permissible ground for
challenging for cause.

J.//

 

                   The judgment of
L'Heureux-Dubé, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory and Stevenson JJ. was delivered by

 

                   L'Heureux-Dubé
J. -- The sole issue
raised by this case is the proper interpretation of the challenge for cause
provisions found in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  More specifically, the
question is whether the accused in this case was properly denied the ability to
challenge each prospective juror for cause on the ground of partiality or, in
the words of the section, non-indifference.

 

Facts

 

                   The accused was
charged and convicted in the killing of a pimp by the name of Tommy T.  The
nature of the dispute between the two men and the facts surrounding the actual
killing of Tommy T. are not in issue here.  Of importance to the legal question
raised are the facts surrounding the search for the victim's body.

 

                   The crime was
committed in Winnipeg, Manitoba, but the accused was picked up for questioning
in Dryden, Ontario.  On this occasion, he informed the police that he had
killed Tommy T.  A more detailed statement was given by the accused upon
questioning by the Winnipeg police authorities.  He told the police about the
nature of the dispute between the two men and described the circumstances
surrounding the actual killing.  According to the accused's statement to the
Winnipeg police, he had disposed of the body in a commercial garbage bin. 
Unfortunately, by the time the accused was transported back to Manitoba, the
bin in question had been emptied.  As a result, the police searched the local
land fill site in hopes of locating the body.  This search was the subject of
some publicity by the media.  The media raised questions about the location of
the body and about the background and identity of the victim and his
involvement in certain killings in the United States.  The background of the
accused was also apparently the subject of some media speculation.  The reports
in the media occurred approximately nine to ten months prior to the trial of
the accused.

 

                   It is against this
factual background that the legal question must be analyzed.

 

Relevant statutory provisions

 

                   Narrowly, only
Criminal Code  s.
567(1) (b)
(now s. 638(1) (b))
is relevant to the disposition in this case.  However, for ease of reference
and in the interest of clarity, I will set out other Criminal Code  provisions regarding the empanelling
of a jury in the criminal context. 

 

Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, as am.:

 

                   554. (1) A person who is qualified as a
juror according to, and summoned as a juror in accordance with, the laws of a
province is qualified to serve as a juror in criminal proceedings in that
province.

 

                   562. (1)  An accused who is charged with
high treason or first degree murder is entitled to challenge twenty jurors
peremptorily.

 

                   (2)
An accused who is charged with an offence, not being high treason or first
degree murder, for which he may be sentenced to imprisonment for more than five
years is entitled to challenge twelve jurors peremptorily.

 

                   (3)
An accused who is charged with an offence that is not referred to in subsection
(1) or (2) is entitled to challenge four jurors peremptorily.

 

                   563. (1)  The prosecutor is entitled to
challenge four jurors peremptorily, and may direct any number of jurors who are
not challenged peremptorily by the accused to stand by until all the jurors
have been called who are available for the purpose of trying the indictment.

 

                   (2)
Notwithstanding subsection (1), the prosecutor may not direct more than
forty-eight jurors to stand by unless the presiding judge for special cause to
be shown, so orders.

 

                   (3)
The accused may be called upon to declare whether he challenges a juror
peremptorily or for cause before the prosecutor is called upon to declare
whether he requires the juror to stand by, or challenges him peremptorily or
for cause.

 

                   567. (1)  A prosecutor or an accused is
entitled to any number of challenges on the ground that

 

(a) the name of the juror does not
appear on the panel, but no misnomer or misdescription is a ground of challenge
where it appears to the court that the description given on the panel
sufficiently designates the person referred to,

 

(b) a juror is not indifferent
between the Queen and the accused, 

 

(c) a juror has been convicted of an
offence for which he was sentenced to death or to a term of imprisonment
exceeding twelve months,

 

(d) a juror is an alien,

 

(e) a juror is physically unable to
perform properly the duties of a juror, or

 

                                                                   .
. . 

 

                   (2)
No challenge for cause shall be allowed on a ground not mentioned in subsection
(1).

 

                   569. (1) Where the ground of a challenge
is that the name of a juror does not appear on the panel, the issue shall be
tried by the judge on the voir dire by the inspection of the panel, and
such other evidence that the judge thinks fit to receive.

 

                   (2)
Where the ground of a challenge is one not mentioned in subsection (1), the two
jurors who were last sworn, or if no jurors have then been sworn, two persons
present whom the court may appoint for the purpose, shall be sworn to determine
whether the ground of challenge is true.

 

                   (3)
Where the finding, pursuant to subsection (1) or (2) is that the ground of
challenge is not true, the juror shall be sworn, but if the finding is that the
ground of challenge is true, the juror shall not be sworn.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Judgments

 

Court
of Queen's Bench
(Jewers J.)

 

                   At trial, in May,
1988, counsel for the accused informed the judge that he wished to challenge
for cause each prospective juror on the ground that they were not
""indifferent between the Queen and the accused"".  The allegation of
potential partiality was based upon the pre-trial publicity described above. 
Counsel for the accused had prepared a list of eleven questions which he
desired to put to each member of the jury panel.  He argued that the
speculation in the media went to the background and character of the accused
and, hence, could prove prejudicial absent individual questioning of the
prospective jurors on the basis of the eleven questions.

 

                   The Crown responded
that the pre-trial publicity could not form the basis for the accused's
challenge as it had occurred some nine or ten months prior to trial.  Further,
it was the Crown's contention that the media reports were not prejudicial as
they failed to establish any connection between the search and discovery of the
body of Tommy T. and the arrest of the accused.

 

                   The trial judge was
not persuaded by the arguments of the accused and rejected the general
challenge on the ground of partiality.  He concluded in this fashion:

 

                   Well,
in this particular case, first of all I don't really have any evidence as to the
type or the extent of the publicity that was given to this case, unless I can
take judicial notice of it which I do not think I can do.

 

                   However
I am not persuaded on the basis of what has been told to me that there has
been so much publicity about the case, and in particular so much publicity
about the notoriety surrounding the accused, that this is a case which would
call for the questioning of jurors prior to their being sworn in.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   I
am just not persuaded that this is a case where we should go to the
extraordinary process of questioning the jurors, and so the application is
dismissed.

 

                   Of
course if there is some specific reason to challenge a jury on the grounds of
impartiality or lack of impartiality, or any other reason, I naturally would be
prepared to entertain that. . . . [Emphasis added.]

 

Court
of Appeal (Huband
J.A. for the majority, O'Sullivan J.A. in dissent) (1989), 58 Man. R. (2d) 145

 

                   On appeal to the
Court of Appeal, the accused alleged a number of errors in the trial judge's
charge to the jury.  Since this is an appeal as of right, arising out of the
dissent on a point of law at the Court of Appeal, none of these issues is
relevant here.  As stated at the outset, the only issue in this appeal is the
propriety of the procedure adopted by the trial judge regarding the accused's
request to challenge for cause each prospective juror on the basis of
partiality.

 

                   The majority of the
Court of Appeal considered at length the argument of the accused that the trial
judge should have allowed individual questioning of the prospective jurors
rather than acceding to the request of the Crown that, in the circumstances of
the case, the alleged partiality was properly dealt with through a general
admonition by the trial judge.  Huband J.A., for the majority, pointed out that
the trial judge: (1) did not close the challenge procedure off completely but
held that challenges on ""proper"" grounds could proceed, (2) told all
members of the panel that if any of them had formed a steadfast opinion about
the guilt or innocence of the accused, they should excuse themselves and, (3)
only after this instruction allowed the selection to begin.

 

                   In concluding that
the accused could not succeed on this ground, the majority relied heavily upon
the reasons of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Hubbert (1975), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 279, and this
Court's subsequent endorsement of those reasons found at [1977] 2 S.C.R. 267. 
Huband J.A. noted that in Hubbert, supra, the Ontario Court of
Appeal reasoned that pre-trial publicity should not normally form the basis of
a general challenge for cause.  At p. 150 the majority stated:

 

                   Relying
upon the Hubbert case, the learned trial judge was right in exercising
his discretion to refuse challenge for cause on the basis of pretrial
publicity.  He was right to refuse to allow challenge on the basis of the other
questions contained on the list, since, in the main, these matters were covered
by his general remarks.  In controlling the process as he did, in my opinion
the learned trial judge did not interfere in any way with the right of the
accused to a fair trial before an impartial jury.

 

                   Huband J.A. went on
to discuss the case law subsequent to Hubbert, supra.  He noted
that this Court's reasons in R. v. Barrow, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 694, might be construed as
limiting the reasons of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Hubbert, supra. 
The majority concluded, however, that Barrow, supra, should not
be read in this fashion.

 

                   O'Sullivan J.A., in
dissent, disagreed with the majority's interpretation of this Court's reasons
in Barrow, supra, and held that the trial judge proceeded
improperly in rejecting the general challenge by the accused.  He also felt
that the majority failed to consider adequately what was said by the Quebec
Court of Appeal in R. v. Guérin and Pimparé (1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 231.  O'Sullivan J.A.
quoted extensively from the three opinions rendered in Guérin and Pimparé,
supra, and concluded that they cast doubt on the propriety of the
procedure adopted in the present case.  In attempting to reconcile what he felt
were the conflicting judgments in Barrow, supra, Guérin and Pimparé, supra,
and Hubbert, supra, O'Sullivan J.A. stated, at p. 155:

 

                   If
the law were left in the state where the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled one way
and the Quebec Court of Appeal ruled another, I would have been inclined to
follow the Ontario Court of Appeal supported as it is by the remarks of the
Supreme Court itself in dismissing the appeal from it. . . . 

 

                   However,
I am confronted with the judgment of Dickson, C.J.C. ... 

 

                   It
is true that it may be said that what Dickson, C.J.C., said in Barrow,
supra, is obiter dictum; it is nevertheless entitled to our respect and we
should follow the dicta in the absence of some special reason not to do so.

 

                   O'Sullivan J.A., in
reliance on his interpretation of Barrow, supra, concluded that the trial judge
was indeed in error in rejecting the requested challenge in this case and would
have ordered a new trial.

 

Issues

 

                   While the appellant
sets out three issues arising from the dissent at the Court of Appeal, they all
have at their core the proper interpretation and application of the challenge
for cause provisions of the Criminal Code .  Therefore, as I mentioned at the outset, this
is the sole issue that will be addressed in these reasons.

 

Analysis

 

The
Criminal Code  Procedure Regarding the Empanelling of a Jury

 

                   In order to place
the issue raised by this case within its proper context, I will examine the
Criminal Code 
provisions governing the empanelling of juries.  Prior, however, to this
discussion I will briefly describe the role of provincial legislation in the
area of jury selection.

 

                   Jury selection has
both federal and provincial aspects.  Section 91(27)  of the
Constitution Act, 1867 
gives Parliament jurisdiction over ""The Criminal Law"" including
""the Procedure in Criminal Matters.""  Section 92(14)  awards to the
provinces jurisdiction over ""The Administration of Justice in the
Province"".  ""Out-of-court"" selection, i.e., selection of those
individuals who are able to serve as jurors, is typically governed by the
provincial Jury Acts.  (For a good summary of provincial legislation in this
regard see Schulman and Myers, ""Jury Selection"", in
Studies on the Jury,
Law Reform Commission of Canada (1979), at p. 395.)  Jurisdictional conflict in
this area is avoided through s. 554(1)  (now s. 626 ) of the
Criminal Code  which
provides that the jury panel will be selected from lists drawn up according to
the relevant provincial legislation.

 

                   The
""in-court"" selection procedure is a matter falling within the
jurisdiction of Parliament and is dealt with at length in the
Criminal Code .  This
Court has previously considered the respective ability of the provinces and
Parliament to legislate in this area in R. v. Barrow, supra.

 

                   In setting out a
summary of the Criminal Code  provisions I have gained a large measure of
assistance from the work of Salhany, Canadian
Criminal Procedure
(5th ed.)  (See also ""The Jury in the Criminal Trial"" by Alan Gold in
Vincent M. Del Buono, ed., Criminal Procedure in Canada)  Immediately
after an accused has pleaded to the charge the empanelling of a jury begins. 
Very simply, if no successful challenge is made to the initial array, the names
of the jurors will be drawn at random.  As each prospective juror is called,
either the accused or the Crown can challenge the juror, either peremptorily or
for cause, or the Crown can direct the juror to stand aside.  If no successful
challenge is made and neither side exercises its ability to reject or stand
aside, the juror will be sworn.  The form of challenge that we are concerned
with here, a challenge to the poll, is a challenge directed against individual
jurors.  This type of challenge can be either peremptory, without any grounds,
or for cause.

 

                   Section 562 (now s.
633) of the Criminal Code  deals with peremptory challenges by an accused. 
It provides that an accused has a varying number of peremptory challenges
depending upon the nature of the sentence that can be imposed.  An accused
charged with high treason or first degree murder is allowed twenty peremptory
challenges.  If the offence charged is not caught by the above category but is
one for which imprisonment for a term greater than five years is possible, the
accused is allowed 12 peremptory challenges.  Any accused not falling within
the two previous categories is allowed four peremptory challenges.

 

                   The ability of the
Crown to challenge peremptorily or, alternatively, stand aside jurors, is found
in s. 563(1) (now s. 634(1)) of the Code.  While the Crown can only challenge
peremptorily four times, it is allowed to stand aside 48 jurors.  The ability
of the Crown to stand aside jurors is, in some respects, similar to an
accused's ability to challenge for cause except that the challenge is postponed
until it is determined that a full jury cannot be formed without those asked to
stand aside.  The right of the Crown to stand aside jurors, though it appears
somewhat anomalous in the present legislative scheme, finds its origin in the
fact that, at common law, the Crown was given no ability to challenge
peremptorily.  (The Law Reform Commission of Canada in The
Jury in Criminal Trials,
Working Paper 27, 1980, recommended the abolition of ""stand-asides"",
to be replaced with peremptory challenges in the same number as is allowed the
accused in any given case.)

 

                   Section 563(3) (now
s. 634(3)) of the Code provides that the accused must determine whether he or she will
challenge a juror for cause or otherwise before the Crown can be called upon to
make a decision as regards the particular juror.

 

                   As far as
challenges for cause are concerned, both the accused and the Crown have a
theoretically unlimited ability to challenge for cause.  Section 567(1)  (now s.
638(1)) sets out the exclusive grounds upon which a challenge for cause can be
made.  Under s. 569 (now s. 640) the trial of the truth of the challenge for
cause is heard by the last two jurors sworn.  If no jurors have yet been sworn,
then two prospective jurors are appointed by the Court to hear and decide the
challenge.  If these triers decide that the challenge is valid, the juror will
not be sworn.  If, however, they find that the challenge is groundless, the
juror must be sworn unless either side decides to exercise a peremptory
challenge or stand aside.  The decision of the triers is final and no appeal
lies therefrom.

 

                   This, in brief, is
the larger context within which a challenge for cause can arise.  This context
and the proper interpretation of the text of the legislation governing the
empanelling procedure are important in a resolution of the question before this
Court.  The bare words of the provisions provide little guidance, however,
without an examination of the history and principles underlying them.

 

The Evolution of the Modern Jury

 

                   A brief overview of
the evolution of the jury serves to bring into sharp relief the important
functions that juries serve.  These functions and the principles that inform
them play a crucial role in the consideration of the issue presently before
this Court.

 

                   While the exact
origin of the jury, as we now know it, is difficult to trace, it is commonly
believed that most early societies possessed some sort of adjudicative
structure similar in form and purpose to that which serves our system today. 
Moore, in a comprehensive examination of the history of the jury, The
Jury, Tool of Kings, Palladium of Liberty, records the use of jury-like bodies as early as
the time of Solon in the 7th and 6th centuries B.C.  The most democratic of
these early institutions were the Athenian general assemblies.  The forebearer
of our modern jury, however, is widely thought to be the Frankish
inquisitio whereby
local men, with knowledge of the matter in dispute, swore to tell the truth
upon a question put to them by the judge.  Only matters in which the Crown had
an interest were resolved in this fashion.  Subsequent English influence
moulded this Crown-controlled instrument into what it is today.  Moore,
supra, summarizes
this later history, at p. 14:

 

                   The
inquisitio of the
Franks had its accusatory aspects (which anticipated our modern grand jury) and
its civil aspects, which was a mode of proof by inquisition or interrogation. 
The next step in the evolution of the trial jury was the Anglo-Norman jury of
proof.  The jurors themselves were the witnesses and they were the mode of
proof.  . . .  The final step in the jury's development was the judgment jury
which came into being in England in the fourteenth century.  In this last step,
the jury, instead of being a mode of proof, chose between the proofs or
evidence offered by the parties.

 

                   Interestingly,
early juries were chosen for their knowledge of the issue whereas, at present,
such knowledge and the pre-judgment that may accompany it might very well lead
to disqualification.  However, as the function of the jury evolved and its
domain narrowed, principles not unlike those underlying our challenge procedure
evolved.  (See Moore, supra, at p. 56;  Baker, An Introduction to English Legal
History, at pp.
64-66; Schulman and Myers, supra, at p. 423, and Devlin, Trial by Jury, at p. 67).

 

                   Moore informs us
that much of what constitutes our present procedure in challenging prospective
jurors and the grounds upon which such challenges could take place developed in
the 16th and 17th centuries in England.  Thus, the number of challenges, the
types of challenge allocated to each party and the grounds upon which such
challenges could be based were formalized early in the modern development of
the jury. (See also Schulman and Myers, supra, at pp. 425-28.)

 

                   Importantly, the
development of the institution known as the jury and the process through which
it came to be selected was neither fortuitous nor arbitrary but proceeded upon
the strength of a certain vision of the role that that body should play.  Most
of the early rationales for the use of the jury are as compelling today as they
were centuries ago while other, more modern, rationales have developed.  The
Law Reform Commission of Canada in its 1980 Working Paper, The
Jury in Criminal Trials,
sets out numerous rationales for the past and continued existence of the jury. 
The jury, through its collective decision making, is an excellent fact finder;
due to its representative character, it acts as the conscience of the
community; the jury can act as the final bulwark against oppressive laws or
their enforcement; it provides a means whereby the public increases its
knowledge of the criminal justice system and it increases, through the
involvement of the public, societal trust in the system as a whole.

 

                   These rationales or
functions of the jury continue to inform the development of the jury and our
interpretation of legislation governing the selection of individual jurors. 
The modern jury was not meant to be a tool in the hands of either the Crown or
the accused and indoctrinated as such through the challenge procedure, but
rather was envisioned as a representative cross-section of society, honestly
and fairly chosen.  Any other vision may run counter to the very rationales
underlying the existence of such a body.  As Moore, supra, comments, it is only recently that
any real representation of society by juries has been achieved in most Western
nations.  He describes the American experience in these words at p. 231:

 

In
1791, a party to a civil or a criminal case was entitled to a 12 member, male,
white, unanimous jury.

 

                   Increasingly,
however, many countries have since repealed property, sex and race
qualifications for jurors and have legislated other expansions in the number of
citizens eligible for jury duty.  (For the English legislative experience see
the Morris Committee, Report of the Departmental Committee on Jury Service,
Command Paper No. 2627; see also Blake, ""The Case for the Jury"", in
Findlay and Duff, eds., The Jury Under Attack, at p. 142.)  These later developments only
serve to underscore the previously articulated rationales for the existence of
the jury.

 

                   The importance of
the jury in our system of criminal justice past and present is eloquently
described by Blackstone in his Commentaries, Book 4, at p. 1735:

 

So
that the liberties of England cannot but subsist so long as this palladium
remains sacred and inviolate; not only from all open attacks, (which none will
be so hardy as to make,) but also from all secret machinations which may sap
and undermine it; by introducing new and arbitrary methods of trial, . . . And,
however convenient these may appear at first, (as doubtless all
arbitrary powers, well executed, are the most convenient,) yet let it be
again remembered that delays and little inconveniences in the forms of justice
are the price that all free nations must pay for their liberty in more
substantial matters; that these inroads upon this sacred bulwark of the nation
are fundamentally opposite to the spirit of our constitution; . . . [Footnotes
omitted.]

 

                   Section 11 (f) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  enshrines the right to trial by jury with these words:

 

                   11. 
Any person charged
with an offence has the right 

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(f) except in the case of an offence
under military law tried before a military tribunal, to the benefit of trial by
jury where the maximum punishment for the offence is imprisonment for five
years or a more severe punishment; 

 

                   The perceived
importance of the jury and the Charter  right to jury trial is meaningless
without some guarantee that it will perform its duties impartially and
represent, as far as is possible and appropriate in the circumstances, the
larger community.  Indeed, without the two characteristics of impartiality and
representativeness, a jury would be unable to perform properly many of the
functions that make its existence desirable in the first place.  Provincial
legislation guarantees representativeness, at least in the initial array.  The
random selection process, coupled with the sources from which this selection is
made, ensures the representativeness of Canadian criminal juries.  (See the
provincial Jury Acts.)  Thus, little if any objection can be made regarding
this crucial characteristic of juries.  Schulman and Myers,
supra, make this
clear at p. 408 of their discussion:

 

                   Jury
qualification requirements in Canadian provinces are considerably different
than those in the United States or England.  The American Bar Association
standards for trial by jury, as recommended by the Advisory Committee on the
Criminal Trial, say that -- ""The names of those persons who may be called
for jury service should be selected at random from sources which will furnish a
representative cross-section of the community.""  Canadian laws by and
large have long met the standard.  [Footnotes omitted, emphasis added.]

 

                   However, the
""in-court"" selection procedure, set out in the
Criminal Code , can
impact on the representativeness of the jury in some situations.  The
impartiality of the jury is controlled in the main through the
Criminal Code 
procedure.  Section 11 (d)
of the Charter  further buttresses the requirement of impartiality:

 

                   11. 
Any person charged
with an offence has the right 

 

                                                                   .
. . 

 

(d) to be presumed innocent until proven
guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and
impartial tribunal;

 

                   In order, then, to
be meaningful, the application of the Criminal Code  provisions must be informed by these
larger expressions of principle.

 

                   Prior to applying
these principles to the case before us, it is necessary to discuss previous
Canadian case law.  In so doing, owing to the nature of a partiality allegation,
the facts of each case will be significant.

 

Canadian
Case Law

 

                    The pivotal and
most recent decisions in this area are R. v. Hubbert, supra, R. v. Guérin and Pimparé, supra,
and R. v. Barrow, supra.  I will, therefore, focus on these cases and
discuss them at length, given, in particular, the confusion which may exist in
their interpretation, as evidenced by the dissent in the Court of Appeal in the
present case.

 

                   In Hubbert, supra,
counsel for the accused wished to challenge each juror for cause alleging that
the prospective jurors were not ""indifferent"".  Counsel wanted to ask
each prospective juror whether the knowledge that the accused had previously
been incarcerated at a hospital for the ""criminally insane"" would
prejudice them towards the accused.  In order to explain some of his conduct,
the accused needed to make his prior incarceration known during testimony at
trial.  The trial judge rejected the application for reasons not relevant to
our discussion here.  Rather, it is the procedure and principles set out by the
Court of Appeal that are pertinent, as they form the basis for much of what has
been said subsequently by Canadian courts.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
begins by setting out a number of principles governing trial by jury and
factors that need to be balanced when considering challenges for cause.  First,
every accused person is entitled to an impartial jury.  Secondly, a juror must
be presumed to perform his/her duties in accordance with the oath sworn. 
Finally, the trial judge has a ""wide discretion"" and must be in a
position to control the challenge procedure.

 

                   In the exercise of
such discretion as regards challenges for cause based on pre-trial publicity,
the Court states that, except in extreme cases, mere dissemination by the media
of the facts of the case is not normally sufficient to ground a challenge for
cause.

 

                   As far as procedure
is concerned, the Court of Appeal discusses a trial judge's ability to
""pre-screen"" prospective jurors for ""obvious partiality"". 
Importantly, it limits this threshold procedure to cases involving
noncontroversial situations of partiality.  Regarding the proper form of a
challenge for cause, the Court holds that counsel must communicate a reason to
the trial judge outside of the mere words of s. 567(1) (b) (now s. 638(1)(b)).  Without this, it would not be
possible for the trial judge to direct the trial of the truth of the
challenge.  If the reason offered appears ""far-fetched"", the trial
judge can require further elaboration.  If the trial judge is satisfied that
there is some ""foundation"" to the challenge, then the trial of the
truth proceeds.  The questioning of the prospective juror must be relevant. 
This is another reason why the trial judge must be given an adequate
explanation for the challenge outside of the mere words of the section. 
Questioning in this phase should not become a ""fishing expedition"".

 

                   Based upon its
comprehensive discussion, the Court of Appeal dismissed the accused's appeal,
holding that what counsel was attempting to do in that case came closer to
securing a favourable jury than an impartial one.  Further, prospective jurors'
reactions to various pieces of evidence that may be elicited at trial are not
the proper subject of the challenge for cause procedure.  Impartiality is a
state of mind to be tested at the time of the swearing in of each juror.

 

                   In dismissing the
accused's appeal and affirming the reasons of the Court of Appeal, this Court
simply stated at p. 267 that:

 

We
agree with the Court of Appeal that the way in which and the grounds on which
the trial judge exercised his discretion in respect of the attempt of counsel
for the accused to challenge for cause is not open to objection. . . . 

 

                   We
would add that in our opinion the procedure outlined by the Court of Appeal for
dealing with challenges for cause provides a useful guide for trial
judges called on to deal with such challenges.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   This Court's
subsequent decision in Barrow, supra, concerned the examination
by the trial judge of the jury panel in the absence of the accused and his
counsel.  The accused argued that this conduct vitiated the subsequent trial. 
While the issue is not on all fours with the one facing the Court here, there
occurs within the majority reasons of Dickson C.J. an important discussion of Hubbert,
supra, and the challenge for cause procedure.

 

                   In Barrow, supra,
the Crown relied on the reasons of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Hubbert,
supra, as justification for the conduct of the trial judge.  Dickson
C.J., writing for the majority, rejected this argument on two grounds.  First,
the pre-screening procedure set out in Hubbert, supra, is done in
the presence of the accused.  Second, and more importantly for our purposes, at
pp. 709-10:

 

. .
. an initial question by the judge to the jury array is best seen as a summary
procedure to speed up the jury selection, done with the consent of the
parties.  This was the view of the majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal in
Guérin v. R.
[citation omitted].  Both Bisson J.A. (at p. 246) and Jacques J.A. (at
pp. 248-49) make the point that when counsel agree to initial questions by
the judge there is no violation of the Code procedure.

 

                   Within his
discussion of the Nova Scotia Juries Act, S.N.S. 1969, c. 12, applicable in
that case, and the respective competence of the provinces and Parliament to
legislate in this area, Dickson C.J. makes a number of strong statements
regarding challenges for cause on the ground of ""non-indifference"".  At
p. 714 he states that the trier of partiality is not the judge but two
potential or previously selected jurors.  Further:

 

Any
addition to this process from another source would upset the balance of the
carefully defined jury selection process.  This is especially the case of any
attempt to add to the powers of the judge. . . . The judge's role is to
supervise trials of partiality, not to decide them.

 

                   According to the
majority, error of this kind in the selection process is so severe that the
only remedy is a new trial.

 

                   The Ontario Court
of Appeal had a recent notable occasion, subsequent to Hubbert, supra,
to consider the proper use of the challenge for cause procedure, namely in R.
v. Zundel (No. 1) (1987), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (leave to appeal to this
Court refused [1987] 1 S.C.R. xii).  The facts of this case being so notorious,
I will not summarize them here.  Suffice it to say that counsel for the accused
wished to challenge each prospective juror for cause based upon the massive
pre-trial publicity.  Instead of allowing the challenge for cause to proceed
the trial judge asked the jury array, among other things, whether they had
formed a preliminary opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused and
asked them to disqualify themselves on this basis.  

 

                   The Court of Appeal
held that the real question, in a case involving pre-trial publicity, was
whether it ""could potentially have the effect of destroying the
prospective juror's indifference between the Crown and the accused.""  The
Court noted that much of the trial judge's reluctance to allow the questioning
of jurors stemmed from the fact that the questions, in large measure, went to
the religious and political beliefs of the jurors.  However, instead of
rejecting the challenge, the trial judge, according to the Court, should have
required counsel for the accused to reword the questions.   The Court of Appeal
concluded in this fashion, at pp. 134-35:

 

                   There
is a denial of a fundamental right to a fair and proper trial where the accused
is not allowed to challenge any number of jurors for cause, when the grounds of
challenge are properly specified. . . . [C]ounsel was entitled to determine
whether any potential juror was, by reason of the pretrial publicity and the
notoriety of the appellant, sufficiently impartial. . . . 

 

A
trial judge cannot, in the exercise of a discretion which he undoubtedly
possesses in the area of admitting grounds of challenge for cause and settling
the questions, effectively curtail the statutory right to challenge for cause. 

 

                   The
warning later given by the trial judge, requesting that individual members of
the panel disqualify themselves under certain circumstances, was insufficient
to correct the erroneous denial of the statutory right of challenge for cause. 
The issue of impartiality or indifference is one that Parliament has entrusted
to the two triers, not to the conscience of the individual prospective juror.

 

                   The last case I
will discuss at any length is that of Guérin and
Pimparé,
supra, a case that
received favourable mention by this Court in Barrow, supra.  The
two accused in the case had allegedly committed a double murder that was the
subject of massive media speculation and community outrage.  Bisson J.A., now
Chief Justice, noted that ""this tragedy horrified the Montreal community,
and that, in large measure, the events, which were widely publicized by the
media, were . . . still fresh in the minds of a good number of the
citizens"" (at p. 241).  The trial judge refused the application of counsel
to challenge each prospective juror for cause on the basis of the pre-trial
publicity.  Instead, the trial judge, in essence, took over the procedure and
asked each juror questions suggested by counsel.  The trial judge then decided
whether the individual juror was or was not impartial.

 

                   All three members
of the Court of Appeal delivered reasons.  In discussing the Hubbert, supra,
pre-screening procedure, Bisson J.A. commented that such a procedure cannot
entail the judicial takeover of a process granted to two triers under the
Criminal Code . 
Further, the words used in Hubbert, supra, regarding
pre-screening by the trial judge, indicate that such a procedure is only
appropriate for ""obvious"" cases of partiality.  This power in the
trial judge does not extend his/her ability to decide questions of partiality. 
If the challenge for cause is baseless, the trial judge can reject it.  Bisson
J.A. further stated, at p. 246:

 

                   Certainly,
the practice whereby the judge may ask the prospective juror several
preliminary questions is commendable. However, it must not systematically
remove all possibility of challenge for cause.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   He allowed the
appeal on the basis that there was a ""fundamental defect in the
constitution of the tribunal which must judge the crimes charged. ... ""

 

                   Jacques J.A. agreed
with Bisson J.A. but added some of his own thoughts regarding the
""Hubbert"" pre-screening procedure.  He made the point that this
procedure arose to meet obvious cases of partiality and thus must be viewed as
being based upon the ""tacit consent"" of both parties.

 

                   Rothman J.A., in
short concurring reasons, also held that the trial judge had erred by screening
the jurors himself and by apparently denying any further challenge on the basis
of the massive pre-trial publicity.

 

                   In rationalizing
these various judicial expressions, it is necessary to reflect on what was in
fact said by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Hubbert, supra. 
While certain broad statements in that case may warrant comment, the Court's
discussion of the pre-screening procedure and the proper course for a trial
judge to follow in an application for a challenge for cause due to alleged
partiality, in the main, cannot be challenged.  Generally, the Court correctly
states the law as it is understood in this country when dealing with an
application for a challenge for cause based upon partiality.  Certain comments
may, however, be appropriate in light of the coming into force of the
Charter .  While it is
no doubt true that trial judges have a wide discretion in these matters and
that jurors will usually behave in accordance with their oaths, these two
principles cannot supercede the right of every accused person to a fair trial,
which necessarily includes the empanelling of an impartial jury. (See The Law
Reform Commission of Canada, The Jury in Criminal Trials, Working Paper 27, 1980.)

 

                   This, however, does
not mean that an accused has the right to a favourable jury nor that the
selection procedure can be used to thwart the representativeness that is
essential to the proper functioning of a jury.  While it may be, in some
instances, that the peremptory challenges allocated to the accused and the
Crown, and the Crown's additional right to stand aside, will be used by the
parties to alter somewhat the degree to which the jury represents the
community, peremptory challenges are justified on a number of grounds.  The
accused may, for example, not have sufficient information to challenge for
cause a member of the panel he/she feels should be excluded.  Peremptory
challenges can also, in certain circumstances, produce a more representative
jury depending upon both the nature of the community and the accused. 
Challenges of this nature also serve to heighten an accused's perception that
he/she has had the benefit of a fairly selected tribunal.  

 

                   As to challenges
for cause, they are properly used to rid the jury of prospective members who
are not indifferent or who otherwise fall within s. 567  (now s. 638), of
the Code, but they stray into illegitimacy if used merely, without more, to
over- or under-represent a certain class in society or as a ""fishing
expedition"" in order to obtain personal information about the juror.  As
previously mentioned, information obtained on an ultimately unsuccessful
challenge for cause may, however, lead the challenger to exercise the right to
challenge peremptorily or to stand aside the particular juror.  If the
challenge process is used in a principled fashion, according to its underlying
rationales, possible inconvenience to potential jurors or the possibility of
slightly lengthening trials is not too great a price for society to pay in
ensuring that accused persons in this country have, and appear to have, a fair
trial before an impartial tribunal, in this case, the jury.

 

                   This being said,
some words of caution are in order as to the nature of the pre-screening that
can be legitimately engaged in by trial judges.  If one harkens back to the
actual words used by the Court of Appeal in Hubbert, supra, it
becomes clear, in my opinion, that the procedure envisioned is inoffensive and
falls outside of the warnings delivered in Barrow, supra, and Guérin
and Pimparé, supra, as evidenced by the following, at pp. 292-93:

 

                   Turning
to the practical consideration of the methods by which the process should be
carried out, we deal first with the kind of obvious partiality dealt
with in the English practice direction.  Some trial Judges make a practice of
saying to the jury panel, before the selection process begins, something of
this nature:

 

If
there is anyone on this panel who is closely connected with a party to this
case or with a witness who is to testify, will you please stand?

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

To
take obvious examples, if the juror is the uncle of the accused, or the wife of
a witness, or the brother of the investigating police officer, he ought not to
serve.

 

                   In
our view, the trial Judge on his own should excuse that prospective juror from
the case, without more ado. . . . We think the practice of excusing jurors
of obvious partiality is a desirable one in all cases.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   I agree.  And, as
pointed out by the Ontario Court of Appeal, if the trial judge does not excuse
a juror at this stage, that juror is still subject to challenge or to a direction
to stand aside.  Nothing said by the Court of Appeal relates to cases of
disputed partiality.  The initial procedure outlined by the Court of Appeal
goes only to such clear-cut cases of partiality that, as said in Guérin and
Pimparé, supra, and Barrow, supra, the consent of
counsel is and can be presumed.  Once out of obvious situations of
non-indifference, as in Guérin and Pimparé, supra, and Barrow,
supra, the procedure takes on a different colour: consent can no longer
be presumed and the procedure must conform to that which is set out in the
Criminal Code .  There
is absolutely no room for a trial judge to increase further his/her powers and
take over the challenge process by deciding controversial questions of
partiality.  If there exist legitimate grounds for a challenge for cause,
outside of the obvious cases addressed by the Hubbert, supra,
procedure, it must proceed in accordance with the Code provisions --the threshold
pre-screening mechanism is a poor, and more importantly, an illegal substitute
in disputed areas of partiality.  (See Vidmar and Melnitzer, ""Juror
Prejudice: An Empirical Study of a Challenge for Cause"" (1984), 22
Osgoode Hall L.J.
487.)  After this initial, narrowly drawn procedure is complete, the process as
set out in the Criminal Code  must be adhered to.  I will refer again to the
clear words of Dickson C.J. in Barrow, supra, at p. 714, which,
though addressing a somewhat different question, are apposite here:

 

                   The Code sets out a detailed process for the
selection of an impartial jury.  It gives both parties substantial powers in
the process and sets up a mechanism to try the partiality of a potential juror
when challenged for cause.  The trier of partiality is not the judge but a
mini-jury of two potential or previously selected jurors. . . . Parliament has
decided that the issue of partiality is a question of fact that must be decided
by two of the jurors themselves, not by the judge. . . . [A]ny judge who
attempts to participate in such decisions usurps the function of the jurors. .
. . 

 

                   Perhaps more
pertinent to the issue here is the question of what degree of pre-trial
publicity or, more generally, non-indifference, is necessary to lead to the
right to challenge for cause and thus have the trial of the issue proceed before
the ""mini-jury"".  The example of pre-trial publicity arises on the
facts of this case and the existence of publicity prior to trial would appear
to be the most frequent cause for a challenge based upon non-indifference.

 

                   A number of factors
need to be addressed in answering this question.  To begin with, s. 567  (now s.
638) of the Criminal Code  places little, if any, burden on the
challenger.  On the other hand, a reasonable degree of control must be retained
by the trial judge and, thus, some burden placed upon the challenger to ensure
that the selection of the jury occurs in a manner that is in accordance with
the principles I have previously articulated and also to ensure that sufficient
information is imparted to the trial judge such that the trial of the truth of
the challenge is contained within permissible bounds.  Thus, while there must
be an ""air of reality"" to the application, it need not be an
""extreme"" case, as were, for example, the cases of Zundel, supra,
and Guérin and Pimparé, supra.  The Ontario Court of Appeal in Zundel,
supra, provided a useful guide in this regard, at p. 132:

 

The
real question is whether the particular publicity and notoriety of the accused
could potentially have the effect of destroying the prospective juror's
indifference between the Crown and the accused.

 

                   Postulating rigid
guidelines is obviously an impossible task.  Lawton J. in R.
v. Kray (1969), 53
Cr. App. R. 412, draws a valuable distinction, in pre-trial publicity cases,
between mere publication of the facts of a case and situations where the media
misrepresents the evidence, dredges up and widely publicizes discreditable incidents
from an accused's past or engages in speculation as to the accused's guilt or
innocence.  It may well be that the pre-trial publicity or other ground of
alleged partiality will, in itself, provide sufficient reasons for a challenge
for cause.  The threshold question is not whether the ground of alleged
partiality will create such partiality in a juror, but rather whether it could
create that partiality which would prevent a juror from being indifferent as to
the result.  In the end, there must exist a realistic potential for the
existence of partiality, on a ground sufficiently articulated in the
application, before the challenger should be allowed to proceed.

 

Application
to the Facts of the Case

 

                   Applying these
principles to the facts of this case, given the whole of the circumstances, the
procedure followed by the trial judge was correct.  It is unfortunate, however,
in my view, that the trial judge used the word ""extraordinary"" to
describe the challenge for cause procedure.  As I have hopefully made clear
throughout these reasons, the right to challenge for cause is an important one
designed to ensure a fair trial.  It is of great assistance in the selection of
a jury that can properly fulfill those duties accorded it.  Further, the
ability to challenge for cause rests upon a showing by the challenger of a
realistic potential for partiality.  The process is neither
""extraordinary"" nor ""exceptional"". 

 

                   Notwithstanding his
seeming misapprehension of the nature of the process, the trial judge was
correct, in my view, in deciding that there was nothing before him in the
present instance that satisfied the requirement set out above.  The pre-trial
publicity did not satisfy the query, ""whether the particular publicity and
notoriety of the accused could potentially have the effect of destroying the
prospective juror's indifference.""  Based on the information given to the
judge, there was no realistic potential for the existence of partiality on the
basis of pre-trial publicity.  The trial occurred a substantial period of time
after the publicity in question and, more importantly, it appears that the
media reports were concerned more with the search and subsequent discovery of
the remains of the victim and the victim's reputation than with the accused or
subsequent proceedings against him.  As Huband J.A. said at p. 149, the
pre-trial publicity here ""was not of the type to occasion partiality
towards an accused"".  In addition, Jewers J. did not close off the
challenge procedure at this point but rather invited continued challenges based
on more appropriate information.  Such information was not forthcoming despite
the representation by accused's counsel that he had material to substantiate
his allegations.

 

                   Having so
concluded, I am nonetheless of the view that the majority of the Court of
Appeal interpreted Hubbert, supra, too broadly.  I refer
particularly to the comments of Huband J.A., at p. 150, regarding the pre-screening
of prospective jurors for partiality undertaken by the trial judge.  This
initial process, in my view, only applies, as is evidenced by the words used in
Hubbert, supra, to consensual, uncontested matters of partiality
and not where the challenge for cause is grounded on some pertinent allegation
as in Barrow, supra, and Guérin and Pimparé, supra.

 

Disposition

 

                   As the challenge
for cause on the basis of the pre-trial publicity was groundless in this case,
I agree in the result with the majority of the Court of Appeal and I would
therefore dismiss the appeal.

 

//Stevenson
J.//

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by 

 

                   Stevenson
J. -- I have had the
advantage of reading the opinion of my colleague Justice L'Heureux-Dubé and
agree with her disposition of the appeal and her reasons for disposing of the
point raised in the dissent which gave rise to the appeal.

 

                   I prefer, however,
to restrict my concurrence to that point lest I be  thought to be passing upon
the discussion of the collateral questions, notably that of the
""representative"" nature of the jury.

 

                   The issue in the
appeal is the propriety of the response of the trial judge to a request by the
defence counsel that he be permitted to put some 11 questions to each juror by
way of a challenge for cause.  The dissenting judge, (1989), 58 Man. R. (2d)
145, described the main ground of appeal at p. 151, as being ""that the
trial judge usurped the function of triers of facts in dealing with challenges
for cause.""  In the course of his reasons he cast some doubt upon the
authority of R. v. Hubbert (1975), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 279.

 

                   I pause to note
that, had the trial judge purported to decide the question of whether a
challenge was proven as distinct from the question of whether it might be made,
""usurpation"" would be a proper characterization.

 

                   Hubbert, has been frequently cited and
applied, and, in my view, its authority remains undiminished.  Two propositions
may be drawn from it.  Firstly, some concerns about partiality may be addressed
by procedures short of a challenge for cause.  The trial judge's putting
general questions to the panel is one example.  Secondly, where counsel seeks
to invoke the right to challenge each juror the trial judge is to be satisfied
there is some foundation to the challenge.

 

                   This appeal
involves the second proposition and I agree with  L'Heureux-Dubé J. that in
this case the challenge for cause on the basis of pre-trial publicity was
groundless.  I add that defence counsel at trial expressed the view that the
questioning ""would give me some rational basis for exercising the
peremptory challenge"".  The latter is not a permissible ground for
challenging for cause.

 

                   I would, therefore,
dismiss the appeal.

                   Sullivan
and Lemay, midwives with some experience in home births but with no formal
medical training, were charged under ss. 203 and 204 (now ss. 220 and
221) of the Criminal Code , after a child
they were attempting to deliver died while still in the birth canal.  At trial,
they were convicted of criminal negligence causing death of the child
(s. 203 ) (count 1) but were acquitted of criminal negligence causing
bodily harm to the mother (s. 204 ) (count 2).  Sullivan and Lemay appealed
their conviction on count 1; the Crown did not appeal their acquittal on count
2.  The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the conviction but substituted
a conviction on the count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm, notwithstanding
the absence of a crown appeal.  Sullivan and Lemay appealed the substituted
conviction to this Court, and the Crown appealed the decision of the Court of
Appeal to overturn the initial conviction on count 1.

 

                   At
issue, in R. v. Sullivan and Lemay, was whether a
living child partially born is a person within the meaning of s. 203  of
the Criminal Code , and if so,
whether an appropriate standard for determining liability is an objective
standard.  At issue in Sullivan and Lemay v. The Queen was
whether s. 613(2)  and (8)  gave the Court of Appeal jurisdiction to
substitute a conviction of criminal negligence causing bodily harm in the
absence of a Crown appeal on that count and whether the Court of Appeal erred
in holding the foetus to be a part of the mother, such that a conviction for
criminal negligence causing bodily harm could obtain on the death of the
foetus. 

 

                   Held in
Sullivan and Lemay v. The Queen (L'Heureux‑Dubé J.
dissenting):  The appeal from the Court of Appeal's judgment substituting a
conviction of criminal negligence causing bodily harm should be allowed.

 

                   Held in R.
v. Sullivan and Lemay:  The appeal from the Court of Appeal's judgment
acquitting Sullivan and Lemay of criminal negligence causing death should be
dismissed.

 

                   Per Lamer
C.J. and Wilson, La Forest, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin and Stevenson
JJ.:  From the wording of s. 206, a foetus is not a ""human
being"" for the purposes of the Code.  The introduction
of the criminal negligence provisions in 1954 was not intended to change the
meaning of ""person"" and that term, as used in s. 203 of the Code, is
synonymous with the term ""human being"".

 

                   A
court of appeal has no jurisdiction to disturb a verdict of acquittal unless
there has been an appeal by the Crown from that acquittal.  An exception
occurs, however, where the Kienapple rule is applicable.  The
Kienapple rule has no application here.  First, there is an
insufficient legal nexus between the two offences; count 1 requires proof of
the death of the foetus while count 2 requires proof of bodily harm to the
mother.  The two charges, while they may involve the same general conduct,
involve two separate consequences.  Second, the acquittal entered by the trial
judge on the charge of criminal negligence causing bodily harm was an acquittal
on the merits and was not entered pursuant to a finding of guilt on the
first count.  Sullivan and Lemay could have been convicted on both counts. 
Even if no independent bodily harm was found to have occurred, it would still
not be impossible for Sullivan and Lemay to have been convicted on both
counts.  The Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction under s. 613 to
substitute a conviction of criminal negligence causing bodily harm.

 

                   No
compelling policy reasons were put forward for granting a further exception
which would extend the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to substitute a
conviction for an acquittal in the absence of a Crown appeal.

 

                   Per
L'Heureux‑Dubé J. (dissenting in Sullivan and
Lemay v. The Queen):  The Crown's appeal from the acquittal entered by the
Court of Appeal should be dismissed as proposed by Lamer C.J.  The appeal by
Sullivan and Lemay should also be dismissed since the Court of Appeal had
jurisdiction to enter a conviction pursuant to s. 613(8)  of the
Criminal Code .  The trial judge specifically considered the question
of guilt on the second count of causing bodily harm by criminal negligence. 
She would have convicted if she had not concluded that the child was not part
of the mother.

                   The
judgment of Lamer C.J. and Wilson, La Forest, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory,
McLachlin and Stevenson JJ. was delivered by

 

                   Lamer C.J. -- This case
involves two midwives who were charged under ss. 203  and 204  (now ss. 220 and
221) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34 , after a baby they were attempting to deliver died while still in the
birth canal.  At trial, they were convicted of criminal negligence causing
death to the baby (s. 203 ) but were acquitted of criminal negligence causing
bodily harm to the mother (s. 204).  The Court of Appeal overturned the
conviction under s. 203  and substituted a conviction under s. 204 (criminal
negligence causing bodily harm).

 

                   This
case raises the issue of whether a foetus in the birth canal is a
""person"" for the purposes of s. 203 .  It also raises a procedural
question regarding the jurisdiction of a court of appeal under s. 613 (now s.
686) of the Code.   The case initially raised other
important issues regarding the legal status of a foetus and the mens
rea required for criminal negligence but, due to the lack of appeal by the
Crown, these issues need not all be addressed because of the procedural
determination. 

 

The
Facts

 

                   Sullivan
and Lemay were hired by Jewel Voth to provide private pre-natal classes and to
act as midwives during a home birth.  Although Sullivan and Lemay had some
experience with home births and had done background reading, they had no formal
medical qualifications.

 

                   After
five hours of second stage labour, the child's head emerged and no further
contractions occurred.  Sullivan and Lemay attempted to stimulate further
contractions but were unsuccessful.  Direct pressure was applied to the uterus,
causing soreness to the mother's stomach and back and some bruising. 
Approximately twenty minutes later, Emergency Services were called and the
mother was transported to the hospital.  Within two minutes of arrival, an
intern delivered the baby using what the trial judge characterized as ""a
basic delivery technique"".  The child showed no signs of life and
resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful.

 

                   Sullivan
and Lemay were jointly charged with one count of criminal negligence causing
death to the child of Jewel Voth contrary to s. 203  of the
Criminal Code , and a second count of criminal negligence causing
bodily harm to Jewel Voth contrary to s. 204 .  They were tried in the County
Court of Vancouver and were found guilty on the first charge and were acquitted
on the second charge.

 

                   Sullivan
and Lemay appealed the criminal negligence causing death conviction on count 1
to the British Columbia Court of Appeal.  The Crown did not appeal the
acquittal of Sullivan and Lemay on count 2.  The Court of Appeal allowed the
appeal from the conviction on the first count, but substituted a conviction on
the count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm (notwithstanding the
absence of a crown appeal).  Sullivan and Lemay have appealed the substituted
conviction on the second count to this Court, and the Crown has appealed the
decision of the Court of Appeal to overturn the initial conviction on the first
count.

 

                   Both
the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (L.E.A.F.) and R.E.A.L. Women of
Canada have intervened in this case.

Judgments
Below

 

County
Court of Vancouver (Godfrey L.J.S.C.) (1986), 31 C.C.C.
(3d) 62

 

                   The
trial judge first dealt with s. 198 of the Code (now s.
216) and held that the acts of a childbirth attendant are included in the
phrase ""any other lawful act that may endanger the life of another
person"" and that the accused were therefore under ""a legal duty to
have and to use reasonable knowledge, skill and care in so doing"".  The
Judge held that the applicable standard was that of a ""competent
childbirth attendant"".  In assessing whether Sullivan and Lemay failed to
have and to use such reasonable skill and knowledge, Godfrey L.J.S.C. noted, at
p. 68, that she was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that:

 

First, had this child and mother been transported to
hospital even as late as one o'clock, the child would have lived; secondly, had
the accused possessed the skills of the intern at St. Paul's Hospital, the
child would have lived. 

 

Godfrey
L.J.S.C. held that Sullivan's and Lemay's lack of knowledge, skill and care was
in breach of the legal duty imposed by s. 198 and that this lack of knowledge
and skill had caused the death of the child of Jewel Voth.  The Judge then
turned to the issue of whether Sullivan and Lemay had shown wanton or reckless
disregard for the lives or safety of other persons within the meaning of s. 202
(now s. 219).  She concluded that the mens rea of
criminal negligence is determined by an objective standard and thus that
""good intentions"" on the part of the midwives were irrelevant. 
Consequently, Godfrey L.J.S.C. held that the actions and omissions of the
appellants, in all the circumstances, showed a reckless disregard for the life
and safety of the child.

 

                   Before
finding the appellants guilty of criminal negligence causing death to the
child, the Judge briefly considered whether the foetus is a person for the
purposes of s. 203 .  She considered and adopted the reasoning of the County
Court of Vancouver Island in R. v. Marsh (1979), 31 C.R.
(3d) 363, to the effect that a full-term child in the process of being born is
a person within the meaning of s. 203 , notwithstanding that it would not be a
human being for the purpose of s. 206 (now s. 223).

 

                   With
respect to the second count, Godfrey L.J.S.C. held that the bruising, etc., did
not amount to bodily harm and therefore found the accused not guilty of
criminal negligence causing bodily harm to the child of Jewel Voth.  She also
commented that had the baby been ""part"" of the mother, she would have
found the appellants guilty on that count.

 

British
Columbia Court of Appeal (Per Curiam) (1988), 31
B.C.L.R. (2d) 145

 

                   The
court first dealt with the issue of whether the child was a person within the
meaning of s. 203 .  After reviewing the law on this point in England, the
United States, and Canada, the court stated that, at common law, the line of
demarcation for a foetus to become a person was the requirement that it be
completely extruded from its mother's body and be born alive.  The court noted
that the Code reflected this position in s. 206 in
defining when a child becomes a human being.  It stated that Parliament drew no
distinction between a person and a human being prior to 1953 and that when
Parliament legislated with respect to criminal negligence in 1953, it did not
intend to insert such a distinction into the Code. 
Accordingly, the child was not a person within the meaning of s. 203  and
Sullivan and Lemay could not be found guilty of criminal negligence causing
death (to another person).  The court noted, at p. 160, that 

 

If Parliament considers it appropriate to protect a
child during the birth process from criminally negligent acts by those
attending and assisting at the birth, that is a matter upon which Parliament
can legislate.

 

                   Having
reached this conclusion on the first count, the court did not find it necessary
to consider the other grounds of appeal; thus the Court did not consider
whether the trial judge was in error in finding mens rea based
solely on an objective standard.

 

                   The
Court of Appeal then considered the second count of criminal negligence causing
bodily harm to Jewel Voth.  It noted that the trial judge had indicated that
she would have found the accused guilty on the second count in the event that
she had reached the conclusion that the foetus was not a person, because she
would then have found that the foetus was a part of its mother at the time of
its death.   The court indicated that its holding on the line of demarcation
between a foetus and a person led it to the conclusion that a child in the birth
canal is, as a matter of law, part of the mother.  Thus, Sullivan and Lemay
could be convicted of criminal negligence causing bodily harm to Jewel Voth via
the harm done to the foetus.  The court appeared to accept the Crown's
submission that it had jurisdiction to allow the appeal pursuant to s. 613(2)
(now 686(2)) and to thereby enter an acquittal on count 1, and also to enter a
conviction on count 2 pursuant to s. 613(8)  (now 686(8)).  Referring to the
reasons of Dickson C.J. in Terlecki v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
483, the court indicated that the normal procedure would be to remit the matter
to the trial judge to consider whether to register a conviction on the second
count.  However, Godfrey L.J.S.C. had expressed her opinion on this point and it
was therefore unnecessary to do so.  Therefore, the court entered a conviction
on the second count.

 

Issues

 

Count
1 (R. v. Sullivan and Lemay)

 

1.  Did the Court of Appeal err in concluding that a
living child, partially born, is not a ""person"" within the meaning of
s. 203  (now s. 220) of the Criminal Code ?

If so,

 

2.  Did the trial judge err in concluding that the
appropriate standard for determining liability for criminal negligence under s.
203  (now s. 220) is an objective standard?

 

Count
2 (Sullivan and Lemay v. The Queen)

 

3.  Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that s.
613(2) (now s. 686(2)) and s. 613(8)  (now s. 686(8)) gave it the authority to
substitute a conviction on count 2 in the absence of a Crown appeal on that
count?

If not,

 

4.  Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that as a
matter of law the foetus is part of the mother, and that therefore the
appellants could be convicted under s. 204 (now s. 221) based on the death of
the foetus?

 

Analysis

 

The
Meaning of ""Person"" in s. 203 

 

                   Sullivan
and Lemay have argued that the Crown's appeal on this issue should be
dismissed, both on the grounds that it has been abandoned and that it cannot be
supported on the merits.  It is true that the Crown has not directly supported
the contention that a foetus is a person within the meaning of s. 203 .  The
Crown has appealed on this ground because it takes the position that a foetus
must either be a part of its mother or a person; there can be no intermediate
state.  Thus, the Crown has appealed on this ground in order to avoid putting
this Court in the position of finding a foetus to be a person under s. 203  and
yet being forced to acquit the appellants because the first count is not before
the Court.  Counsel for the Crown did acknowledge that it had sought leave to
appeal before the decision of this Court in Tremblay v.
Daigle, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 530, and it directed no oral argument
to the proposition that a foetus is a person.

 

                   Sullivan
and Lemay contend that the Crown is only bringing this appeal as a convenience
to the intervener, R.E.A.L. Women, which has argued that the foetus is a person
within s. 203 .  They argue that the Crown has no right to bring an appeal on an
issue which it does not, itself, support.  In my view, it is unfair to say that
the Crown's appeal has been brought solely for the convenience of the
intervener, R.E.A.L. Women.  The Crown has brought the appeal because it takes
the position that if the foetus is not a part of the mother, then it is a
person.  The Crown assumes that if this Court finds, in the main appeal, that
the Court of Appeal erred in finding that a foetus in the birth canal is a part
of the mother, the natural corollary will be that the foetus is a person. 
Whether or not this assumption is valid, the Crown's appeal on count 1 is
consistent with its approach to the issues and it is clear that the Crown has
not brought this appeal to aid the intervener R.E.A.L. Women.  Admittedly 
R.E.A.L.  Women's arguments depend on there being a crown appeal before us.  Thus,
I now turn to the merits of this appeal.

 

                   It
is clear from the wording of s. 206 that a foetus is not a ""human
being"" for the purposes of the Code.  However,
R.E.A.L. Women has argued that ""person"" and ""human being""
are not equivalent terms within the Code.  The argument was
made that ""person"" is broader than ""human being"" because
""person"" includes a foetus, while ""human being"" does not. 
I have not been persuaded by any of the textual arguments put forward to support
this position.

 

                   The
Court of Appeal has, in my view, reviewed and analyzed the law on this point in
a very thorough manner.  The terms ""person"" and ""human
being"" were used interchangeably in the pre-1954 homicide provisions.  The
question then becomes, is there any reason to conclude that the 1953-54
Criminal Code  revision gave new meaning to these terms?  The Court of
Appeal has concluded that the introduction of the criminal negligence
provisions by Parliament in 1954 (via An Act Respecting the Criminal Law,
S.C. 1953-54, c. 51, s. 192) was not intended to change the long
established meaning of the word ""person"".  Indeed, the
House of Commons Debates [p. 2423] indicate that when the criminal negligence
provisions were considered in committee on February 25, 1954, the members did
not address the fact that the sections employed the term ""person"" as
opposed to ""human being"".  Moreover, when the revised homicide
provisions were considered in committee, the members did not address the fact
that these provisions employed the term ""human being"" while the
criminal negligence provisions employed the term ""person"".  In fact,
the revisions were agreed to rather quickly following a short discussion
regarding the concept of criminal negligence.

 

                   Accordingly,
I agree with the Court of Appeal that the introduction of the criminal
negligence provisions by Parliament in 1954 was not intended to change the
meaning of ""person"" and that the term, as used in s. 203 of the Code, is
synonymous with the term ""human being"".  Therefore, according to s. 206,
the child of Jewel Voth was not a ""person"" within the meaning of
s. 203  and Sullivan and Lemay cannot be convicted of criminal negligence
causing death to another person.

 

                   The
intervener L.E.A.F. encouraged this Court to find that a foetus is not a
""person"" within the meaning of s. 203  on the basis that such a result
would be inconsistent with the goal of sexual equality in the law which has
been recognized by this Court in both Charter and
non-Charter cases: Andrews v. Law
Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143; Brooks v.
Canada Safeway Ltd., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1219; R. v. Lavallee, [1990]
1 S.C.R. 852.  Such an approach to statutory interpretation may have arisen if
an examination of the legislative history of the criminal negligence provisions
had revealed that Parliament had intended that the term ""person""
would include a foetus, whereas ""human being"" would not.  However,
this was not the case.  The result reached above is consistent with the
""equality approach"" taken by L.E.A.F.; but it is unnecessary to
consider this point in further detail. 

 

                   I
would therefore dismiss the Crown's appeal from the acquittal entered by the
Court of Appeal on count 1.

 

The
Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under s. 613

 

                   Sullivan
and Lemay have appealed from the substituted conviction on count 2 on the basis
that the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to substitute a conviction on
count 2 in the absence of a Crown appeal.

 

                   This
Court has previously held that a court of appeal has no jurisdiction to disturb
a verdict of acquittal unless there has been an appeal by the Crown from that
acquittal: see Rickard v. The Queen, [1970] S.C.R.
1022; Guillemette v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R.
356.  An exception to this general rule has, however, been established in cases
where the Kienapple rule is applicable:  see
Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.  When the
Kienapple principles are operative, s. 613(8)  provides
supplementary powers to an appeal court such that the acquittal at trial can be
considered in the absence of a Crown appeal.  This is because the
Kienapple rule arises in cases where the principle nemo
debet bis puniri pro uno delicto (a person should not be punished
twice for one offence) is applicable.  In other words, in a
Kienapple situation, there have been two findings of guilt but a
conditional stay is entered on one charge for policy reasons.  As was stated by
Justice Wilson in R. v. Provo, [1989] 2 S.C.R.
3, at p. 16:

 

If the accused's appeal from the conviction arising from
the same delict is eventually dismissed or the accused does not appeal within
the specified times, then the conditional stay becomes a permanent stay and in
accordance with this Court's judgment in R v. Jewitt, [1985]
2 S.C.R. 128, that stay becomes tantamount to a judgment or verdict of
acquittal for the purpose of an appeal or a plea of autrefois
acquit.  If, on the other hand as is the case here, the
accused's appeal from the conviction is successful, the conditional stay
dissolves and the appellate courts, while allowing the appeal, can make an
order remitting to the trial judge the count or counts which were conditionally
stayed by reason of the application of the rule against multiple convictions
notwithstanding that no appeal was taken from the conditionally stayed counts.

 

The
exception to the general rule that a court of appeal has no jurisdiction to
substitute a conviction for an acquittal which has not been appealed by the
Crown, which arises in a Kienapple situation, is justified by the policy
considerations which underlie the Kienapple rule. 
As was stated by Wilson J. in Provo, at p. 17:

 

The accused who would be guilty of an offence except for
the application of the rule against multiple convictions is not, in my view,
deserving of an acquittal in the true sense that the state had not met its
burden of proving the elements of the offence.  ...  The policy considerations
here are analogous to those which apply when proceedings against an accused are
stayed because of entrapment.  They are concerned with the integrity and
fairness of the administration of justice rather than with the culpability of
the accused.

 

Thus,
unless the case at bar falls within the Kienapple
exception or raises similar policy issues which compel a new exception to the
general rule, it is my view that there was no jurisdiction under s. 613 by
which the Court of Appeal could substitute a conviction on count 2.  Outside of
a Kienapple situation, s. 613(8)  confers no jurisdiction on a court
of appeal with respect to a count which has not been appealed from the court
below - the ancillary powers embodied in s. 613(8)  can only be exercised in
relation to a count which is properly before the court.

 

                   In
my opinion, the Kienapple rule has no application to this case.
 First, there is an insufficient legal nexus between the two offences; one
requires proof of the death of the foetus while the other requires proof of
bodily harm to the mother.  While the two charges may involve the same general
conduct, they involve two separate consequences.  Second, the acquittal entered
by the trial judge on count 2 was an acquittal on the merits and was not
entered pursuant to a finding of guilt on the first count.  I respectfully
disagree with the Crown's assertion that Sullivan and Lemay could not have been
convicted on both counts in this case.  The trial judge explicitly considered
whether Jewel Voth had suffered bodily harm (independent of the death of the
foetus) and concluded that she had not.  Had the trial judge made a different
finding of fact, she may well have convicted Sullivan and Lemay on both
counts.  Furthermore, even if no independent bodily harm was found to have
occurred, it would still not be impossible for Sullivan and Lemay to
have been convicted on both counts.  It would not have been illogical to find
that bodily harm was done to Jewel Voth through the death of the foetus which
was inside of and connected to her body and, at the same time, to find that the
foetus was a person who could be the victim of criminal negligence causing
death.

 

                   In
summary, the Kienapple rule does not apply to this case and
no compelling policy reasons have been put before this Court for granting a
further exception which would extend the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to
substitute a conviction for an acquittal in the absence of a Crown appeal.

 

Disposition

 

                   Based
on the reasons given above, I would dismiss the Crown's appeal from the
acquittal entered by the British Columbia Court of Appeal on the first count,
and would allow the appeal by Sullivan and Lemay from the conviction entered by
the Court of Appeal on the second count.

 

//L'Heureux-Dubé
J.//

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

L'H              eureux-Dubé J.
(dissenting in Sullivan and Lemay v. The Queen) -- I have had the
opportunity to read the reasons of the Chief Justice.  While I agree with him
that the Crown's appeal from the acquittal entered by the British Columbia
Court of Appeal must be dismissed, contrary to the Chief Justice I would also
dismiss the appellants' appeal from the conviction entered by the Court of
Appeal on the second count.

 

                   I
agree with the judgment below (1988), 31 B.C.L.R. (2d) 145, that the Court of
Appeal had jurisdiction to enter a conviction pursuant to s. 613(8)  (now s. 686(8))
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, which reads:

 

                   613.  . . .

 

                   (8) Where a court of appeal exercises
any of the powers conferred by subsection (2), (4), (6) or (7), it may make any
order, in addition, that justice requires.

 

                   Referring
to R. v. Terlecki (1983), 42 A.R. 87
(C.A.), aff'd [1985] 2 S.C.R. 483, the Court of Appeal stated at p. 163, per
curiam:

 

Adopting what was said by Dickson C.J.C. in
Terlecki as to the proper disposition of the matter, it would
normally follow that we would return the matter to the trial judge to consider
whether to register a conviction on count 2 and, if so, to impose sentence.  In
this case the trial judge has already considered the matter.  In these
circumstances we would enter a conviction on count 2 . . . .

 

                   The
trial judge specifically considered the question of guilt on the second count,
which was causing bodily harm by criminal negligence. She stated ((1986), 31
C.C.C. (3d) 62), at p. 75:

 

                   I should comment that had I reached
the opposite conclusion with respect to the ""persons"" argument above,
then I would have found the accused guilty on this count because I would have
concluded that the child was a part of Jewel Voth at the time of its death.

 

                   In
these circumstances, I agree with the Court of Appeal's disposition and
therefore I would dismiss the appellants' appeal from their convictions on the
second count.

 

                   In
the result I would dismiss both appeals.

                   The Vancouver
Police were conducting a ""buy‑and‑bust"" operation in an
area ‑‑ the Granville Mall ‑‑ considered to have a drug
trafficking problem.  In a ""buy‑and‑bust"" operation,
undercover police officers attempt to buy illicit drugs from individuals who
appear, in the officers' opinion, to be inclined to sell drugs.  The appellant,
who in the words of a police officer was ""dressed scruffy"", was in
the Granville Mall area when approached on a ""hunch"" by an undercover
police officer.  The officer asked him if he had any ""weed"".  Despite
a negative answer, the officer asked the question again and persisted until the
appellant agreed to sell a small amount of cannabis resin.  Another officer
arrested the appellant shortly afterwards.

 

                   The appellant was
found guilty of trafficking in cannabis resin, of the included offence of
possession of cannabis resin for the purpose of trafficking, and of possession
of marijuana.  The trial judge found, however, that the police officer had
engaged in ""random virtue testing"" and granted a judicial stay for
entrapment.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal of
the finding of entrapment and ordered a new trial.  The issues before this
Court were:  (1) whether appellant was subjected to random virtue‑testing;
and, (2) whether this Court, absent a cross‑appeal by the Crown, has jurisdiction
to modify the court of appeal's decision allowing the Crown's appeal from the
judicial stay of proceedings and enter three convictions.

 

                   Held (L'Heureux‑Dubé J. dissenting
in part, McLachlin J.dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Wilson, La Forest,
Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory and Stevenson JJ.:  The police may only present the
opportunity to commit a particular crime to an individual who arouses a
suspicion that he or she is already engaged in the particular criminal activity. 
An exception to this rule arises when the police undertake a bona fide investigation directed at an area
where it is reasonably suspected that criminal activity is occurring.  When
such a location is defined with sufficient precision, the police may present any
person associated with the area with the opportunity to commit the particular
offence.  The notion of being ""associated"" with a particular area for
these purposes does not require more than being present in the area. 
Such randomness is permissible within the scope of a bona fide inquiry.

 

                   Random virtue‑testing
only arises when a police officer presents a person with the opportunity to
commit an offence without a reasonable suspicion that:  (a) the person
is already engaged in the particular criminal activity, or (b) the physical
location with which the person is associated is a place where the particular
criminal activity is likely occurring.

 

                   The police officer
here did not have a ""reasonable suspicion"" that the appellant was
already engaged in unlawful drug‑related activity.  The factors drawing
her attention to the appellant ‑‑ his manner of dress, the length
of his hair ‑‑ were not sufficient to give rise to a reasonable
suspicion that criminal acts were being committed.  The subjectiveness of her
decision to approach the appellant, based on a ""hunch"" or
""feeling"" rather than extrinsic evidence, also indicated that the
appellant did not arouse a reasonable suspicion as an individual.  The
appellant, however, was presented with the opportunity to sell drugs in the
course of a bona fide inquiry.  The officer's conduct was motivated by the
genuine purpose of investigating and repressing criminal activity and the
investigation was directed at a suitable area within Vancouver.  Although the size
of the area itself may indicate that the investigation is not bona fide, it was reasonable for the Vancouver
Police Department to focus its investigation on the Granville Mall.

 

                   The appellant, when
he was in the Granville Mall, was in a location where it was reasonably
believed that drug‑related crimes were occurring.  The officer's conduct
was therefore justified.

 

                   Section 695(1)  does
not allow this Court to make, in all circumstances, a decision that in its
opinion the Court of Appeal could have and should have made.  This Court has
jurisdiction under s. 695(1)  to modify an order at the request of the Crown
when there is an appeal by the Crown making such a request.  When there is no
appeal by the Crown, an appellant cannot leave this Court with less than what
he gained from the Court of Appeal.

 

                   In the absence of
an appeal by the Crown, this Court has no jurisdiction to allow the Crown's
request that the order below be modified. To hold otherwise would allow the
Crown to appeal to this Court where such an opportunity has not been provided
by the Criminal Code 
or the Supreme Court Act .  The Crown is not given by statute the ability to appeal to this
Court a decision which allowed its appeal from an acquittal or judicial
stay of proceedings, but which gave the Crown less than what had been
requested.  As a result, there is no statutory provision which would allow the
Crown to appeal from the Court of Appeal's judgment. Absent a statutory right
of appeal, there is no right of appeal.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé J. (dissenting
in part):  The appeal on the entrapment issue should be dismissed for the
reasons given by Lamer C.J.

 

                   As a general rule,
an appellate court cannot disturb a verdict of acquittal or modify an order
directing a new trial, absent an appeal by the Crown asking it to do so. 
Appellate jurisdiction is conferred entirely by statute.  The rationales
underlying the general rule, however, become inoperative in certain
situations.  One such situation deals with circumstances where the Kienapple principle is triggered.

 

                   Due to the
operation of the rule against multiple convictions, an exception to the general
rule regarding Crown appeals and appellate jurisdiction has been formulated. 
The general rule has little meaning in a situation where the Kienapple principle applies.  The continued
effect of the ""acquittal"" is lifted and the conviction is reinstated
should the Crown's appeal of the stay, by appealing the application of the rule
itself, be successful or should the accused successfully appeal one of the
convictions.  There is really nothing of substance for the Crown to appeal.

 

                   No ""live""
issue regarding the second branch of the entrapment test existed.  In this
light, it is as unreal to entertain arguments of prejudice to the accused in
entering convictions as it is to order a new trial in such circumstances.  The
lack of adjudication by the trial judge regarding the second branch of the
entrapment test can neither prevent the entering of a conviction nor justify
the order for a new trial on that issue.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeal
erred in ordering a new trial on this second branch of the test of entrapment.

 

                   While not laying
waste to the general rule, the present case offers convincing reasons for
treating it in the same fashion as a situation falling more squarely within the Kienapple exception.  Like the situation in a Kienapple context, the full force of the
general rule obliging the Crown to appeal is avoided in an entrapment situation
because of the nature of the proceedings and the underpinnings of the
""acquittal"" entered in such situations.  The Crown's position, after
an appeal by the accused in an entrapment situation, is closely analogous to
that in a Kienapple context:  there is nothing meaningful for the Crown to appeal.  If the
Crown's appeal is successful and the entrapment arguments of the accused are
unsuccessful on appeal, the stay will be set aside and the convictions will
stand.  As in a Kienapple situation, the ""acquittal"" fails to remain relevant after
the entrapment issue is dispensed with and an accused cannot ignore that
necessary result.  Requiring the Crown to appeal the ""acquittal"" in
order to formalize this necessary consequence is a meaningless formality easily
dispensed with in a Kienapple situation.  The same result should also obtain in an entrapment
situation.

 

                   Per McLachlin J. (dissenting): 
Determination of entrapment must involve a balancing between the individual
interest in being left alone and the state's interest in the repression of
crime.  Only where considerations such as fairness, justice and the need for
protection from crime tip the balance in favour of the state will police
conduct which offends the individual interests at stake be acceptable.

 

                   The significance of
the individual interest at stake here must not be underestimated and the
adverse effect that police investigatory techniques can have on this interest
should not be overlooked.  Limits must be placed on the state's ability to
intrude into the daily lives of its citizens.  A further risk inherent in
overbroad undercover operations is that of discriminatory police work, where
people are interfered with not because of reasonable suspicion but because of
the colour of their skin or the quality of their clothing and their age.

 

                   The test for
entrapment must permit the measuring of relative harms.  In determining whether
there was a bona fide inquiry, the court must consider not only the motive of the police and
whether there is crime in the general area, but also other factors relevant to
the balancing process, such as the likelihood of crime at the particular location
targeted, the seriousness of the crime in question, the number of legitimate
activities and persons who might be affected, and the availability of other
less intrusive investigative techniques.  The question is whether the
interception at the particular location was reasonable having regard to the
conflicting interests of private citizens in being left alone from state
interference and of the state in suppressing crime.  If the answer to this
question is yes, then the inquiry is bona fide.  This test offers sufficient
guidance to the police.

 

                   That crime may be
said to occur generally within a given area does not suffice to establish a bona fide inquiry, given proper police
motives.  Other factors must be considered.  The first is the likelihood of crime
in the particular area targeted.  The fact that trafficking occurred at
different locations in the six‑block area of the mall does not establish
that trafficking was likely to occur at the time and place where the appellant
was intercepted.  The second relates to the possibility that this undercover
operation would interfere with the legitimate activities of law‑abiding
citizens.  This factor, while not in itself conclusive, weighed against the
right of undercover police to intercede at will.  On the other side of the
balance must be weighed the seriousness of the criminal activity which the
police have targeted.  The offence here in question, while not to be condoned,
could not be considered as one of the most serious and alternative
investigatory techniques were available to detect it.

 

                   The individual
interest in being left alone and free to pursue one's daily business without
being confronted by undercover police operatives vastly outweighs the state
interest in the repression of crime.  The police officer here, therefore, was
not acting pursuant to a bona fide inquiry.

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and Wilson, La Forest, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory and Stevenson JJ. was
delivered by

 

                   Lamer C.J. -- This case involves a
consideration of the defence of entrapment as set out by this Court in R. v. Mack, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903.  In particular,
this Court is asked whether the accused was subjected to random virtue-testing
by an undercover police officer in the city of Vancouver.  This case also
raises the question of whether this Court, at the request of the Crown, has
jurisdiction to modify the decision of a court of appeal which has allowed an
appeal by the Crown from a judicial stay of proceedings entered at trial.

 

Facts

 

                   On January 12,
1989, the appellant sold one gram of hashish to an undercover police officer
near the Granville Mall area of Vancouver. The parties do not dispute the facts
surrounding the sale, which are as follows.

 

                   The undercover
officer was involved in a ""buy-and-bust"" operation conducted by the
Vancouver Police Department.  In a buy-and-bust operation, undercover police
officers attempt to buy illicit drugs from individuals who appear, in the
opinion of the officers, to be inclined to sell such drugs.  If an officer is
successful, the individual is immediately arrested for trafficking.

 

                   This particular
operation was undertaken by the Department with respect to the Granville Mall
area in the city of Vancouver, which covers a six-block section of Granville
Street.  On the day of the arrest, the undercover officer approached the
accused, Philip Barnes, and his friend, as they were walking towards Granville
Street.  The officer testified at trial that she approached the accused and his
friend because she had ""a hunch, a feeling that they'd -- possibly might
be in possession"".  She believed that he and his friend fit the
description of persons who possibly had drugs in their possession and who would
be willing to sell to her: ""I had a feeling. They fit my general
criteria.  I look for males hanging around, dressed scruffy and in jeans,
wearing a jean jacket or leather jacket, runners or black boots, that tend to
look at people a lot.""  The officer indicated that there was nothing else
that aroused her suspicions.

 

                   The officer
approached the accused and asked him if he had any ""weed"".  He said
""no"", but his friend repeated to him: ""She wants some
weed.""  The accused again responded negatively.  The officer persisted and
the accused then agreed to sell a small amount of cannabis resin to the officer
for $15.  Shortly afterwards, the accused was arrested by another officer and
small amounts of cannabis resin and marijuana were seized from his person.

 

                   The accused was
tried in the County Court of Vancouver before Leggatt Co. Ct. J., and was found
guilty of trafficking in cannabis resin, of the included offence of possession
of cannabis resin for the purpose of trafficking, and of possession of
marijuana.  The accused conceded that he sold illicit drugs to the officer, but
argued that a judicial stay for entrapment should be directed.  He claimed that
he had no intention of selling drugs on the day in question, but felt sorry for
the undercover officer; he agreed to sell only because he believed that his
friend wanted to meet a woman and that this was a way of gaining an
introduction.  The trial judge held that the police officer had engaged in
""random virtue testing"", which was unacceptable according to the
judgment of this Court in Mack, supra, and therefore ordered a judicial stay of the
proceedings.

 

                   The British
Columbia Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal and ordered a new trial.

 

Judgments Below

 

County Court of Vancouver (Leggatt Co. Ct. J.)

 

                   On the basis of the
judgment of this Court in R. v. Mack, supra, Leggatt Co. Ct. J. of the County Court of Vancouver held that the
undercover officer had engaged in ""random virtue testing"" and
therefore directed the entry of a judicial stay on the charges. 

 

                   The trial judge
based his decision on two principal conclusions. First, he believed that the
police investigation failed to target a sufficiently specific physical area
where it was suspected that crimes would be committed.  The accused was
approached some distance from the specific area where drug trafficking was
taking place most frequently.  Secondly, he found as a question of fact that
the police officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that the accused was
likely to traffic in illicit drugs. The trial judge stated:

 

                   The
Granville Mall, which is known as an area of considerable drug activity, is
also known in Vancouver as Theatre Row. I have described it as being in the
centre of Vancouver, and it contains a broad cross-section of commercial
activity, a lot of it oriented to the entertainment industry.  Many movie
theatres are contained in the mall area.

 

                   When
one examines the criteria used by this undercover officer as to who to approach
to try to induce a drug transaction, she is describing a very high percentage
of young citizens who are there for perfectly legitimate reasons.  No conduct
was observed on the part of the [accused] or his companion prior to the drug
purchase which would provide a reasonable suspicion that they were already
engaged in criminal activity.  The specific area of the purchase was a distance
from the area described by the staff sergeant as the most heavily frequented
area for drug traffickers, which was the sky train Granville Street entrance
area.  There was no evidence that the [accused] or his companion were observed
engaging in conduct which would lead to any suspicion.

 

                   Leggatt Co. Ct. J.
did not believe it was necessary to inquire as to mala fides on the part of the officer, since he
found that she had engaged in random virtue testing:

 

                   Now,
I make no finding of mala fides, but it is not reasonable on the facts at bar
to suspect that each person who matches the general criteria provided by the
undercover officer for her targets is engaged in drug trafficking.  In my view,
given this very general criteria, given the fact that the individual was not at
the immediate centre of drug trafficking, and given the fact there was no prior
observation of conduct which leads to a reasonable inference of guilt, I am of
the view that this particular undercover officer was conducting a random virtue
test as described by Mr. Justice Lamer, and clearly on the authorities this is
not acceptable.

 

British
Columbia Court of Appeal
(Hinkson J.A. for the Court)

(1990), 54 C.C.C. (3d) 368

 

                   The Court of Appeal
overturned the judgment of the County Court, deciding the question of law that
the facts did not give rise to a reasonable inference of entrapment.

 

                   Hinkson J.A.
rejected the accused's contention that the police department was required to
limit its investigation to ""specific targeted areas of the mall""
where drug-related crimes were most likely to be committed.  The police were
entitled, in his opinion, to carry out an investigation that focused on the
whole of the Granville Mall.  He stated at pp. 372-73:

 

                   In
my opinion, the decision in Mack does not support that contention.  The evidence at trial disclosed
that sales of narcotics took place up and down the mall and it was for that
reason that the undercover officer walked up and down the mall approaching persons
and providing an opportunity to sell illicit drugs to her.

 

                   In
reaching his conclusion that the undercover officer had entrapped the accused
into trafficking in cannabis resin, the trial judge rested his decision
upon the fact that the undercover agent did not have a reasonable suspicion
that the accused was selling drugs.  But he overlooked the fact that the
undercover officer was engaged in a bona fide investigation of criminal activity involving the
area of the Granville Mall and that she was entitled, therefore, to offer to
the accused an opportunity to sell drugs to her.  In doing so, she was not
engaged in random virtue-testing as described by Lamer J. in Mack.

 

                   The Court
accordingly ordered a new trial, at p. 373, to be held in order to determine
whether there had been entrapment under the second branch of the test in Mack, namely, ""to consider whether or
not the conduct of the undercover agent went beyond providing an opportunity
and induced the commission of the offence.""

 

Analysis

 

Did the
police officer engage in random virtue-testing?

 

                   To resolve this
appeal, this Court must consider whether the conduct of the undercover police
officer was acceptable in light of the guidelines set out in Mack, supra.  In Mack, I attempted to define the
circumstances in which police conduct in the course of investigating and
uncovering criminal activity ceases to be acceptable and, instead, amounts to
the unacceptable entrapment of individuals.  The defence of entrapment is based
on the notion that limits should be imposed on the ability of the police to
participate in the commission of an offence. As a general rule, it is expected
in our society that the police will direct their attention towards uncovering
criminal activity that occurs without their involvement.

 

                   As I summarized in Mack, at pp. 964-65, there are two
principal branches of the test for entrapment.  The defence is available when:

 

(a) 
the authorities provide a person with an opportunity to commit an offence
without acting on a reasonable suspicion that this person is already engaged in
criminal activity or pursuant to a bona fide inquiry;

 

(b) 
although having such a reasonable suspicion or acting in the course of a bona fide inquiry, they go beyond providing an
opportunity and induce the commission of an offence.

 

                                                                   .
. . 

 

                   The
absence of a reasonable suspicion or a bona fide inquiry is significant in assessing
the police conduct because of the risk that the police will attract people who
would not otherwise have any involvement in a crime and because it is not a
proper use of the police power to simply go out and test the virtue of people
on a random basis.

 

                   It is apparent that
the police officer involved in this case did not have a ""reasonable
suspicion"" that the accused was already engaged in unlawful drug-related
activity.  The factors that drew the officer's attention to this particular
accused -- his manner of dress, the length of his hair -- were not sufficient
to give rise to a reasonable suspicion that criminal acts were being
committed.  Furthermore, the subjectiveness of the officer's decision to
approach the accused, based on a ""hunch"" or ""feeling"" rather
than extrinsic evidence, also indicates that the accused did not, as an
individual, arouse a reasonable suspicion.

 

                   Consequently, the
police conduct in this case will amount to entrapment unless the officer
presented the accused with the opportunity to sell drugs in the course of a bona fide inquiry.  In my opinion, the police officer involved in
this case was engaged in such a bona fide investigation. First, there is no question that
the officer's conduct was motivated by the genuine purpose of investigating and
repressing criminal activity.  The police department had reasonable grounds for
believing that drug-related crimes were occurring throughout the Granville Mall
area.  The accused was not, therefore, approached for questionable motives
unrelated to the investigation and repression of crime.

 

                   Secondly, the
police department directed its investigation at a suitable area within the city
of Vancouver.  As I noted in Mack, supra, the police may present the opportunity to commit a particular crime to
persons who are associated with a location where it is reasonably suspected
that criminal activity is taking place.  I stated, at p. 956:

 

                   Of
course, in certain situations the police may not know the identity of specific
individuals, but they do know certain other facts, such as a particular
location or area where it is reasonably suspected that certain criminal
activity is occurring.  In those cases it is clearly permissible to provide
opportunities to people associated with the location under suspicion, even if
these people are not themselves under suspicion.

 

The police department in this case
focused its investigation on an area of Vancouver, a section of Granville
Street covering approximately six city blocks, where it was reasonably
suspected that drug-related crimes were occurring.  In my opinion, they would
not have been able to deal with the problem effectively had they restricted the
investigation to a smaller area. Although there were particular areas within
the Granville Mall where drug trafficking was especially serious, it is true
that trafficking occurred at locations scattered generally throughout the
Mall.  It is also true that traffickers did not operate in a single place.  It
would be unrealistic for the police to focus their investigation on one
specific part of the Mall given the tendency of traffickers to modify their
techniques in response to police investigations.  The trial judge admitted that
the Mall was ""known as an area of considerable drug activity"". 
Similarly, the Court of Appeal found support in the evidence given at trial by
Staff Sergeant Davies of the Vancouver City Police.  In discussing the police
department's activities in 1988, Staff Sergeant Davies indicated, at p. 370,
that:

 

(a)Of
the 2,294 persons charged with drug offences, approximately 22% were from
incidents in the Granville Mall area;

 

(b)506
arrests were made on the mall resulting in 659 charges -- 289 for trafficking,
199 for possession for the purpose of trafficking;

 

(c)315
arrests were made in ""buy and bust"" operations resulting in 475
charges.

 

The Court of Appeal concluded, at p.
372:

 

The
evidence at trial disclosed that sales of narcotics took place up and down the
mall and it was for that reason that the undercover officer walked up and down
the mall approaching persons and providing an opportunity to sell illicit drugs
to her.

 

                   It is, therefore,
my opinion that the police department was engaged, in these circumstances, in a bona fide inquiry. 

 

                   I note that in many
cases, the size of the area itself may indicate that the investigation is not bona fide.  This will be so particularly when
there are grounds for believing that the criminal activity being investigated
is concentrated in part of a larger area targeted by the police.  In this case,
however, for the reasons discussed above, it was reasonable for the Vancouver
Police Department to focus its investigation on the Granville Mall.

 

                   The accused argues
that although the undercover officer was involved in a bona fide inquiry, she nevertheless engaged in
random virtue-testing since she approached the accused without a reasonable
suspicion that he was likely to commit a drug-related offence.  She approached
the accused simply because he was walking near Granville Street.

 

                   In my respectful
opinion, this argument is based on a misinterpretation of Mack. I recognize that some of my language
in Mack might
be responsible for this misinterpretation.  In particular, as noted above, I
stated, at p. 956:

 

In
those cases [where there is a particular location where it is reasonably
suspected that certain crimes are taking place] it is clearly permissible to
provide opportunities to people associated with the location under suspicion,
even if these people are not themselves under suspicion. This latter situation,
however, is only justified if the police acted in the course of a bona fide investigation and are not engaged in
random virtue-testing.

 

                   This statement
should not be taken to mean that the police may not approach people on a random
basis, in order to present the opportunity to commit an offence, in the course
of a bona fide
investigation.  The basic rule articulated in Mack is that the police may only present
the opportunity to commit a particular crime to an individual who arouses a
suspicion that he or she is already engaged in the particular criminal activity. 
An exception to this rule arises when the police undertake a bona fide investigation directed at an area
where it is reasonably suspected that criminal activity is occurring.  When
such a location is defined with sufficient precision, the police may present any
person associated with the area with the opportunity to commit the particular
offence.  Such randomness is permissible within the scope of a bona fide inquiry.

 

                   Random
virtue-testing, conversely, only arises when a police officer presents a person
with the opportunity to commit an offence without a reasonable suspicion
that:

 

(a) 
the person is already engaged in the particular criminal activity, or

 

(b) 
the physical location with which the person is associated is a place where the
particular criminal activity is likely occurring.

 

                   In this case, the
accused was approached by the officer when he was walking near the Granville
Mall.  The notion of being ""associated"" with a particular area for
these purposes does not require more than being present in the area.  As
a result, the accused was associated with a location where it was reasonably
believed that drug-related crimes were occurring. The officer's conduct was
therefore justified under the first branch of the test for entrapment set out
in Mack.

 

                   For these reasons,
it is my opinion that the officer did not engage in random virtue-testing in
this case.  I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal and uphold the decision of
the Court of Appeal ordering a new trial.

 

Does this
Court have jurisdiction, as a result of the finding that the police officer did
not engage in random virtue-testing, to enter convictions with respect to the
three charges?

 

                   As noted above, the
accused was found guilty at trial of trafficking in cannabis resin, of the
included offence of possession of cannabis resin for the purpose of
trafficking, and of possession of marijuana.  The trial judge entered a
judicial stay with respect to the three offences on the grounds that the
accused was entrapped.  The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal, arguing that
the Court should overturn the trial judge's decision and enter convictions with
respect to the three charges.  The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's
appeal, but ordered a new trial to determine whether there had been
entrapment pursuant to the second branch of the Mack test.  Entrapment occurs under the
second branch if the police go beyond providing the opportunity for a person to
commit an offence and induce the commission of the offence.

 

                   The Crown now
submits that this Court, having found that there was no entrapment under the
first branch of the Mack test, should enter convictions with respect to the three offences. 
This submission turns on the assumption that it cannot be reasonably inferred
from the evidence adduced at trial that the police officer induced the
commission of the offence.  The accused submits that this Court should not
accede to the Crown's request, since the Crown did not cross-appeal the portion
of the Court of Appeal's order directing that a new trial be held.

 

                   In my opinion, this
Court does not have jurisdiction to vary the Court of Appeal's order at the
request of the Crown, in the absence of an appeal by the Crown.  The Crown had
no ability to appeal, by right or by leave, the decision of the Court of Appeal
to this Court.  Section 693(1)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , sets out the
situations when the Crown may appeal to this Court:

 

                   693. (1) Where a judgment of a court of
appeal sets aside a conviction pursuant to an appeal taken under section 675 or
dismisses an appeal taken pursuant to paragraph 676(1)(a), (b) or (c) or subsection 676(3), the Attorney
General may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada

 

(a) on any question of law on which a
judge of the court of appeal dissents; or

 

(b) on any question of law, if leave to
appeal is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada.

 

The Court of Appeal in this case allowed
an appeal by the Crown from a judicial stay of proceedings ordered at trial. 
As noted by this Court in R. v. Jewitt, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 128, at p. 148, a stay of
proceedings is, for all practical purposes, ""tantamount to a judgment or
verdict of acquittal"".  As a result, the Crown, under s. 693(1) , neither
had a right to appeal nor to apply for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's
decision to this Court. Furthermore, the Crown was unable to apply for leave to
appeal under the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. S-26 , by virtue of s. 40(3) of
the Act.

 

                   The Crown submits
that the decision by the accused to appeal to this Court invokes the
application of s. 695(1)  of the Criminal Code . Section 695(1)  provides as follows:

 

                   695. (1)  The Supreme Court of Canada
may, on an appeal under this Part, make any order that the court of appeal
might have made and may make any rule or order that is necessary to give effect
to its judgment.

 

The Crown argues that since the Court
of Appeal had jurisdiction under s. 686(4) (b)(ii) to enter convictions with
respect to the three charges, s. 695(1)  gives this Court jurisdiction to do the
same.  With respect, I disagree with the Crown's contention.  Section 695(1) 
does not allow this Court to make, in all circumstances, a decision that we
believe the Court of Appeal could have and should have made.  As was held in
Guillemette v. The Queen,
[1986] 1 S.C.R. 356, this Court has jurisdiction under s. 695(1)  to modify an
order at the request of the Crown when there is an appeal by the Crown asking
us to do so. I stated in Guillemette, at p. 364: 

 

                   Where
there is no appeal by the Crown asking us to do so, this Court cannot, in place
of the Court of Appeal, make the order which we might feel it should have made
....

 

When there is no appeal by the Crown,
an accused cannot leave this Court with less than what he gained from the court
of appeal.

 

                   In the absence of
an appeal by the Crown, this Court has no jurisdiction to allow the Crown's
request that the order below be modified. To hold otherwise would allow the
Crown to appeal to this Court where such an opportunity has not been provided
by the Criminal Code 
or the Supreme Court Act .  The Crown is not given by statute the ability to appeal to this
Court a decision which allowed its appeal from an acquittal or judicial
stay of proceedings, but which gave the Crown less than what had been
requested.  As a result, there is no statutory provision which would allow the
Crown to appeal from the Court of Appeal's judgment. Absent a statutory right
of appeal, there is no right of appeal.

 

Disposition

 

                   For the reasons
given above, I would dismiss the accused's appeal and uphold the decision of
the Court of Appeal ordering a new trial.

 

//L'Heureux-Dubé J.//

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   L'Heureux-Dubé J. (dissenting in part) -- I have had the benefit of the
reasons of the Chief Justice but am nevertheless compelled to reach a different
conclusion concerning the jurisdiction of this Court to enter convictions
regarding the three charges stayed by the trial judge.  As the Chief Justice's
resolution of the entrapment issue commends itself to me, I will only address
the second issue raised by this case, the jurisdiction issue.

 

Proceedings

 

                   As the Chief
Justice has set out the facts and summarized the judgments of the courts below,
it is not necessary to refer to them at length.  For ease of reference,
however, I will set out a brief summary of the proceedings in this case.

 

                   At trial, the
accused was charged with: (1) trafficking in cannabis resin, (2) possession of
cannabis resin for the purpose of trafficking, and (3) possession of
marijuana.  He was found guilty of counts (1) and (3) and of the included
offence of possession regarding the second count.  The issue at trial, then,
was whether or not a stay should be directed, on the ground that the accused
had been entrapped.  The trial judge held that Barnes had indeed been entrapped
and directed the entry of a stay on the three counts.

 

                   The Crown
appealed.  The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, concluding that entrapment
did not lie on the facts of the case, and, in spite of vigorous contrary
arguments by the Crown, ordered a new trial on the issue of whether the
""defence"" of entrapment, on the second branch of the test set out in R. v. Mack, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, could be made
out on the facts.

 

                   Barnes appealed to
this Court, ""as of right"" that is, under the statutory direction of
s. 691(2) (a)
of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  As the Chief Justice states, at p. 000, ""[t]he
Crown had no ability to appeal, by right or by leave, the decision of the Court
of Appeal to this Court.""   Thus, there is no Crown appeal as such arising
for consideration in this case.

 

Analysis

 

                   At the outset, we
must be clear that the appeal presently before this Court was instituted by
Barnes, the accused.  He is appealing from the judgment of the Court of Appeal
allowing the Crown's appeal of the stay and ordering a new trial.  The Crown
did not appeal the order for a new trial to this Court since the Criminal
Code  does not provide
for such an appeal by the Crown.  Given that, in my respectful opinion, the
accused's appeal to this Court must fail on the issue of entrapment, the
remaining question is whether the order for a new trial by the Court of Appeal
can be set aside, and convictions entered, absent an appeal by the Crown.

 

The General
Rule Regarding Appellate Jurisdiction

 

                   As the Chief
Justice rightly points out, the general rule is that an appellate court cannot
disturb a verdict of acquittal or, in any other respect, modify an order such
as the one made here directing a new trial, absent an appeal by the Crown
asking it to do so.  Appellate jurisdiction is conferred entirely by statute. 
This general rule regarding appellate court jurisdiction has been affirmed in a
number of recent cases from this Court.  The reasons for such a rule are
obvious -- in most circumstances, to proceed otherwise would expose the accused
to unfairness and prejudice, due to the lack of notice regarding the scope of
the appellate proceedings and the lack of prior warning as to the degree to
which the accused has been placed in jeopardy.

 

                   In Rickard v.
The Queen, [1970]
S.C.R. 1022, Ritchie J., for the majority, held that whether or not the Crown
can in fact appeal in the circumstances of a particular case is irrelevant, but
rather, the ""controlling factor"" is merely whether the Crown has
appealed the acquittal or order.

 

                   Lamer J. (as he
then was), reiterated the general rule in Guillemette v. The
Queen, [1986] 1
S.C.R. 356, when, speaking for the Court, he stated at p. 361: 

 

                   In
ordering a new trial on the original charge of second-degree murder, the Court
of Appeal in the same breath set aside the acquittal implicitly made by the
jury on that charge.  Where there has been no appeal by the Crown, to allow
this result, which only the Crown was entitled to seek, constitutes an error of
law.

 

See also R. v. Provo, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 3, at p. 21.

 

                   That this is a rule
of general application is beyond dispute.  There are situations, however, in
which the laudable rationales underlying this rule are inoperative and, as
such, these situations are treated differently in terms of the application of
the general rule.  One such situation, already recognized by this Court, deals
with circumstances where the rule against multiple convictions, or the Kienapple principle, is triggered.

 

The Rule
Against Multiple Convictions

 

                   Before considering
the so-called Kienapple exception to the general rule regarding appellate court jurisdiction,
it may be helpful to briefly recall the nature of the Kienapple principle itself.  The doctrine of res
judicata, which has
evolved alongside other doctrines designed to prevent unfairness to the
accused, has a long history in the criminal law.  These doctrines prohibit the
trying of an accused twice for the same offence.  The decision of this Court in Kienapple
v. The Queen, [1975]
1 S.C.R. 729, extended the traditional formulation of res
judicata to cover
situations where an accused is charged with offences having a close factual and
legal relationship.  Simply stated, the rule against multiple convictions, or
the Kienapple
principle, ""proposes that an individual should not be subjected to more
than one conviction arising out of the same ""cause or matter"" or the
same ""delict"", consisting of a single criminal act committed in
circumstances where the offences alleged are comprised of the same or
substantially the same facts and elements"", (see Jordan, ""Application
and Limitations of the Rule Prohibiting Multiple Convictions: Kienapple v. The
Queen to R. v. Prince"" (1985), 14 Man. L.J. 341).

 

                   As Laskin J. (as he
then was), for the majority, in Kienapple v. The Queen, supra, pointed out, the rule formulated in
that case is a logical application of res judicata.  He noted that other concepts such
as autrefois convict and issue estoppel are, as they have been traditionally construed,
inappropriate in dealing with the cases envisaged by the rule against multiple
convictions.  Laskin J. framed the relevant inquiry in these terms, at p. 750:

 

. .
. whether the same cause or matter (rather than the same offence) is
comprehended by two or more offences.

 

                   In R. v.
Prince, [1986] 2
S.C.R. 480, at p. 486, this Court comprehensively reexamined the ""nature
and scope of the principle of res judicata articulated for the majority by Laskin J."" 
While the rule itself remained intact, Chief Justice Dickson, for the Court,
set out at length the nature of the questions to be asked in a determination of
the application of the rule.  The focus of an inquiry into the proper
application of the rule must be guided by discussions going to the factual and
legal nexus between the offences.

 

                   In order to give
practical effect to the rule against multiple convictions, the courts in this
country have devised a procedure wherein a judicial stay of the convictions is
entered in order to avoid contravention of the rule.  This will be discussed in
more depth below, along with the effect this procedure has on the general rule
regarding appellate jurisdiction.  What is more at issue here is the effect of
such a procedure as regards appellate jurisdiction.  Parliament has not chosen
to provide a rule accommodating this situation, so we have to turn to the
methods devised by the courts to meet the problems created by this rule.

 

The
Procedure Implementing the Rule Against Multiple Convictions and its Effect on
the General Rule Regarding Appellate Jurisdiction

 

                   Due to the
operation of the rule against multiple convictions, an exception to the general
rule regarding Crown appeals and appellate jurisdiction has been formulated. 
This exception was first implicitly recognized in R. v. Terlecki (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 522 (Alta.
C.A.), aff'd [1985] 2 S.C.R. 483, and then later, explicitly, in Provo,
supra.  This
exception was recognized in order to ""accommodate the special relationship
between offences which arise out of the same delict and are subject to special
treatment under the rule against multiple convictions.""  (See R. v.
Provo, supra,
at p. 21).

 

                   In Terlecki, supra, the Alberta Court of
Appeal set out the procedure to be followed in a Kienapple situation.  They also noted that, in
the context of the rule against multiple convictions, an exception should be
made regarding the necessity of a Crown appeal from the stayed charges, or
""acquittals"".  According to the Alberta Court of Appeal, guilt or
innocence regarding the various charges giving rise to the Kienapple principle should be determined at the
outset.  If the accused is found guilty of the charges, a conditional stay is
entered on the less serious charge, in order to avoid running afoul of the
principle.  If the accused successfully appeals the conviction, the appellate
court is able, absent an appeal by the Crown, to remit the matter back
to the trial judge for the entry of a conviction on the charge conditionally
stayed but upon which the trial judge has previously determined guilt.  In
upholding the judgment of the Court of Appeal, this Court generally approved of
the procedure set out by the Alberta Court of Appeal.

 

                   In Provo, supra, Justice Wilson, for
the Court, discussed the practical and policy reasons for the use of a
conditional stay in these circumstances but also explicitly approved of the
""Kienapple
exception"" to the general rule respecting appellate court jurisdiction
due, as set out previously, to the nature of the relationship between the
offences in such a situation.

 

                   Where the rule
against multiple convictions is operative, the general rule is inapplicable. 
The ""acquittal"" on one or more of the charges is not an acquittal in
the sense that the accused has not been found guilty, i.e., ""that the
state had not met its burden of proving the elements of the offence"" --
see Provo, supra,
at p. 17 -- but only in the sense that there exists an overriding rationale,
discussed above, for staying the charges.  The general rule has little meaning
in a situation where the Kienapple principle applies, as the accused must be taken to be cognizant of the
fact that the continued effect of the ""acquittal"", is lifted and the
conviction reinstated should the Crown's appeal of the stay, by appealing the
application of the rule itself, be successful or should the accused
successfully appeal one of the convictions.  An ""acquittal"", that the
general rule would require the Crown to appeal, is contingent upon the Crown's
successful appeal of the stay or upon the successful appeal by the accused of
the conviction.  Upon a successful appeal of the stay or conviction, understandably,
the ""acquittal"" is no longer meaningful or effective, as the reason
for its existence in the first place, the Kienapple principle, is gone.  There is really,
nothing of substance for the Crown to appeal.  In these circumstances arguments
about prejudice and fairness to the accused have little merit.

 

                   How does an
entrapment situation, as in the case here, relate to a Kienapple situation?  Before answering this
question I will examine the nature and scope of an entrapment inquiry and
determine whether, in the present instance, either of the two branches of an
entrapment inquiry have been satisfied.  Further, was the Court of Appeal
justified in ordering a new trial on the second branch of the inquiry?

 

Entrapment

 

                   Though this Court's
first notable examination of entrapment took place in Amato v.
The Queen, [1982] 2
S.C.R. 418, the leading authority is Mack, supra, wherein Lamer J. (as
he then was), for a unanimous Court, articulated the rationales for and the
parameters of what is now known as the ""defence"" of entrapment.  It
is within this discussion that he sets out the two branches of an entrapment
inquiry, at p. 959:

 

                   There
is, therefore, entrapment when:  (a) the authorities provide an opportunity to
persons to commit an offence without reasonable suspicion or acting mala fides, . . . or, (b) having a reasonable
suspicion or acting in the course of a bona fide inquiry, they go beyond providing an
opportunity and induce the commission of an offence.

 

                   As I stated
earlier, I agree fully with the Chief Justice's disposition of the entrapment
issue in the present case.  Before going to the issue of jurisdiction, however,
I will briefly discuss the second arm of the entrapment inquiry since it is at
the heart of the Court of Appeal's order for a new trial. 

 

                   In Mack, supra, what constitutes
""inducing"" the commission of an offence, is distinguished from the
permissible provision of a mere opportunity, and, thus, defines what will
constitute entrapment on the second arm of the test.  The central question in
this form of entrapment is ""have the police gone further than providing an
opportunity and instead employed tactics designed to induce someone into the
commission of an offence?"" (see p. 959.)  In considering this question,
Lamer J. cautions that it must be answered in light of ""the average person
in the position of the accused"" and sets out a non-exhaustive list of
factors that will assist in formulating the answer.  This list includes, among
others, such factors as the persistence of the police, whether rewards, deceit
or exploitation are employed, disproportionate involvement of the police as
compared to the accused and the existence of threats, veiled or otherwise.

 

                   Prior to applying
this test, it should be noted that the trial judge, in the present case, did
pursue the ""preferable and safe course of making findings on all the
counts charged"" (Provo, supra, at p. 17).  That there was no realistic debate about
the guilt of the accused is apparent from the record and from the fact that the
accused raised no ""defence"" other than one of entrapment.  As regards
entrapment, the trial judge did not need to determine whether entrapment on the
second branch of the test, as set out in Mack, supra, was satisfied here,
since he found entrapment based on the first branch of the test.  He did,
however, clearly set out that portion of the transaction relevant to this
question in the following extract of his reasons:

 

The
female undercover officer was part of a buy-and-bust operation conducted by the
Vancouver Police Department.  She saw the Accused at the northwest corner of
Georgia and Granville, waiting for the light to change. . . . The undercover
officer approached the Defendant and asked, ""Got any weed?""  He
answered no.  His partner then said to him, ""She wants some weed."" 
The Defendant then looked over the undercover officer and again said no.  She
then said, ""Come on, what have you got?""  He said, ""Hash.  It's
gold.""  She said, ""How much?""  He said, ""15."" 
""Okay.""  The three went into a doorway.  He pulled out a small
package and took a small portion from it.  She gave him a marked $20 bill, got
$4 in change, and left.  That is pretty well the extent of the transaction. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   I fully agree with
the Crown's description of this transaction as being of the ""briefest
duration"" and as ""providing the barest of opportunities to an
individual to engage in criminal activity"".  It is obvious, from a
discussion of the relevant legal principles applicable to entrapment going to
the second branch of the test, and the findings of fact made by the trial
judge, that there is no ""live"" issue regarding the second branch of
the entrapment test.  While, admittedly, certain issues, such as issues of
guilt or innocence, are fraught with difficult determinations going to the
state of mind of an accused and, thus, are best left to the trial judge, this
is clearly not the case here.  Once this Court rejected the arguments of the
accused going to the first branch of the entrapment inquiry, it is painfully
clear that there was no point to the entrapment arguments of the accused.  In
fact, the primary, if not the sole, thrust of the accused's defence, evidenced
through the proceedings at trial, was that the police had engaged in random
virtue-testing not that the accused had been induced to commit a crime.

 

                   Everything I have
said above makes clear why the defence proceeded in the manner it did.  It
appears, from the record and from the manner in which the accused conducted his
defence, that, should the accused's appeal be dismissed, there was no
expectation of success on any further ground or argument going to entrapment. 
In this light, it is as unreal to entertain arguments of prejudice to the
accused in entering convictions as it is to order a new trial in such
circumstances.  Considering the entire set of circumstances in this case, the
lack of adjudication by the trial judge regarding the second branch of the
entrapment test can neither prevent the entering of a conviction nor justify
the order for a new trial on that issue.  Accordingly, I am respectfully of the
view that the Court of Appeal erred in ordering a new trial on this second
branch of the test of entrapment in the circumstances of this case.  

 

                   My conclusions in
this regard are supported by this Court's unanimous decision in R. v.
Cassidy, [1989] 2
S.C.R. 345, wherein this Court considered the nature of the Court of Appeal's
ability, under s. 613(4)(b)(ii)
of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, (now s. 686(4) (b)(ii)), to enter a conviction rather
than order a new trial.  Lamer J. (as he then was), for the Court, set out
within the context of the argument advanced by the Crown, the circumstances
within which a court of appeal can properly exercise such a power, at p.
354-55:

 

                   The
Crown replies that the Court of Appeal may allow a Crown appeal against an
acquittal entered by a trial judge and substitute a verdict of guilty where the
Crown establishes that an error of law was committed at trial, satisfies the
Court of Appeal that, had there been a proper application of the law, the
verdict would not have been the same, and further demonstrates that the
accused should have been found guilty but for the error of law.  In this
respect, the principle that has been established at common law is that all the
findings necessary to support a verdict of guilty must have been made, either
explicitly or implicitly, or not be in issue.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

                   It is clear that
these prerequisites have been satisfied in the instant case.  Given that
conclusion, the question remains whether this Court, in overturning the
judgment of the Court of Appeal on this issue, can direct the entry of
convictions, absent an appeal by the Crown from the order of the Court of
Appeal.

 

Situations Logically
Falling Within the Scope of the Kienapple Exception

 

                   As I have stated at
the outset, the general rule regarding the jurisdiction of appellate courts is
based on compelling rationales, largely, the potential prejudice occasioned an
accused, absent an appeal by the Crown.  However, as the Kienapple exception demonstrates, this general
rule does have legitimate exceptions that fall outside of the concerns
protected by it.  In my view, the present case offers convincing reasons for
treating it in the same fashion as one would a situation falling more squarely
within this previously articulated exception.  While I will attempt to clarify
how this is so, I would first like to make it plain that I do not wish to lay
waste to the general rule.  As I hope to show, situations of a similar nature,
illustrated by this case, warrant similar treatment.  An examination of the
factors in the present case that lead me to this result, however, also make it
plain that the result here will not lead to any significant number of
inclusions in the ""exceptional"" category.

 

                   To begin with, the
procedure in a Kienapple situation is similar in many respects to that in an entrapment
situation.  In both, a preliminary determination of guilt regarding the charge
or charges is made.  Subsequent to this determination, the trial judge must
consider whether a stay should be entered for reason of entrapment or due to
the rule against multiple convictions.  If a stay is ordered, the stayed
charges are treated as ""acquittals"" for the purpose of an appeal: see R. v.
Jewitt, [1985] 2
S.C.R. 128.  The similarity of the proceedings in a situation of entrapment and
the rule against multiple convictions, and the policy considerations behind
them are discussed by Wilson J., for the Court, in Provo, supra, at pp. 17-18:

 

The
accused who would be guilty of an offence except for the application of the
rule against multiple convictions is not, in my view, deserving of an acquittal
in the true sense that the state had not met its burden of proving the elements
of the offence.  If, as is the case here, the trial court pursues the
preferable and safe course of making findings on all the counts charged, it
will be clear that all the elements of the offence have been proved against the
accused even if the registering of a conviction is barred for the policy
reasons underlying the Kienapple principle.  The policy considerations
here are analogous to those which apply when proceedings against an accused are
stayed because of entrapment.  They are concerned with the integrity and fairness of the
administration of justice rather than with the culpability of the accused . . .
.  The trial judge should determine whether the accused is entitled to an
acquittal before the independent policies of either the rule against entrapment
or the rule against multiple convictions is applied. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   It can be seen
that, like the situation in a Kienapple context, the full force of the general rule
obliging the Crown to appeal, is avoided in an entrapment situation due, as
discussed above, to the nature of the proceedings and the underpinnings of the
""acquittal"" entered in such situations.  Further, the position in
which the Crown finds itself, after an appeal by the accused in an entrapment
situation, is closely analogous to that in a Kienapple context.  There is, in most
instances, nothing meaningful for the Crown to appeal.  If the Crown's appeal
is successful and the entrapment arguments of the accused are unsuccessful on
appeal, the stay will be ""lifted"" or set aside and the convictions
will stand.  As in a Kienapple situation, the ""acquittal"" fails to remain relevant after
the entrapment issue is dispensed with and an accused cannot ignore that
necessary result.  Requiring the Crown to appeal the ""acquittal"" in
order to formalize this necessary consequence is nothing more than a
meaningless formality, a formality easily dispensed with in a Kienapple
situation.  The same result, in my view, should also obtain in an entrapment
situation, both either/or situations.

 

Conclusion

 

                   In summary, holding
to the general rule in cases of this nature smacks of formulaic justice.  The
analogy with Kienapple situations shows that similar circumstances involving similar
rationales justify similar conclusions.  In my respectful view, it is not
possible in this particular case, to rely on the rationales underlying the
general rule to support the conclusion reached by the Chief Justice.  With the
issue of the applicability of the general rule and prejudice to the accused
fairly dispensed with, what is most compelling, in these circumstances, is to
apply the logic supporting the exception made in the Kienapple context.  Since the entrapment issue,
in the circumstances of this case, is no longer a live issue, there is no need
to order a new trial, given the findings of guilt of the trial judge on all
three counts charged.  Consequently, the stay entered at trial should be set
aside and convictions should be entered, even absent an appeal from the Crown
to this Court from the Court of Appeal's order for a new trial on the second
branch of the entrapment ""defence"".

 

Disposition

 

                   I would dismiss the
appellant's appeal but would quash the order of the Court of Appeal for a new
trial and remit the matter back to the trial judge for entry of convictions on
the three counts and imposition of sentence.

 

//McLachlin J.//

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   McLachlin J. (dissenting) -- This appeal
raises the question of when undercover police should be allowed to interfere
with members of the public who are not under suspicion.  This Court laid out
the basic principles governing undercover intrusion into private activity in R. v.
Mack, [1988] 2 S.C.R.
903.  The present case raises issues as to the ambit of the Mack test and its application.  With the
greatest respect, I cannot agree with the application of the Mack test adopted in this case by the
Court of Appeal and endorsed by my colleague, Chief Justice Lamer.   To accept
this application would, in my considered opinion, represent endorsing a measure
of state intrusion into the private affairs of citizens greater than any
heretofore sanctioned by this Court under the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms 
and out of step with the philosophy and principles which guided the decisions
of this Court in R. v. Dyment, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417;  R. v. Duarte, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30;  R. v.
Kokesch, [1990] 3
S.C.R. 3;  and R. v. Wong, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 36.  

 

                   I accept the test
for unlawful entrapment provided in Mack.  Entrapment occurs where:

 

(a) 
the authorities provide a person with an opportunity to commit an offence
without acting on a reasonable suspicion that this person is already engaged in
criminal activity or pursuant to a bona fide inquiry;

 

(b) 
although having such a reasonable suspicion or acting in the course of a bona fide inquiry, they go beyond providing an
opportunity and induce the commission of an offence.

 

                   In this case we are
concerned only with the latter aspect of the first branch of the test.   The
undercover policewoman who approached the accused had no reasonable suspicion
that he was engaged in criminal activity.  He was simply a not-too-well dressed
young person crossing a street. This leaves only one basis on which the police
can justify their activity -- that they were engaged in a bona fide inquiry.  

 

                   Lamer C.J. finds
that there was a bona fide inquiry in this case on the basis of two factors: (1) the officer's
conduct was motivated by the genuine purpose of investigating and repressing
criminal activity; and (2) the police department directed its investigation at
a location where it is reasonably suspected that criminal activity is taking
place.  He goes on to say that, notwithstanding an apparently contrary
statement in Mack, the presence of a bona fide inquiry eliminates any possibility of there being random
virtue-testing.  I, on the other hand, take the view that determining whether
the police were acting pursuant to a bona fide inquiry requires consideration of
more than the two factors referred to by Lamer C.J.  More particularly, it
involves consideration of whether the state's interest in repressing criminal
activity in the particular case outweighs the interest which individuals have
in being able to go about their daily lives without courting the risk that they
will be subjected to the clandestine investigatory techniques of agents of the
state.  I base this view on the considerations underlying the concept of
unlawful entrapment, as well as the language used in Mack.

 

                   The reasoning in Mack recognizes that the law of entrapment
is based on a balance between conflicting interests.  On the one hand lie the
individual's interests -- the interest in being left alone, free from state
intrusion, and the interest in not being induced by the state to commit an
offence (Mack, at p. 941).  On the other lies the state's competing interest in
protecting society from crime.  Lamer J. (as he then was) puts it thus in Mack, at pp. 941-42:

 

                   The
competing social interest is in the repression of criminal activity.  Further,
our dependance [sic] on the police to actively protect us from the
immense social and personal cost of crime must be acknowledged.  There will be
differing views as to the appropriate balance between the concepts of fairness
and justice and the need for protection from crime but it is my opinion that it
is universally recognized that some balance is absolutely essential to our
conception of civilized society.  In deciding where the balance lies in
any given case it is necessary to recall the key elements of our model of
fairness and justice, as this is the only manner in which we can judge the
legitimacy of a particular law enforcement technique.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   Mack therefore stands for the proposition
that determination of entrapment must involve a balancing between the
individual interest in being left alone and the state's interest in the
repression of crime.  Only where considerations such as fairness, justice and
the need for protection from crime tip the balance in favour of the state will
police conduct which offends the individual interests at stake be acceptable.

 

                   The significance of
the individual interest at stake here must not be underestimated, nor should
the adverse effect that police investigatory techniques can have on this
interest be overlooked.  This Court has frequently emphasized that limits must
be placed on the state's ability to intrude into the daily lives of its
citizens.  As Justice La Forest stated in R. v. Dyment, supra, at pp. 427-28, in a
passage adopted by Justice Sopinka for the majority in R. v.
Kokesch, supra,
""The restraints imposed on government to pry into the lives of the citizen
go to the essence of a democratic state"".  Furthermore, in R. v. Wong, supra, at p. 53, La
Forest J., for the majority, acknowledged that our society is one which
""sets a premium on being left alone"".  

 

                   To paraphrase
La Forest J. in Wong, supra, the notion is that individuals should be free to go
about their daily business -- to go shopping, to visit the theatre, to travel
to and from work, to name but three examples -- without courting the risk that
they will be subjected to the clandestine investigatory techniques of agents of
the state.  A further risk inherent in overbroad undercover operations is that
of discriminatory police work, where people are interfered with not because of
reasonable suspicion but because of the colour of their skin or, as in this
case, the quality of their clothing and their age.

 

                   It follows, from
the fact that the concept of unlawful entrapment represents a balancing of
conflicting interests, that the test for entrapment must likewise permit the
measuring of relative harms.  A test which does not permit weighing of the
infringement on individual freedom and privacy in determining whether
entrapment has occurred is to that extent deficient.  As Lamer J. put it in the
passage cited in Mack, what must be determined ""in any given case"" is where the
proper balance lies.

 

                   While comments of
Lamer J. in Mack on what constitutes a bona fide inquiry leave room for consideration of the
individual interest in being left alone and not being induced into crime, the
application of Mack proposed by him in this case permits little or no recognition of the
interest of the individual in being left alone.   All that is required is that
the police act from a proper motive and that there be a suspicion of criminal
activity within a general geographic area targeted by the police.  That
established, there is no room for consideration of factors vital to the
balancing process, for example, the size of the area, the number of innocent
people going about legitimate activities who might be interfered with by the
operation,  and the seriousness of the crime in question.

 

                   In advocating a
more refined test for bona fide inquiry than does Lamer C.J., I am motivated by concern for the
implications of the test he proposes.   That test would permit the police to
extend their Granville Mall operation to all of Vancouver if statistics could
be found to suggest that drug offences were occurring throughout Vancouver
generally.  The example is extreme.   Yet it indicates the deficiency I see in
the test proposed by Lamer C.J.  In my view, a more sensitive test than that
proposed by Lamer C.J.  --  one which permits appreciation of all
relevant factors -- is required.

 

                   I conclude that
determination that the police were operating in the course of a bona fide inquiry within the meaning of Mack requires the Court to consider not
only the motive of the police and whether there is crime in the general area,
but also other factors relevant to the balancing process, such as the
likelihood of crime at the particular location targeted, the seriousness of the
crime in question, the number of legitimate activities and persons who might be
affected, and the availability of other less intrusive investigative
techniques.  In the final analysis, the question is whether the interception at
the particular location where it took place was reasonable having regard to the
conflicting interests of private citizens in being left alone from state
interference and of the state in suppressing crime.  If the answer to this
question is yes, then the inquiry is bona fide.

 

                   In proposing a test
that involves the balancing of conflicting interests, I am not insensitive to
the criticism sometimes made that balancing formulas may lack certainty and
predictability and accord too much discretion to reviewing judges. 
Notwithstanding such criticisms, a balancing approach remains the only rational
way to address problems such as that presented in this case.  Balancing
formulas provide a way of channelling diverse information into an analytic
framework, a framework which, while perhaps less than precise, is far superior
to voting by ""gut reaction"".  A balancing process, where conflicting
interests are articulated and weighed against each other, forces us to face
squarely the real policy issues involved in the case, to make explicit what
otherwise, rightly or wrongly, may be assumed.  Our constitutional law is
embedded in the notion of defining and balancing strongly felt interests in
society.  The rules which elaborate that law must address the same concerns.

 

                   In point of fact,
the test which I propose offers sufficient guidance to the police, in my view. 
It may reasonably be predicted, for example, that where there is no evidence of
the likelihood of offences being committed at the place where the undercover
operative is stationed, the interception is unlikely to be bona fide in the absence of a countervailing
state interest of compelling proportions.

 

                   Having set out the
considerations which should be addressed in determining whether an inquiry is bona fide, I turn to the facts of this case.  In
my view, the factors to which I have referred negate Lamer C.J.'s conclusion
that the entire Granville Mall represents a suitable area within the city of
Vancouver for the carrying out of a bona fide police inquiry.  Granville Mall, located in
downtown Vancouver, occupies a six-block stretch of Granville Street, a major
north-south thoroughfare running through the entire city.   The diversity of
the Granville Mall area -- which features theatres and restaurants, major
department stores, large office towers, and within the radius of one block, the
Vancouver Art Gallery, convention facilities and the Law Courts  -- means that
on a daily basis literally thousands of individuals will frequent the Mall and
thus fall subject to the clandestine investigatory techniques of the police on
the policy proposed in this case.

 

                   Lamer C.J.
bases his conclusion that targeting the entirety of Granville Mall as a site
for undercover operations constituted a bona fide police inquiry, on the absence of
improper motive and the fact that it was reasonably suspected that drug-related
crimes were occurring on the mall.  He refers to the trial judge's observation
that Granville Mall is ""known as an area of considerable drug
activity"".   With the greatest respect, I cannot agree with Lamer C.J.'s
conclusion at p. 000 that ""[it] would be unrealistic for the police to
focus their investigation on one specific part of the Mall"".  There is no
evidence whatsoever that trafficking took place at the location of the
undercover interception.  Nor is there any evidence that traffickers
systematically rotated locations to avoid detection.  Indeed, the trial judge,
in ordering a stay of proceedings, noted the legitimate character of much of
the mall and held that the accused ""was not at the immediate centre of
drug trafficking"".  What evidence there is, established that the Granville
Mall Skytrain station is known to the police as the ""hub"" of drug
activity on the mall.  That information suggests that it would be perfectly
realistic for the police to focus their investigation on one specific part of
the mall -- namely, the very hub of drug activity, the Skytrain station.

 

                   As indicated above,
I cannot agree that the fact that crime may be said to occur generally within a
given area suffices to establish a bona fide inquiry, given proper police motives.  Other
factors must be considered.  The first is the likelihood of crime in the
particular area targeted.  There was no evidence that trafficking was likely to
occur in the intersection where the accused was intercepted -- the intersection
between a major hotel, an office tower and two department stores.  On the
contrary, as the finding of the trial judge reflects, drug trafficking was
centred elsewhere on the mall.  The fact that trafficking occurred at different
locations in the six-block area of the mall does not establish that trafficking
was likely to occur at the intersection where the accused was intercepted.

 

                   What evidence there
is of drug activity on Granville Mall came from Staff Sergeant Kenneth Michael
Davies, who, significantly, was called as ""an expert in the areas of
police enforcements [sic] practice and techniques regarding drug enforcement in the Granville
Mall area and the downtown Vancouver area and, in particular, the operation of
undercover operations"".  Staff Sergeant Davies noted that the hub of drug
activity on Granville Mall had migrated northward from the McDonald's
restaurant to the Skytrain station.   He also stated that recently a greater
proportion of the drug trafficking has been occurring indoors, in bars and
restaurants along the mall.  He offered no evidence whatsoever that the
particular intersection in question here -- Granville and Georgia -- had ever
been a known site of drug activity.   Moreover, in cross-examination, he
appeared to disapprove expressly of the conduct engaged in by the undercover
policewoman:

 

Q[The
suspects] are noticed walking across the street in a crosswalk;  that's it. 
They're not standing  --  not seen standing where a bunch of people were
standing.  They haven't come from a place where there is any suspicion of drug
trafficking.   They're just walking across the street?

 

AIf
that's all there was, I personally wouldn't direct my operator to approach
these people, given the very limited information you're giving me.

 

                   The statistics
produced by Staff Sergeant Davies all relate to the entirety of the mall, with
no attempt to discriminate between different locations where or times when the
offences in question were committed.  To rely on these numbers in support of
the view that the police were justified in extending their operation to the
entire six-block area of the mall is fraught with peril.  Statistics are only
as good as the questions upon which they are based.  We have absolutely no idea
what questions were asked in order to produce the numbers relied on by the
Crown.  It is entirely possible that the vast majority of the drug offences
which occurred on Granville Mall took place close to the Skytrain station on
Granville Street, the acknowledged hub of drug activity on Granville Mall.  It
is equally possible that none of the offences occurred at the intersection
where the accused was intercepted.  Again, it is possible that the vast
majority of the drug offences which occurred on Granville Mall occurred on
certain days or at specific times of day -- weekends or late evenings, for
example -- and not at 6:00 p.m. on a weekday, which is when the transaction in
question here occurred.  I conclude that the statistics relied on in this case
fall far short of justifying granting to the police unfettered licence to carry
out their operation anywhere within a six-block stretch of downtown Vancouver
without restriction as to the area and the times of day to be covered.  In
short, it is not established that the police could reasonably have suspected
trafficking at the place and time where the accused was intercepted.

 

                   A second factor
relevant to determining the appropriateness of the investigation is the impact
that the investigation may have on law-abiding citizens pursuing legitimate
activities.  Here the possibility of this undercover operation's interfering
with legitimate activities was high.  As already noted, the intersection in
question is bounded by department stores, an office tower and a major hotel. 
Theatres, the Art Gallery and the Law Courts are nearby.  This factor, while
not in itself conclusive, weighs against the right of undercover police to
intercede at will.  

 

                   On the other side
of the balance must be weighed the seriousness of the criminal activity which
the police have targeted.  It is apparent that the state interest in repressing
crime may receive greater weight when the police target serious criminal
offences.  The offence here in question, while not to be condoned, cannot be
considered as serious.    In Kokesch, supra, Sopinka J. for the majority took judicial notice of the fact
that narcotics offences involving marijuana are generally regarded as less
serious than those involving ""hard"" drugs such as cocaine and
heroin.  The same might be said of offences involving hashish, the substance
involved in this case.  The amount, moreover, was small.  In short, this was
not the sort of serious drug offence which would more readily tip the balance
in favour of the state.

 

                   I turn finally to
the availability of alternative investigatory techniques for detecting the sort
of criminal activity at issue.  There were alternative ways of apprehending
drug pedlars such as the appellant.  Simple observation by undercover
operatives (as opposed to interception) is one.  I am left with some doubt as
to whether the apprehension of drug pedlars on Granville Mall requires giving
the police carte-blanche to intercept large numbers of law-abiding
citizens as these citizens visit the theatre or leave major office towers or
department stores.

 

                   I arrive then at
the conclusion that in the case at bar the individual interest in being left
alone and free to pursue one's daily business without being confronted by
undercover police operatives vastly outweighs the state interest in the repression
of crime.  It follows that the police officer in this case cannot be said to
have been acting pursuant to a bona fide inquiry.  Any other conclusion would be, in my
respectful opinion, unfitting in a society which heralds the constitutional
protection of individual liberties and places a premium on ""being left
alone"". 

 

                   I would allow the
appeal and restore the stay of proceedings.

                The
appellants were charged with conspiracy to traffic in cocaine. The indictment
stated that the appellants had conspired with each other and with two named
individuals and an unnamed person and that the conspiracy occurred between
December 5, 1983 and February 19, 1984, in Montreal, Sarnia and Kitchener.  One
of the named individuals had agreed to supply an American undercover police
officer at a place in Michigan with cocaine obtained from a supplier in
Florida.  When this transaction (Phase I) fell through in January 1984, this
individual informed the undercover officer that the two appellants could
arrange the delivery of the cocaine and set up a meeting in Sarnia for the four
of them where a new deal (Phase II) was struck for the delivery of cocaine to
Michigan.  The undercover officer accepted appellants' offer the next day but
this deal died around February 4, 1984.  The named individual, who had set up
the meeting, had a partner in Kitchener (the other named individual) who had
been very much involved in the organization of the deal.  The key locations for
the Phase II conspiracy were Kitchener and Sarnia.  Several months later
arrangements were made between the undercover officer and these two individuals
(Phase III); appellants were not involved in this third deal.

 

                At
issue on this appeal is the adequacy of the indictment.  It indicated the time
of the conspiracy, which overlapped with the period of Phase I, and Kitchener
and Sarnia where the discussions occurred and where the key agreement was
struck.  The first trial judge dismissed the case on the ground that no
conspiracy had been committed in Canada.  The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal
from that decision and ordered a new trial.  The second trial judge convicted
the appellants of the main conspiracy and held that the case would stand even
if there were separate conspiracies.  A majority of the Court of Appeal held
the conspiracy charged was the one proven at trial even though evidence had
been adduced of a second conspiracy and accordingly dismissed the appeal.  It
was argued before this Court that both the indictment and the testimony given
at trial referred to at least two separate and distinct conspiracies and that
the appellants, although parties to one conspiracy, were never parties to the
conspiracy actually charged and should, therefore, be acquitted.

 

                Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

                An
indictment is adequate if it contains sufficient details to give the accused
reasonable information with respect to the charge and to enable the accused to
identify the transaction so as to permit the adequate preparation of the
defence.  Whether an indictment is sufficient will depend on the offence
charged and the facts of the case.  Time is not required to be stated with
exact precision unless it is an essential part of the offence charged and the
accused is not misled or prejudiced by any variation in time that arises.  A
charge generally is established if the evidence discloses the commission of the
offence within the time period set out in the indictment.

 

                The
essence of the offence of conspiracy is the agreement to perform an illegal
act.  The overt acts taken to carry out that agreement are simply elements
going to prove the agreement which is the essential ingredient of the offence.

 

                A
conspiracy (Phase II) was proven here:  appellants agreed to sell cocaine to
the undercover police officer.  The evidence also established the Phase I
conspiracy.  It was not important whether the Phase III transaction is a
separate event or merely a continuation of the Phase I conspiracy.

 

                The
Crown proved the offence as charged.  Although the Phase II conspiracy may
actually have started some time after the first date in the indictment, no
prejudice was occasioned by reference to the earlier date.  More importantly,
the indictment specified the cities which pertained exclusively to the Phase II
conspiracy and so clearly indicated that the Phase II conspiracy was the sole
subject of the indictment.  Reasonable notice of the offence charged was
therefore given.  Significantly, only the appellants were charged in the
indictment.  The words ""and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario""
were superfluous and are common to almost all indictments of conspiracy that
take place in the Province of Ontario.

 

                Since
the sole issue was whether the prosecution proved the conspiracy alleged, the
fact that the evidence established more than one conspiracy was not necessarily
fatal to the prosecution.  Whether any or all of the conspiracies proven were
covered by the indictment depends on the construction of the charge.  The proof
of the Phase I conspiracy and the Phase III conspiracy were not essential to
the proof of the conspiracy involving appellants.  They were, however,
important in the narrative of events.

 

                If
the conspiracy proven includes fewer members than the number of accused or
extends over only part of the period alleged, then the conspiracy proven can
still be said to be the same conspiracy as that charged in the indictment.  In
order to find that a specific conspiracy lies within the scope of the
indictment, it is sufficient if the evidence adduced demonstrates that the
conspiracy proven included some of the accused, establishes that it occurred at
some time within the time frame alleged in the indictment, and had as its
object the type of crime alleged.

 

                The
opening address is to be taken into account in construing the indictment. 
Where the Crown stated the essence of the conspiracy relied on at the first
trial and omitted at the second trial to make any such statement, whether
consistent or inconsistent with that given at the first trial, the Crown is
bound by the position it had taken in its opening at the first trial.

//Cory
J.//

 

                The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

                Cory J. -- At issue on this appeal is
the adequacy of an indictment charging the appellants with conspiring to
traffic in cocaine.  It is argued that both the indictment and the testimony
given at trial referred to at least two separate and distinct conspiracies. 
The appellants contend that, although they were parties to one conspiracy, they
were never parties to the conspiracy that was actually charged and should,
therefore, be acquitted.

 

The
Facts

 

                The
indictment against the appellants reads as follows:

 

Between
the 5th day of December, 1983 and the 19th day of February, 1984, in the City
of Kitchener, in the Judicial District of Waterloo; in the City of Sarnia, in
the County of Lambton; and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario; and in the
City of Montreal, in the Province of Quebec; they did unlawfully conspire and
agree the one with the other or others of them, and with Brent Howard Harding
and Douglas Patrick Reidt, and with a person or persons unknown, to commit an
indictable offence, to wit:  traffic in a narcotic, to wit:  cocaine, contrary
to Section 4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act, thereby committing an indictable
offence, contrary to Section 423(1) (d) of the
Criminal Code  of Canada.

 

There
have been two trials on the indictment.  The evidence called by the Crown in
both trials was virtually the same.  In neither case was evidence called by the
defence.  The principal Crown witness was Sgt. Myny, a police officer from
Michigan.

 

Phase
I

 

                Sgt.
Myny's testimony revealed that he arrested one ""Sue Ellen"" on a
cocaine trafficking charge in December of 1983.  In exchange for a  promise of
lenient treatment, Sue Ellen agreed to introduce Myny to other cocaine
dealers.  Pursuant to her undertaking, she arranged to have Sgt. Myny meet a
person named Brent Harding at a restaurant in Windsor, Ontario, on December 14,
1983.  Harding was then residing in Kitchener.  According to Sue Ellen, he
imported cocaine from Venezuela and Colombia.  Sue Ellen had acted as a
""mule"" and carried the cocaine into Michigan to Harding who would
then smuggle it into Canada.

 

                During
the meeting of December 14, Sgt. Myny, Harding and Sue Ellen discussed the
possibility of Harding's arranging for Myny to purchase cocaine.  Two suppliers
were discussed, one Florida supplier named Williams and a ""West Palm
Beach"" supplier.  It was agreed that Harding would purchase one kilo from
the West Palm Beach supplier for $40,000 and then charge Myny $5,000 for acting
as the go-between.  At the same meeting, Harding advised that he had a partner
who was later identified as Douglas Reidt.  The appellants Douglas and Douris
were not mentioned during this meeting, they were not involved in this initial
agreement and they were not connected in any way with the Florida suppliers.

 

                It
was agreed that the cocaine would be delivered in Michigan and paid for in
American dollars.  Two days later, on December 16, Harding informed Myny that
the deal would now cost $50,000, that Harding's partner, Reidt, would make the
arrangements and that it would take a couple of days to obtain the cocaine. 
The arrangement was that Harding would contact Reidt who would in turn go to
the source.  Harding and Myny arranged to meet with Reidt in London, Ontario,
on December 20.  On that day, Harding arrived without Reidt and refused to
complete the transaction.  He gave as an excuse that he did not know Myny well
enough and suspected that he might be a police officer.

 

                On
December 22, Sue Ellen advised Myny that Harding was ready to complete the
deal.  She said that they had been testing him at the December 20 meeting. 
Further negotiations led to the final agreement that Myny would purchase two
kilos of cocaine for $100,000 U.S.  A meeting was arranged for January 6 in
Port Huron, Michigan, to finalize the details.  The transaction itself was to
be completed on January 8.  It was agreed that Myny would show his money to
Harding and Reidt at the meeting, who would then telephone the Florida
supplier.  The supplier, in turn, would then travel to Michigan and deliver the
drugs to Myny.  The proposed January 6 meeting was delayed because Harding was
having problems getting in touch with the supplier.  On January 9, Harding
informed Myny that the supplier had refused to make delivery in Michigan.  Myny
stated that he was unwilling to go down to West Palm Beach to take the
delivery.  As a result, the deal was frustrated and came to an end on January
9, 1984.

 

Phase
II

 

                Harding
phoned Myny again on January 12, 1984.  This time he informed Myny that he had
a ""new player"".  Arrangements were made to meet in Sarnia on January
14.  On that date, Harding introduced Myny to the two appellants in a Sarnia
tavern.  The wiretap evidence reveals that Harding phoned Reidt several times
between January 9 and January 12.  On January 12, Harding asked Reidt for the
number of the ""guy on Weber Street"".   Douglas lived on Weber
Street.  As was the situation in Phase I, Reidt was not the supplier, but he
was Harding's assistant in contacting the appellants and appears to have been
very much involved in the organization of the deal.

 

                At
the January 14 meeting, the appellant Douris told Myny that the transaction
would take place within four days of Myny's advising him that he was ready to
take delivery.  Once again, the sale was to be for two kilos of cocaine at
$50,000 each.  Myny made certain that the appellants would take care of
Harding's share out of the proceeds of the sale.  Douris indicated the
following procedure for taking delivery:  Douris and Myny would meet in a
Michigan hotel to complete the delivery of the cocaine and payment for it. 
Each would have the assistance of a courier.  Douglas told Myny that Harding's
previous deal fell through because he was dealing with amateurs.  He told
Harding that he had done his part and that the appellants would now deal with
Myny.

 

                The
next day, January 15, Myny accepted the offer put forward by Douglas and
Douris.  On that same day, the telephone surveillance evidence and the wiretap
evidence confirmed that Harding was meeting the appellants in Kitchener at the
time that Myny confirmed his purchase of the cocaine.  The events of the next
few days revealed that the deal was not going as planned.  Harding informed
Myny that the appellants wanted him to take delivery in Canada.  On January 31,
Harding said that Douris had told him that the drugs would be ready in three
days.  Myny requested another meeting to discuss the changes to the deal, but this
meeting never took place and, as Myny expressed it, the deal died around
February 4, 1984.

 

Phase
III

 

                Two
and a half months later, Harding re-established contact with Myny and arranged
to meet him on April 30.  At this meeting, Myny dealt with both Harding and
Reidt and an agreement was reached whereby they were to deliver three kilos of
cocaine to Myny in Michigan.  The delivery was duly made, both Harding and
Reidt were arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to the mandatory term of
life imprisonment for conspiracy to deliver an amount of cocaine exceeding 650
grams.  The appellants were not, in any way, involved in this last
transaction.  When eventually arrested, Douglas told the police that he knew of
Harding and Reidt's arrest and had been waiting to be arrested.  He did not
deny his involvement, but said that his role was not as big as that of Harding
and Reidt.

 

The
Courts Below

 

The
First Trial

 

                The
appellants' first trial came on before Salhany J.  At the conclusion of the
Crown's case, a motion for non-suit was brought on two grounds.  First, it was
said that the indictment charged multiple conspiracies, whereas the appellants
had only participated in one.  Secondly, it was argued that the evidence did
not disclose that the conspiracy had been committed in Canada.  Salhany J.
dismissed the argument pertaining to the indictment in these words:

 

... I have come to the conclusion that it is not
necessarily fatal to the prosecution, at the end of the prosecution's case,
that the evidence may have established separate conspiracies against each
accused before the court.

 

This issue is ... whether the Crown has proven the
conspiracy charged against two or more of the accused notwithstanding the
evidence of a second conspiracy.

 

In this case, the Crown, in the opening statement
indicated that he was relying upon a meeting held on January 14, 1984, between
Myny, Harding and the two accused to support the conspiracy.  It may be that
this evidence would fail to prove that Reidt was part of this conspiracy. 
That, however, does not automatically mean that the charge must fail against
the two accused.

 

In my
view, it is open for the Crown ... to rely upon the conspiracy as stated in the
opening address ... and if the evidence supports that allegation, the Crown is
entitled to prove the case against the accused....

 

                However,
Salhany J. did dismiss the Crown's case on the ground that the evidence did not
disclose that a conspiracy had been committed in Canada.

 

                The
Crown appealed this decision.  The Court of Appeal agreed with the Crown's
submissions and ordered a new trial.

 

The
Second Trial

 

                The
second trial came on before Scott Dist. Ct. J.  At the conclusion of that
trial, the appellants were convicted and sentenced to two years imprisonment. 
Although Scott Dist. Ct. J. did not make a specific finding as to whether there
was more than one conspiracy, she did hold that the main conspiracy was that
involving the appellants and if there were separate conspiracies, this was not
fatal to the Crown's case since there was clear evidence of the appellants' and
Harding's involvement with Myny and their agreement to sell two kilos of
cocaine for $100,000.

 

The
Court of Appeal (1989), 51 C.C.C. (3d) 129

 

                The
Majority

 

                The
majority of the Court of Appeal, Craig J. (ad hoc),
Robins J.A. concurring, held that the conspiracy charged was the one proven at
trial even though evidence had been adduced of a second conspiracy (Phase I) in
which the appellants were not involved.  Craig J. found that the language of
the indictment did not reveal an intention of charging more than one
conspiracy.  In his view, the evidence of the Phase I conspiracy was introduced
by the Crown to show how the conspiracy as charged originated.  He decided that
the appellants were not prejudiced or put at risk of being convicted of two
conspiracies by the introduction of this evidence.  They were not charged with
the Phase I conspiracy arising out of the Windsor and London meetings and they
were not parties to it.  As a result, the appeal was dismissed.

 

                The
Minority

 

                The
minority, Carthy J.A., held that while the appellants were clearly guilty of
conspiring with Harding on January 14, 1984, the indictment contained one count
charging a conspiracy between December 5, 1983 and February 19, 1984.  In his
view, a reasonable reading of the indictment, particularly the dates, places
and parties, indicated that the Crown charged a broad conspiracy encompassing
both Phase I and Phase II.  He held that this interpretation of the indictment
was consistent with the proceedings as they developed from the indictment
through the evidence adduced at trial and the submissions of the Crown on
appeal.  He noted that it was only in oral argument in the Court of Appeal that
the Crown advanced the argument that the conspiracy charged was limited to
Phase II and that the evidence of Phase I was merely background.  He observed
that, while the appellants knew of the existence of the Phase I conspiracy,
they did not join it but belittled it as involving amateurs.  Therefore, he
would have set aside the convictions and substituted a verdict of acquittal.

 

                It
is significant that Carthy J.A. emphasized that Reidt was in competition with
Douglas and Douris.  This was important to the conclusions he reached.  This
same point was strongly argued by counsel for the appellants on this appeal,
yet, with respect, there does not seem to be any evidence to support this
position.

 

Provisions
of the Criminal Code  Pertaining to
Indictments

 

                Sections
510 and 512 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, provide:

 

                510. (1)  Each count in
an indictment shall in general apply to a single transaction and shall contain
and is sufficient if it contains in substance a statement that the accused
committed an indictable offence therein specified.

 

                (2)  The statement referred to in
subsection (1) may be

 

(a)  in popular language without technical averments or
allegations of matters that are not essential to be proved,

 

(b)  in the words of the enactment that describes the
offence or declares the matters charged to be an indictable offence, or

 

(c)  in words that are sufficient to give to the accused
notice of the offence with which he is charged.

 

                (3)  A count shall contain sufficient
detail of the circumstances of the alleged offence to give to the accused
reasonable information with respect to the act or omission to be proved against
him and to identify the transaction referred to, but otherwise the absence or
insufficiency of details does not vitiate the count.

 

                (4)  Where an accused is charged with an
offence under section 47 or sections 49 to 53, every overt act that is to be
relied upon shall be stated in the indictment.

 

                (5)  A count may refer to any section,
subsection, paragraph or subparagraph of the enactment that creates the offence
charged, and for the purpose of determining whether a count is sufficient,
consideration shall be given to any such reference.

 

                (6)  Nothing in this Part relating to
matters that do not render a count insufficient shall be deemed to restrict or
limit the application of this section.

 

                512.  No count in an
indictment is insufficient by reason of the absence of details where, in the
opinion of the court, the count otherwise fulfils the requirements of section
510 and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, no count in an
indictment is insufficient by reason only that

 

...

 

(g) it
does not name or describe with precision any person, place or thing, ...

 

                Pursuant
to s. 516(1) of the Code, particulars of the indictment may be
ordered.  That section provides:

 

                516. (1) The court may,
where it is satisfied that it is necessary for a fair trial, order the
prosecutor to furnish particulars and, without restricting the generality of
the foregoing, may order the prosecutor to furnish particulars 

 

...

 

(g) 
further describing a person, place or thing referred to in an indictment.

 

                Thus,
the Code provides that the indictment must
contain sufficient details of the circumstances of the alleged offence to give
the accused reasonable information with respect to the act or omission to be
proved against him and to identify the transaction referred to. In cases where
confusion exists as to the indictment, a provision is made for the accused
person to obtain particulars.  The indictment can and should be expressed in
clear and simple language.

 

Indictments
Generally

 

                Certain
principles pertaining to indictments generally can be derived from the
decisions of this Court.  In R. v. Côté, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 8, the accused was
charged with failing to provide a breath sample contrary to then s. 235(2)  of
the Criminal Code .  The information omitted the words ""without
reasonable excuse"".  No objection was made to this omission and a defence
of reasonable excuse was tendered and rejected by the trial court.  De Grandpré
J., writing for six of the seven judges, stated at p. 13:

 

... the
golden rule is for the accused to be reasonably informed of the transaction
alleged against him, thus giving him the possibility of a full defence and a
fair trial.  When, as in the present case, the information recites all the
facts and relates them to a definite offence identified by the relevant section
of the Code, it is impossible for the accused to
be misled.  To hold otherwise would be to revert to the extreme technicality of
the old procedure.

 

                In R.
v. Wis Development Corp., [1984] 1 S.C.R. 485, the appellant refused to provide
particulars to the respondents who were charged with unlawfully operating a
commercial air service.  The respondents, therefore, prior to plea, made an
application to quash the information.  Lamer J., as he then was, writing for
the Court, held that the information was defective because the words
""operation of a ""commercial air service"""" could relate to
many activities or usages of aircraft in Canada.  At page 493 he stated:

 

When
accused, the citizen shall then be treated fairly.  This requires that he must
be able clearly to identify what he is alleged to have done wrong so that he
may prepare his case adequately....

 

                The
Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Ryan (1985), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 1, considered
whether precise time and location needed to be specified in a charge of
impaired driving or driving with a blood alcohol reading over the prescribed
limit.  It was argued that in light of Wis,
supra, the accused was entitled to a detailed description of
time and place of the offence.  The Court of Appeal reasoned that the rationale
of Wis was based not on the failure to set out the time or
location of the offence, but rather on the failure to identify the particular
act which was alleged to have constituted the offence.  At page 6 the following
was stated:

 

                The
test continues to be whether the information contains sufficient detail to give
to the accused reasonable information with respect to the charge and
to identify the transaction referred to therein.  In our opinion, the kind
of information that will be necessary to satisfy this test will vary depending
on the nature of the offence charged....  What particularity will be needed
with respect to a given charge will ""depend on the circumstances"".... 
[Emphasis added.]

 

The same
principles were considered and applied in Re Regina and
R.I.C. (1986), 32 C.C.C. (3d) 399 (Ont. C.A.).  At page 403,
Krever J.A. stated:

 

                That decision [R. v.
Ryan] seems to me to make it clear that nothing in the WIS case
casts doubt on the correctness of this general statement in Salhany, Canadian
Criminal Procedure, 4th ed. (1984), p. 214:

 

                Whether or not the charge contains
sufficient details to give the accused reasonable information and to identify
the transaction referred to will depend upon the facts of each case and the
nature of the charge.

 

                With
that proposition in mind, I turn to an examination of the facts of this case
and the nature of the charge. Especially important is the nature of the charge
-- an extended (six-month) course of conduct of sexually assaulting a
nine-year-old child.  It is, therefore, a kind of case in which, because of the
age of the alleged victim, full particularity with respect to, for example,
dates, is likely impossible and to require it would make prevention of a
serious social problem exceedingly difficult. ...  The accused sought ...
particulars of the information....  Before making the request for particulars,
he had pleaded to the charge.  He had, by that time been permitted to read the
Crown's brief.  Crown counsel, in response ... volunteered that he was relying
on 10 separate incidents which had occurred between May 31, 1984, and December
15, 1984....  [Emphasis added.]

 

                From
these cases it can be seen that an indictment is adequate if it contains
sufficient details to give the accused reasonable information with respect to
the charge and to enable the accused to identify the transaction so as to
permit the adequate preparation of the defence.  Whether an indictment is
sufficient will depend on the offence charged and the facts of the case.  Time
is not required to be stated with exact precision unless it is an essential
part of the offence charged and the accused is not misled or prejudiced by any
variation in time that arises.

 

                As
well, it can generally be said that a charge has been established if the
evidence discloses the commission of the offence within the time period set out
in the indictment.  See, for example, Container
Materials Ltd. v. The King, [1942] S.C.R. 147, at p. 159 and R.
v. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 1, at p. 52, aff'd (1981), 62
C.C.C. (2d) 118 (Ont. C.A.).  In the Hoffmann case
the accused was charged with selling articles at unreasonably low prices
contrary to the Combines Investigation Act.  At pages 52-53,
Linden J. stated:

 

I do not
think the defence is correct in arguing that the Crown must prove in this case
that the accused engaged in a policy of selling at unreasonably low prices
continuously, throughout the entire period January 1, 1968 to November 30,
1974.  The indictment says that the offence was committed
""between"" those dates, not that it continued during the entire
period.  It is sufficient, I hold, to prove that the offence was committed at
some point within the time frame alleged.  I find that the Crown has
accomplished this when it proved that the policy was engaged in from June 25,
1970 to June 30, 1971, a period which is clearly within the dates alleged. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

                The
requirements that an information must meet have been set forth with great
clarity by Wilson J. in R. v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R.
30, at pp. 44-45,  in this way:

 

                It
is apparent from these cases that what constitutes reasonable or adequate
information with respect to the act or omission to be proven against the
accused will of necessity vary from case to case.  The factual matters which
underlie some offences permit greater descriptive precision than in the case of
other offences.  Accordingly, a significant factor in any assessment of the reasonableness
of the information furnished is the nature and legal character of the offence
charged.  It is also apparent, however, that in general an information or
indictment will not be quashed just because the exact time of the offence is
not specified.  Rather, the matter will continue on to trial on the merits. 
While it is obviously important to provide an accused with sufficient
information to enable him or her to identify the transaction and prepare a
defence, particularity as to the exact time of the alleged offence is not in
the usual course necessary for this purpose.  It goes without saying, of
course, that there may be cases where it is.

 

Ultimately
it will have to be determined if the indictment in the case under consideration
meets these requirements.

 

Indictments
as They Pertain to the Offence of Conspiracy

 

                The
offence of conspiracy has long been recognized in the criminal law.  It can
often play a valid and significant role in the prosecution of those seeking to
traffic in illicit drugs.  While the offence of conspiracy is inherently
difficult to frame, the indictment must be set forth with such reasonable
precision as to inform the accused of the fundamental nature of the conspiracy
charged.

 

                The
essence of the offence of conspiracy is the agreement to perform an illegal act
or to achieve a result by illegal means.  In this case, those accused of the
conspiracy must be found to have agreed to traffic in cocaine.  How that
agreement is to be carried out, that is to say, the steps taken in furtherance
of the agreement (the overt acts) are simply elements going to the proof of the
essential ingredient of the offence, namely, the agreement.  This was the
principle which was enunciated by Dickson J., as he then was, in R.
v. Cotroni, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 256.

 

                If
that principle is borne in mind, it is perhaps easier to consider the problems
of indictments in conspiracy cases.  They may arise in either of two ways. 
First, a conspiracy count may charge the accused with two or more conspiracies;
secondly, the count may charge only one conspiracy, but proof at trial may
demonstrate that there was more than one conspiracy.  A count in an indictment
which charges the accused with two or more conspiracies gives rise to issues of
duplicity.  A count which charges just one conspiracy where the proof at trial
reveals more than one conspiracy raises the question of whether the Crown has
proven the conspiracy charged against the accused despite the evidence of a
second conspiracy.

 

                The
issue was put forward in this way by Dickson J. in Cotroni,
supra, at p. 285:

 

                A
distinction must be drawn between a conspiracy count which charges the accused
with two or more conspiracies, and a count which charges one conspiracy only
but is supported by proof during trial of more than one conspiracy.  The former
gives rise to questions of duplicity.  The latter raises the question of
whether the Crown has proven the conspiracy charged against two or more of the
accused notwithstanding evidence of a second conspiracy. 

 

He
continued at pp. 286-87:

 

                Where several conspiracies are shown to
have been committed, the problem arises of determining which one of these
conspiracies is that envisaged by the charge.

 

                Whether
any or all of the conspiracies that have been proven to have been committed are
covered by the indictment depends on the construction of the charge.

 

                In R.
v. Paterson, Ackworth and Kovach (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 137 (Ont.
C.A.), aff'd sub nom. R. v. Ackworth, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 291, Martin J.A.
summarized some basic principles that are applicable to a consideration of
indictments in conspiracy cases which may usefully be considered in this case. 
He stated at pp. 143-44:

 

                The prosecution must prove the
conspiracy alleged.  Where the count alleges that the accused conspired
together for a common purpose but the prosecution proves only that some of
those accused had conspired with one of their number for their own purposes, no
common purpose such as that alleged has been established....

 

                Where the evidence establishes the
conspiracy alleged against two or more accused (or against one accused and an
unknown person where the indictment alleges that the accused conspired together
and with persons unknown), it is immaterial that the evidence also discloses
another and wider conspiracy to which the accused or some of them were also
parties:  R. v. Greenfield et al.,
supra, at p. 857; R. v. Coughlan and Young,
supra, at p. 35.

 

...

 

Although other conspirators, in addition to Daley and
Doroshenko, are named in count 1, it is elementary that proof of the
participation of all the named conspirators is not essential and does not
result in proof of a different agreement to that charged.

 

                The present case is the converse of R.
v. Griffiths et al., supra, and R. v. Longworth
et al., supra.  In those cases the conspiracy
charged in the indictment was a wider, more serious and fundamentally different
conspiracy than the one proved.

 

                In the present case, the evidence
established and the judge found that the respondents were participants in a
conspiracy to traffic in two illicit drugs in which Daley and Doroshenko were
the central figures.  Each count in the indictment charged a conspiracy to traffic
in one of the illicit drugs only.  The issue is whether proof of the
respondents' participation in a conspiracy to traffic in both drugs, in which
Daley and Doroshenko were the central figures, necessarily also proved their
participation in a conspiracy with Daley and Doroshenko to traffic in one of
the drugs as charged in each count.

 

                In R.
v. Griffiths et al., supra, and R. v. Longworth
et al., supra, the evidence failed to prove that
the accused were participants in the general conspiracy alleged and it would be
grossly unfair and improper to convict them of a different conspiracy than that
with which they were charged.  In the present case, the evidence proved more
than what was alleged in each count; it proved that the respondents were
participants in a conspiracy to traffic in both drugs, not just the ones
specified in the count.  The respondents suffered no prejudice and cannot
complain because the Crown limited the conspiracy charged in each count to
conspiracy to traffic in only one of the drugs.

 

Application
of the Foregoing Principles to the Case at Bar

 

                In
the case at bar, there is no question that a conspiracy or agreement was
proven, namely, that Douglas and Douris conspired or agreed, at least with
Harding and Myny, to sell two kilos of cocaine to Myny for $100,000 U.S.  The
evidence also established the Phase I conspiracy involving Harding, Reidt and
an unknown Florida supplier to sell the same amount of cocaine to Myny for the
same price.  Lastly, there was a conspiracy proven whereby Harding and Reidt
agreed to sell and then sold three kilos of cocaine to Myny in Michigan in
April, some two months after the date of the conspiracy alleged in the
indictment.  Whether this Phase III  transaction is a separate event or merely
a continuation of the Phase I conspiracy, is not important for our purposes.

 

                Does
the indictment charge only the Phase II conspiracy or does it, as the
appellants argue, charge a broader conspiracy covering both Phase I and Phase
II?  If the appellants are correct, the Crown has failed to prove the offence
charged since the appellants had no involvement whatsoever in the Phase I
conspiracy.

 

                In
my view, the Crown did prove the offence as charged.  First, with regard to the
time, the indictment refers to a relatively short period between December 5,
1983 and February 19, 1984.  It should be observed that the date of December 5
precedes both the Phase I conspiracy and the Phase II conspiracy.  February 19
was the time the Phase II conspiracy, in the words of Sgt. Myny, ""had
died"".  The December 5 date may be an indication of when Sgt. Myny first
spoke to Sue Ellen and learned that she would reveal to him the names of
cocaine dealers.  He referred to this conversation as occurring early in
December.  Although, ideally, the indictment might have referred only to the
time from the January 11 or 12 to February 19, it is difficult to see what
prejudice was occasioned by reference to the earlier date.  

 

                Most
importantly, the indictment specified the cities which pertained exclusively to
the Phase II conspiracy.  That is to say, it referred specifically to the
places where the discussions occurred, namely, Sarnia and Kitchener.  It will
be remembered that the Phase I conspiracy involved negotiations and an eventual
agreement that took place in the cities of Windsor and London.  With respect to
the Phase II conspiracy, it was the City of Sarnia where the key agreement was
made.  Douglas and Harding resided in Kitchener and Douris in Montreal.  To my
mind, there could not be a clearer indication that the indictment was referring
only to the Phase II conspiracy which was clearly proven in this case.  The reference
to Sarnia and Kitchener indicated to the appellants that the Phase II
conspiracy was the sole subject of the indictment.  In other words, it gave
them reasonable notice of the offence charged.  As well, it is not without some
significance that only Douglas and Douris were charged in the indictment.

 

                Much
was made of the fact that the indictment went on to say ""and elsewhere in
the Province of Ontario"".  Counsel for the Crown submitted, and research
bears him out, that ""these words, superfluous as they may be, are common
to almost all indictments of conspiracy that take place in the Province of
Ontario.""  These unnecessary and surplus words cannot be said to
constitute a basis for finding that the indictment did not reasonably disclose
the offence charged.  This is particularly so when the key locations of Sarnia
and Kitchener, which were crucial to the Phase II conspiracy, were specifically
set out and no reference was made to Windsor and London, where the Phase I
conspiracy took place.  Again, the reference to Sarnia and Kitchener clearly
indicates that the conspiracy charged was the Phase II conspiracy.  The
reference to elsewhere in Ontario does not make this any less clear.

 

                Since
the sole issue in this case is to determine whether the prosecution proved the
conspiracy alleged, the fact that the evidence established more than one
conspiracy is not necessarily fatal to the prosecution.  In
Cotroni, supra, it was recognized that whether any
or all of the conspiracies that had been proven to have been committed were
covered by the indictment depended on the construction of the charge.  The
proof of the Phase I conspiracy involving Harding and Reidt and the Phase III
agreement in April, again involving Harding and Reidt, were not essential to
the proof of the conspiracy involving Douglas and Douris.  Nevertheless, Phase
I was important in the narrative of events.  It established the circumstances
under which Myny met Sue Ellen and how the undercover operation began.  It also
revealed that Myny was known to be in the market for a very significant
quantity of cocaine and the price he was willing to pay.  At the Sarnia
meeting, Douglas and Douris confirmed that they were aware of the quantity and
price to be paid for the cocaine.  The Phase III transaction was, as well,
important for the narrative of the case.  The evidence of Phase III was
necessary to explain the reaction of Douglas when he was arrested, specifically
that he was aware of what had happened to Harding and his volunteered statement
that he played a lesser role than Harding.

 

 

                The
reasons of the minority in the Court of Appeal stressed that Reidt was not
involved in the Phase II conspiracy, but was in fact a competitor of the
appellants.  This same factor was stressed by counsel for the appellants.  I
cannot find any evidence that Reidt was, or could in any way be considered to
be, a competitor of Douglas and Douris.  

                Rather,
the evidence reveals that Reidt was involved in the arrangements Harding made
with Douglas and Douris.  The testimony of Sgt. Myny clearly establishes that
Reidt was Harding's partner during Phase I.  More importantly, contrary to the
assertions of counsel for the appellants, Reidt was clearly involved in the
Phase II conspiracy.  For example, Reidt phoned Harding on January 9 saying: 
""I'll see you [Harding] in a bit"".  On January 11, the day before
Harding contacted Myny to set up a meeting with a ""new player"", there
were three telephone calls between Harding and Reidt.  In the first, Harding
asked Reidt if he got ""a hold of what's his name"".  In the second,
Reidt phoned Harding to say that, ""He phoned"".  In the third, Harding
phoned Reidt asking for the number of ""the guy over on Weber
Street"".  The evidence established that Douglas lived on Weber Street. 
Reidt said that ""the guy talked to him last night"".  Further, less
than two minutes after Harding had spoken by telephone to Myny on January 12,
1984, advising Myny that he had ""new players"" (the appellants) and
setting up the January 14 meeting in Sarnia, Harding called Reidt.  It would
therefore seem that Reidt assisted Harding in making contact with Douglas.

 

 

                The
evidence clearly confirms that Reidt was Harding's partner and not a supplier. 
He was his partner in what the drug trade refers to as ""making the
connect"" or ""making the contact"" between the buyer and the
seller or supplier.  It is thus apparent that there is absolutely no evidence
that Reidt and the appellants were competitors.  From the testimony of Myny, it
would appear that in Phase I Myny was the buyer, the ""connect"" was
Harding and Reidt and the seller was to be a Florida supplier.  In Phase II,
Myny was once again the buyer, Harding and Reidt were again the
""connect"" and the supplier or seller was to be the appellants.

 

                There
is no question that Reidt was, at least to some extent, implicated in the Phase
II conspiracy.  Clearly, it is not incumbent upon the Crown to prove the
involvement of every member alleged to be part of the conspiracy.  Even if he
were not involved, the conspiracy charged was proved.  If the conspiracy proven
includes fewer members than the number of accused or extends over only part of
the period alleged, then the conspiracy proven can still be said to be the same
conspiracy as that charged in the indictment.  In order to find that a specific
conspiracy lies within the scope of the indictment, it is sufficient if the
evidence adduced  demonstrates that the conspiracy proven included some of the
accused, establishes that it occurred at some time within the time frame
alleged in the indictment, and had as its object the type of crime alleged. 
This point was very well made by Groberman in the article ""The Multiple
Conspiracies Problem in Canada"" (1982), 40 U.T. Fac. L.
Rev. 1, at pp. 9-10:

 

Unless
the indictment is unusually precise, it will normally merely specify the type
of offence that was the subject of the agreement, and the persons alleged to
have been involved, along with a period of time over which the conspiracy is
alleged to have occurred.  Even if the conspiracy proven includes fewer members
than the number of accused charged, or extends over only part of the period
alleged, the conspiracy charged can be said to be the same conspiracy as that
proven.  Thus, in order for a specific conspiracy to lie within the scope of
the indictment, it is only necessary for it to have included some of the
accused, occurred at some time within the span alleged in the indictment, and
had as its object the type of crime alleged.

 

It
follows that the conspiracy charged could be established even without proof
that the conspiracy involved Reidt.  It was sufficient for the Crown to prove
that Harding, Douglas and Douris agreed, or conspired to traffic in cocaine
during the time period alleged.

 

                There
is another factor which is appropriate to take into account.  This Court has
held that the opening address is a factor to be taken into account in
construing the indictment; Cotroni, supra, per Dickson
J. at pp. 285-86.  In its opening address at the first trial, the Crown stated
that it was relying on the January 14 meeting.  It is true that the new trial
constituted a new beginning.  Yet, in this case, the Crown made a very short
opening statement at the second trial.  The opening referred to the first trial
and that, as a result of the decision of the Court of Appeal, the
jurisdictional argument was no longer available to the defence.  Reference was
made to the section of the Criminal Code  relied upon and
the two principal witnesses to be called.  The greatest portion of the very
brief opening was taken up with a request for defence counsel to make known
their position with regard to the wiretap evidence.  No details were given and,
particularly, no reference was made to the meeting in Sarnia.

 

                In
these circumstances, where the Crown stated the essence of the conspiracy
relied on at the first trial and omitted to make any such statement, whether
consistent or inconsistent with that given at the first trial, at the second
trial the Crown is bound by the position it had taken in its opening at the
first trial.  This position, as summarized by Salhany J. in his reasons, was
that the Crown was relying on the January 14 Sarnia meeting to establish the
conspiracy.  The appellants were entitled to rely upon the position thus
adopted by the Crown.  It would have been unfair and unacceptable for the
Crown, without special notice to the defence, to have changed its position in
this regard.  That opening in which the Crown stated it was relying upon the
Sarnia meeting of January 14 clearly indicated that the conspiracy the Crown
sought to establish was that entered into by the appellants with Harding and
Myny; that is to say, the Phase II conspiracy.

 

                In
summary, the wording of the indictment, the opening at the first trial and the
evidence adduced at both trials reveal that the Crown proved the conspiracy
charged: the Phase II conspiracy.  The time frame indicated in the indictment
is not unreasonable, especially when one considers when Myny commenced the undercover
operation.  The places specifically referred to in it can only refer to the
Phase II conspiracy.  The reference made to ""elsewhere in the Province of
Ontario"" does not open up the indictment to an interpretation that the
appellants were co-conspirators in the Phase I conspiracy.

 

                The
evidence of Phase I and Phase III adduced at both trials does not mean that the
Crown was charging a conspiracy broader than Phase II.  Such evidence was
important as background to the conspiracy actually charged.  The evidence
clearly established that Reidt assisted Harding during Phase II and was not the
appellants' competitor.  As well, the opening statement at the first trial,
which in these circumstances the appellants are entitled to rely on, indicated
that the Crown was relying heavily on the January 14 Sarnia meeting.  Lastly,
the evidence called at the second trial which closely followed that called at
the first trial, clearly established that the appellants conspired to traffic
in cocaine.

 

                The
Crown has proven the conspiracy charged and that the appellants were adequately
informed of the charge against them.  Although it is not in any way necessary
to the decision, I would note that the appellants did not at any time request
particulars of the indictment.

 

                In
my view, the decision in Cotroni, supra,
supports this conclusion.  It will be remembered that in that case four people,
Swartz, Papalia, Cotroni and Violi were charged with conspiring with each
other, in the County of York and elsewhere in Ontario, to have possession of
$300,000, knowing it was obtained by the commission in Canada of the indictable
offence of extortion.  At trial in Ontario, two conspiracies were proven: the
first involved Swartz and Papalia, the second Cotroni and Violi.  It was held that,
although the language of the indictment might well be broad enough to include
both conspiracies, the second conspiracy took place only in Quebec and nothing
was done in furtherance of it within Ontario.  As a result, it was found that
Ontario had no jurisdiction in respect to it and, therefore, it had to be
inferred that it was not the conspiracy referred to in the indictment.

 

                Nonetheless,
it was found that Papalia and Swartz conspired as charged and the conviction
against Papalia was upheld.  Thus, even though two conspiracies were proven at
trial, it was found that the conspiracy charged against Swartz and Papalia was
proven.  So too, in the case at bar the conspiracy charged against the
appellants was proven, although two conspiracies were proven at the trial.

 

Conclusion

 

                In
the result, I would dismiss the appeal.

//Sopinka J.//

 

                The following are the
reasons for the Order delivered by

 

                Sopinka
J. -- This is an
application by the Crown for an order of reversal of judgment pursuant to
s. 70  of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. S‑26 .  The
Crown has filed a consent to a ""reversal of the Judgment, to the extent that
a new trial be ordered"".

 

The Facts

 

                The appellant was
charged with eight counts relating to various offences under the
Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46  (then R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34)
and was convicted at trial on all counts except three and eight.  The Nova
Scotia Court of Appeal allowed the appeal in part and directed an acquittal on
count one and a new trial on counts six and seven.  The appellant applied for
leave to appeal to this Court with respect to counts two, four and five on
several grounds.  Leave was granted on the following ground only:

 

                That, subsequent to
the date of the trial of this matter in the Nova Scotia Supreme Court and the
date of the appeal of this matter before the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, new
evidence has surfaced of such a nature that, had it been known at trial, it would
have affected the result of the trial.

 

Section 70 

 

                A question arises at
the threshold of this application as to whether, in view of the detailed
provisions of the Code relating to the right to appeal to this Court and the powers of this
Court on a criminal appeal, s. 70  applies to this proceeding.  I have
considered the submissions of counsel and conclude that the provisions of the
Supreme Court Act 
apply to a criminal appeal unless excluded by the language of the Code or by 

the terms employed in our Act.  This
is the reason, for example, that it was necessary to enact s. 40(3)  of the
Supreme Court Act . 
See R. v. Gardiner, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368.

 

                The next question is
whether the section can be used to force a consent order on an unwilling
appellant.  Strange as it may seem at first blush, the appellant resists the
application to order a new trial.  In my opinion, the section does not require
the consent of the appellant but rather contemplates a situation in which the
respondent consents to a disposition that gives the appellant all the relief
that would be available if complete success were achieved on the appeal.

 

Disposition

 

                In this appeal, if the
appellant were completely successful, the convictions on counts two, four and
five would be quashed and the appellant acquitted.  In R.
v. Stolar, [1988] 1
S.C.R. 480, McIntyre J. dealt with the powers of a court of appeal in
connection with an application to adduce fresh evidence.  At page 488 he
stated:  ""I also agree that a new trial will not be required in every
case, for there will be cases where the new evidence may be so conclusive that
the Court of Appeal can determine the proceedings on its own.""

 

                Whatever the chances
are in this case that this will be the outcome for the appellant, he cannot be
deprived of them by a unilateral consent to judgment by the respondent.  The
application is therefore dismissed.

 

                Motion dismissed.

    The
accused was charged with first degree murder.  At trial, he conceded killing
the victim but raised the defence of insanity pursuant to s. 16  of the Criminal
Code .  Uncontradicted evidence was given indicating that the
accused suffered from a severe psychosis.  He believed at the time of the
murder that he was acting on God's orders to kill Satan.  The accused knew that
murder was a crime but believed, nevertheless, that the act was necessary in
order to fulfill his Divine mission.  The trial judge instructed the jury to
consider the insanity defence, stating that the accused should not be convicted
if he lacked the capacity, because of disease of the mind, to appreciate the
nature or quality of his act or to know that the act was legally wrong.  The
jury rejected the insanity defence and convicted the accused.  The Court of
Appeal set aside the accused's conviction and substituted a verdict of not
guilty by reason of insanity.  The Court held that the ""appreciation of
the quality of an act"" for the purposes of the first branch of
s. 16(2)  involves an appreciation of the moral wrongfulness of the act. 
The Court further held that, in view of s. 7  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , s. 16  must be interpreted in a
sufficient broad manner in order to offer a defence to the accused in this
case.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

    Per Lamer
C.J. and Wilson, La Forest, Sopinka and Cory JJ.:  In taking into account the
accused's inability to know the moral wrongfulness of the act under the first
branch of the test under s. 16(2) of the Code, that
is, as part of appreciating the ""nature or quality"" of the act, the
Court of Appeal interpreted s. 16(2)  in a manner that clearly contradicted
prior judgments of this Court.  The first branch of the s. 16(2)  test only
protects an accused who, because of a disease of the mind, was incapable of
appreciating the physical consequences of his act.  The Court of Appeal erred
also in using s. 7  of the Charter  to modify the
established interpretation of this statutory provision.  However, the accused's
acquittal is justified under the second branch of s. 16(2) .  It was
established at trial and accepted by the Court of Appeal that the accused
suffered from a disease of the mind to the extent that he was rendered
incapable of knowing that the act was morally wrong in these circumstances. 
Given that the majority judgment of this Court in Chaulk
redefined the word ""wrong"" in s. 16(2)  to mean ""morally
wrong"" rather than ""legally wrong"", the accused should have been
acquitted by reason of insanity.

 

    Although
basing its decision on incorrect reasons, the Court of Appeal properly
exercised its discretion under s. 686(1)(d) of the Code.  If
the jury had been properly directed in accordance with Chaulk, this
Court is satisfied that a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity would
have resulted.

 

    Per
L'Heureux‑Dubé and McLachlin JJ.:  The Court of Appeal erred in its
interpretation of the first branch of s. 16(2) .  The first branch refers
only to an incapacity to appreciate the physical character of and the physical
consequences which flow from an act or omission.  Further, while the Code
provisions must be interpreted in accordance with Charter  values,
the Court of Appeal erred in using s. 7  of the Charter  to
effectively re‑interpret the first branch of s. 16(2)  in order to
achieve a result which is inconsistent with previous decisions of this Court.

 

    The
accused's claim of incapacity in this case is only relevant to the second
branch of s. 16(2)  ‑‑ incapacity to know that an act or
omission is wrong.  For the reasons given by McLachlin J. in Chaulk, the
inquiry for the second branch is whether the accused is incapable of knowing
that an act or omission is wrong, in the sense of an act or omission that he or
she ought not to do.  Following the trial judge's instructions, the jury
rejected the claim of insanity under both branches of s. 16(2) .  The jury
determined that the accused had the capacity to know that his act was one which
he ought not to do in law.  The jury's verdict, therefore, should not be
disturbed. It follows that this appeal would have been allowed but, given the
majority judgment of this Court in Chaulk, which is binding,
it must be dismissed.

//Lamer C.J.//

 

    The
judgment of Lamer C.J. and Wilson, La Forest and Cory JJ. was delivered by

 

    Lamer C.J. --
The present appeal is concerned with the interpretation of s. 16(2) of the
insanity provisions contained in the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  More specifically, this Court has been asked to
consider whether it is necessary for an accused, in order to be capable of
""appreciating the nature or quality of an act or omission"" for the
purposes of s. 16(2) , to have the capacity to understand the moral
wrongfulness of the act.  This appeal also raises the issue of whether the
Court of Appeal erred in overturning the conviction at trial and finding the respondent
not guilty by reason of insanity pursuant to s. 686(1) (d)
(formerly s. 613(1) (d)).

 

Facts

 

    On
April 21, 1984, Michel Fortin was found dead in his home, the victim of two gun‑shot
wounds in the head.  The respondent was arrested the following day and questioned
by police with respect to the incident.  He had been charged and convicted,
approximately three years earlier, of assaulting the victim.  The respondent
refused to speak to any police officers and was released several days later.

 

    Almost
four months later, in response to renewed questioning by the police, the
respondent confessed to having caused the death of Mr. Fortin.  He
admitted that he had planned the event:  he had acquired a firearm for this
purpose some time earlier and had entered the home of the victim on the day in
question with the weapon concealed on his person. After firing two shots at the
victim's head, he left the premises, threw the firearm in a river and returned
to his own home.

 

    The
respondent was convicted of first degree murder by a jury in the Superior Court
of Quebec.  The respondent conceded that he had committed the physical act of
killing Mr. Fortin, but argued that he should be found not guilty by
reason of insanity pursuant to s. 16  of the Criminal Code . 
Uncontradicted evidence was given at trial that the respondent suffered from a
severe psychosis that made him believe that he was God and had a mission to
destroy all forces of evil on Earth.  He suffered from the further delusion
that Mr. Fortin was ""Satan"" and that he had to kill him in order
to rid the Earth effectively of all evil forces.  The respondent knew that
murder was a crime and that he would in all likelihood be arrested for this
act, but he believed nevertheless that the act was necessary in order to
fulfill his Divine mission.  The trial judge instructed the jury to consider
the insanity defence, stating that the respondent should not be convicted if he
lacked the capacity, because of disease of the mind, to appreciate the nature
or quality of his act or to know that the act was legally wrong.

 

    The
Court of Appeal of Quebec unanimously set aside the respondent's conviction and
substituted a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity: (1988), 48 C.C.C.
(3d) 552, 26 Q.A.C. 194 (hereinafter cited to C.C.C.).

 

Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

Criminal
Code 

 

    16. (1)  No person shall be convicted of
an offence in respect of an act or omission on his part while that person was
insane.

 

    (2)  For the purposes of this section, a person is
insane when the person is in a state of natural imbecility or has disease of
the mind to an extent that renders the person incapable of appreciating the
nature and quality of an act or omission or of knowing that an act or omission
is wrong.

 

    (3)  A person who has specific delusions, but is in
other respects sane, shall not be acquitted on the ground of insanity unless
the delusions caused that person to believe in the existence of a state of
things that, if it existed, would have justified or excused the act or omission
of that person.

 

    (4)  Every one shall, until the contrary is proved,
be presumed to be and to have been sane.

 

    686. (1)  On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit, on
account of insanity, to stand trial, or against a special verdict of not guilty
on account of insanity, the court of appeal

(d) may
set aside a conviction and find the appellant not guilty on account of insanity
and order the appellant to be kept in safe custody to await the pleasure of the
lieutenant governor where it is of the opinion that, although the appellant
committed the act or made the omission charged against him, he was insane at
the time the act was committed or the omission was made, so that he was not
criminally responsible for his conduct.

Lower
Court Judgments

 

Quebec
Superior Court

 

    The
respondent was tried before Ducros J., sitting with a jury, in the Superior
Court.  He was convicted of first degree murder.  The only defence raised at
trial was insanity and this defence was rejected by the jury.

 

Quebec
Court of Appeal (per Beauregard, Nichols and Tourigny JJ.A.)

 

    The
respondent appealed his conviction to the Quebec Court of Appeal on the grounds
that the trial judge erred in law in refusing to admit into evidence a
psychiatric report, that ""inflammatory"" statements by Crown counsel
caused irreparable prejudice to the respondent and to his right to make a full
defence, that the trial judge failed to direct the jury adequately on
s. 16  as well as on certain ancillary matters, and that the verdict
rendered by the jury was unreasonable in light of the evidence.

 

    The
Court agreed that the respondent suffered from a disease of the mind at the
time he committed the offence.  The principal question, therefore, was whether
the mental disorder rendered him incapable of appreciating the nature or
quality of his act or of knowing that the act was wrong.

 

    Beauregard
J.A. did not dispute the fact that the respondent was aware that he was
committing murder and that murder was illegal. These facts, however, did not in
his view preclude the respondent from invoking s. 16  since he believed at
the time that he was acting on God's orders to kill Satan.  The trial judge's
direction to the jury did not explain adequately that the respondent should be
acquitted if it was believed that he suffered from such a delusion.  Citing an
excerpt from a lecture given by Martin J.A. of the Court of Appeal of Ontario,
Beauregard J.A. believed that, given the delusion from which he suffered, the
respondent could not have appreciated the nature and quality of the act.  In
his lecture, Martin J.A made the following comments with respect to the
consequences that would flow from defining ""wrong"" in s. 16(2) 
to mean ""legally wrong"" rather than ""morally wrong"":

 

    In the following example given by Stephen it might
perhaps make a difference [History of the Criminal Law of England (1883),
Vol. II, p. 149]:

 

    A kills B, knowing that he is killing B, and knowing
that it is illegal to kill B, but under an insane delusion that the salvation
of the human race will be obtained by his execution for the murder of B, and
that God has commanded him (A) to produce that result by these means.  A's act
is a crime if the word ""wrong"" means illegal.  It is not a crime if
the word ""wrong"" means morally wrong.

 

It would
appear likely, however, that a jury, if it was satisfied that the accused was
acting under a delusion such as that described, would probably conclude that he
was incapable of ""appreciating"" the nature and quality of the act as
that word has been interpreted by the Canadian courts.

 

(G. A. Martin, ""Mental Disorder and Criminal Law
Responsibility in Canadian Law"", in S. J. Hucker, C. D. Webster and M. H.
Ben‑Aron, eds., Member Disorder and Criminal Responsibility (1981),
15, at p. 21.)

 

Beauregard
J.A. reasoned from the concluding remarks of this statement that s. 16(2) 
must not be interpreted in such a restrictive manner as to convict an accused
such as the person described by Martin J.A. and, therefore, the respondent. 
Moreover, such an interpretation would contravene s. 7  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  (at p. 563):

 

    [TRANSLATION] If s. 7 of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  prevents Parliament from permitting a
person to be stigmatized by a conviction for murder other than under a legal
provision which is in conformity with the principles of fundamental justice,
and if one must necessarily interpret laws in conformity with our Constitution,
I am of the opinion that s. 16  must be interpreted in a sufficiently broad
manner in order to offer a defence to the appellant in the present case.

 

    Landry
who knew that he was killing Fortin and who knew that it was unlawful, is
guilty of murder despite his mental disorder.  But, even if Landry knew the
nature and the consequences of his act and even if he knew that it was
unlawful, he was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of his act
if, at that moment, he thought that he was God and that Fortin was Satan.  This
is an error in judgment arising from the confusion between Landry and God, and
Fortin and Satan.

 

    Nichols
J.A. concurred in the conclusions reached by Beauregard J.A.  He noted that
there is no doubt, as a result of the judgments of this Court in Schwartz
v. The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 673, and Cooper v. The Queen, [1980]
1 S.C.R. 1149, that the word ""wrong"" as used in the second branch of
s. 16(2)  means ""legally wrong"".  He held, however, that the
appreciation of the quality of an act for the purposes of the first branch of
s. 16(2)  involves an appreciation of the moral wrongfulness of the act (at
pp. 564-65):

 

    [TRANSLATION]  When one says that an act is wrong,
one indubitably refers to the quality of the act.

 

                                                                        . . .

 

    When one says that the word ""wrong"" must
be interpreted as meaning legally wrong, one must then ask whether the law
makes the quality of the act, the determinative criterium.

 

    To ask the question is to answer it.  It suffices to
read s. 16(2)  in its entirety without attempting to compartmentalize each of
the words of the section as if they should necessarily have different
meanings.  The word ""wrong"" must be read having regard to the quality
of the act.

 

    In
the first part of s. 16(2) , the disease of the mind, in order to justify a
defence of insanity, must be one which, on a balance of probabilities, renders
the accused incapable of appreciating -- among others --
the quality of his act.  In a second part of the section, the disease of the
mind may also justify a defence of insanity if it renders the accused incapable
of knowing that his act is wrong. [Emphasis in original.]

 

    In
light of the evidence at trial, the Court of Appeal overturned the conviction
and entered a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity under former
s. 613(1) (d) of the Criminal Code .

 

    The
appellant now appeals the decision of the Court of Appeal to this Court.

 

Issues

 

    The
appellant frames the issues as follows:

 

[TRANSLATION]

1.Did the Court of Appeal of Quebec err in law in
applying the word ""wrong"" in the sense of ""morally wrong""
to the notion of the ""quality of the act"" in s. 16(2)  of the Criminal
Code ?

 

2.Did the Court of Appeal of Quebec err in law in
relying on s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  to
expand the insanity defence to include situations where the ""disease of
the mind"" affects the motive or moral justification of an accused in
committing a criminal act?

 

3.Did
the Court of Appeal of Quebec err in law in applying former s. 613(1) (d) [now
s. 686(1) (d)] of the Criminal Code  in this
instance?

 

Analysis

 

    In
my view, the first two issues raised in this appeal are effectively resolved by
the judgment of this Court in R. v. Chaulk, [1990] 3 S.C.R.
1303.

 

    In Chaulk, this
Court reconsidered its interpretation of the word ""wrong"" in
s. 16(2) .  In Schwartz, supra, the
majority of this Court held that ""wrong"" for the purposes of
s. 16(2)  means ""legally wrong"".  The trial judge and the Court
of Appeal in the case at bar relied on our decision in Schwartz in
interpreting the second arm of s. 16(2)  and thus applied that test in a
restrictive manner that excluded any consideration of the respondent's capacity
to know the moral wrongfulness of his act.  As a result,

 Nichols J.A. felt compelled to take into
account the respondent's inability to know the moral wrongfulness of the act
under the first branch of the test, that is, as part of appreciating the
""nature or quality"" of the act.  Furthermore Beauregard J.A. invoked
s. 7  of the
Charter  in
order to extend the scope at s. 16(2)  to protect an accused who is incapable of
appreciating the moral wrongfulness of an act.

 

    I am unable to support the reasoning
that led to the Court of Appeal's conclusion.  The Court of Appeal interpreted
s. 16(2)  in a manner that clearly contradicted prior judgments of this Court. 
In accordance with our decisions in Cooper v. The Queen, supra, Kjeldsen v. The Queen, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 617, and R. v. Abbey, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 24, the
first branch of the s. 16(2)  test protects an accused who, because of a disease
of the mind, was incapable of appreciating the physical consequences of
his act.  The Court of Appeal erred in using s. 7  of the Charter  to modify the established
interpretation of this statutory provision.

 

    Despite my disagreement with the
reasons of the Court of Appeal, I believe that it reached the correct result. 
It is my opinion that if the Court of Appeal had had the benefit of this
Court's judgment in
Chaulk, it
would have reached the identical conclusion for different reasons.  It was
established at trial and accepted by the Court of Appeal that the respondent in
this case suffered from a disease of the mind to the extent that he was
rendered incapable of knowing that the act was morally wrong in the
circumstances.  He suffered from the delusion that he was God and that he had a
Divine mission to kill the victim, Mr. Fortin.  As a result, for the
reasons given by this Court in Chaulk,
I agree with the Court of Appeal that the respondent should have been acquitted
by reason of insanity.  This acquittal, however, is justified under the second
branch of s. 16(2)  and not, as the Court of Appeal decided, under the
first branch.

 

    The appellant submits that the Court
of Appeal erred in law by substituting a verdict of not guilty by reason of
insanity under former s. 613(1)(d) of the Code in this instance.  In R. v. Mailloux, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 1029, I
described the jurisdiction conferred on a court of appeal by s. 613 (at
pp. 1042‑44):

 

    I am
therefore of the view that s. 613(1) (a) governs the determination in appeal of
issues of insanity and that s. 613(1) (d) operates in two ways:  first, to enable
a court of appeal to determine the issue as would have a trial court when the
issue has not been raised below; and second, to enable the court, whether
acting under s. 613(1) (a) or s. 613(1) (d), to enter, in the appropriate case, a
verdict of ""not guilty on account of insanity"".  I am supported in
this view by the manner in which courts of appeal throughout Canada have
exercised their jurisdiction under s. 613(1) (a) and (d) as regards issues of insanity in the
context of appeals against conviction, which was usefully summarized by
respondent's counsel in its factum, substantially as follows:

 

1.When raised
for the first time in appeal the court will examine the issue and if it is
satisfied that the appellant was insane at the time of the wrongful act, it
will exercise its power under s. 613(1) (d) to quash the conviction and to
substitute the special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.

 

2.If insanity
has been raised at trial and there has been an error of law in the form of a
misdirection on the issue and,

 

a)if the court
is satisfied that a proper direction would have resulted in a verdict of not
guilty by reason of insanity, it will substitute that verdict;

 

b)if the court
is not satisfied that, absent the misdirection, the inevitable verdict would
have been not guilty be reason of insanity, it will decline to act under
s. 613(1) (d) but will order a new trial.

 

3.If there has
been no misdirection, but the verdict is either unreasonable or cannot be
supported by the evidence, the court will set aside the conviction and
substitute the special verdict provided for under s. 613(1) (d).

 

4.If there has been no error of law and
the verdict cannot be said to be unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence,
the court will decline to interfere with the verdict.  [Citations omitted.]

 

    In my respectful view, the Court of
Appeal, although basing its decision on incorrect reasons, correctly exercised
its discretion under former s. 613(1)(d) of the Code.  The facts of this case bring into play
the second principle that I summarized in Mailloux.  The defence of insanity was raised at
trial and, as discussed above, there was an error of law in the form of a
misdirection on the issue:  the jury was directed that the respondent could not
succeed under the second branch of s. 16(2)  if it was found that he had
the capacity to know that his act was a legal wrong.  I am satisfied that if
the jury had been properly directed in accordance with this Court's judgment in Chaulk, a verdict of not guilty by
reason of insanity would have been the result.  Since there was in fact a
misdirection, the third principle summarized in Mailloux does not apply and it is not necessary
to ask specifically whether the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported
by the evidence.  In my view, the Court of Appeal acted within the guidelines
set out in
Mailloux.  I
would, on this basis, affirm the decision of the Court of Appeal.

 

    For these reasons, I would dismiss
the appeal and confirm the verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity entered
by the Court of Appeal pursuant to former s. 613(1) (d) of the Criminal Code .

 

//McLachlin J.//

 

    The reasons of L'Heureux-Dubé and
McLachlin JJ. were delivered by

 

    McLachlin J. -- This is one of a series of appeals
concerned with the insanity provisions in s. 16  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  I
explained in my reasons in
R. v. Chaulk,
[1990] 3 S.C.R. 1303, how my views on s. 16  differ from those of my
colleagues Lamer C.J. and Wilson J.  In view of the peculiar circumstances of
this case, including the fact that it was heard on the same day as Chaulk and that the result for the
accused is not affected, I am issuing these reasons notwithstanding the prior
issue of judgment in
Chaulk, which
is binding.  Consistent with the position I adopted in Chaulk, therefore, I will make a
brief comment on the issues raised by this case.

 

    Lamer C.J. sets out the issues
in this case as follows:

 

    [TRANSLATION]

 

1.Did the Court
of Appeal of Quebec err in law in applying the word ""wrong"" in the
sense of ""morally wrong"" to the notion of the ""quality of the
act"" in s. 16(2)  of the Criminal Code ?

 

2.Did the Court
of Appeal of Quebec err in law in relying on s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights of
Freedoms to
expand the insanity defence to include situations where the ""disease of
the mind"" affects the motive or moral justification of an accused in
committing a criminal act?

 

3.Did the Court of Appeal of Quebec err
in law in applying former s. 613(1) (d) [now s. 686(1) (a)] of the Criminal Code  in this instance?

 

    On the first issue, I agree with
Lamer C.J. that the Court of Appeal erred in its interpretation of the
first branch of s. 16(2) , i.e., incapacity to appreciate the nature and
quality of an act or omission.  This Court has made it clear on a number of
occasions that the first branch of s. 16(2)  refers to an incapacity to
appreciate the physical character of and the physical consequences which flow
from an act or omission: 
Cooper v. The Queen,
[1980] 1 S.C.R. 1149;
Kjeldsen v. The Queen,
[1981] 2 S.C.R. 617;
R. v. Abbey,
[1982] 2 S.C.R. 24.  Collateral factors, such as an accused's emotional
attributes (Kjeldsen) or his or her capacity to
appreciate the penal consequences associated with an act or omission (Abbey), are not relevant under the first
branch of s. 16(2) .

 

    Turning to the second issue referred
to by Lamer C.J., the Court of Appeal's reference to s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms 
cannot serve to alter the position outlined above.  The sole issue in this case
is whether the accused is insane within the terms of s. 16(2) of the Code, and, as stated above, this Court has
established the appropriate test for the first branch of s. 16(2)  in Cooper, Kjeldsen, and Abbey.  I do not dispute that Criminal Code  provisions must be
interpreted in accordance with Charter 
values, but I do disagree with Beauregard J.A.'s use of s. 7  to
effectively re-interpret the first branch of s. 16(2)  in order to achieve
a result which is inconsistent with previous decisions of this Court.

 

    I agree with Lamer C.J. that the
respondent's claim of incapacity is only relevant to the second branch of
s. 16(2) , i.e., incapacity to know that an act or omission is wrong.  For
the reasons I gave in
Chaulk, I
take the view that the proper inquiry for the second branch of s. 16(2)  is
whether the accused is incapable of knowing that an act or omission is wrong,
in the sense of an act or omission that he or she ought not to do.  I do not,
therefore, share Lamer C.J.'s view that ""wrong"" in s. 16(2) 
means only ""morally wrong"".

 

    At trial the respondent was convicted
of first degree murder by a jury in the Superior Court of Quebec.  The trial
judge instructed the jury that an accused is insane within the terms of
s. 16(2)  of the
Criminal Code 
if, due to disease of the mind, he or she lacks the capacity to appreciate the
nature and quality of an act or omission or to know that the act or omission is
legally wrong.  In convicting the respondent, the jury thus rejected the claim
of insanity under both branches of s. 16(2) .  With respect to the second
branch of s. 16(2) , the jury determined that the respondent had the
capacity to know that his act was one which he ought not to do in law.  That
capacity is sufficient to remove the respondent from the terms of the second
branch of s. 16(2) ; the respondent is not someone who is incapable of
knowing that his act was wrong.

 

    Accordingly, I am of the view that
the jury's verdict cannot be disturbed.  I consider it unnecessary to address
the issue with respect to s. 686(1) (d) of the Criminal Code  (formerly s. 613(1) (d)).

under s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 .

 

    The
accused was charged with first degree murder.  At trial, he admitted killing a
police officer in New Brunswick, but raised the defence of insanity.  Following
a voir dire, the Crown adduced evidence establishing that the
accused was a suspect in a murder which had taken place in New York State, and
that he had been ordered by the authorities to provide hair and blood samples. 
The trial judge held that while the evidence was highly prejudicial to the
accused, it was relevant and probative to explain why the accused had left his
parents' home five days prior to the shooting and countered the defence of
insanity.  During his address to the jury, Crown counsel made certain
prejudicial remarks with respect to the expert testimony of a defence witness. 
The trial judge did not comment on these remarks in his charge.  The jury
rejected the defence of insanity and the accused was convicted.  On appeal, the
majority of the Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge did not err in
admitting the prejudicial evidence pertaining to the New York homicide, and
that, while certain remarks made by Crown counsel during his address to the
jury were ""personal and slanted"" and ought to have been the subject
of comment by the trial judge so as to temper their effect, the trial judge's
failure to do so did not in this case give rise to a miscarriage of justice.

 

    Held
(L'Heureux‑Dubé J. dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed and a new
trial ordered.

 

(1)
Presumption of Sanity/Presumption of Innocence

 

    Per Lamer
C.J. and Wilson, La Forest, Sopinka and Cory JJ.:  In view of the majority
judgment of this Court in Chaulk, s. 16(4) of the Criminal
Code  infringes s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  but constitutes a reasonable limit
under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    Per
L'Heureux‑Dubé and McLachlin JJ.:  For the reasons given by McLachlin J.
in Chaulk, the presumption of sanity in s. 16(4) of the Code,
reflecting as it does the fundamental pre‑condition of criminal
responsibility and punishment, does not violate s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

(2)
Admissibility of Evidence

 

    The
evidence pertaining to the homicide in New York State was properly admitted at
trial.  Evidence of the fact that the accused was under an order to provide
hair and blood samples in connection with a murder in New York State was
admissible as offering to the jury a reason for his flight from his parents'
home.  The evidence was admitted only after the defence had adduced evidence of
the accused's tendency to ""take off"" on extended trips, without
warning, following episodes of strange behaviour, in order to support the
contention that he was mentally ill at the time of the offence.

 

(3)
Prejudicial Remarks

 

    Per Lamer
C.J. and Wilson, La Forest, Sopinka, Cory and McLachlin JJ.:  The remarks of
Crown counsel were prejudicial to a degree sufficient to impose a legal duty on
the trial judge to comment and thus ensure that the position of the defence was
fairly put to the jury.  The trial judge's failure to comment on Crown
counsel's improper remarks constituted an incorrect decision on a question of
law.  No case has been made out for the application of s. 686(1)(b)(iii)
of the Code.  A new trial should be ordered.

 

    Per
L'Heureux‑Dubé J., dissenting:  For the reasons given by the majority in
the Court of Appeal, the appeal should be dismissed under s. 686(1)(b)(iii)
of the Code.  The trial judge's failure to comment in his charge to
the jury on the prejudicial remarks of Crown counsel did not amount to a
miscarriage of justice in the circumstances of this case.

//Lamer C.J.//

 

    The
judgment of Lamer C.J., La Forest, Sopinka and Cory JJ. was delivered by

 

    Lamer C.J. --
On March 8, 1987, the accused shot and killed a highway patrol officer who had
stopped him for speeding on a rural road near Fredericton.  The accused was
charged with first degree murder, contrary to s. 235  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (formerly s. 218 ).  At trial,
the accused pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.

 

    Romeo
was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without
eligibility for parole for a period of twenty‑five years.  The accused's
appeal to the New Brunswick Court of Appeal was dismissed, Ayles J.A.
dissenting on a question of law: (1989), 93 N.B.R. (2d) 332.  The accused now
appeals to this Court.

 

The
Facts

 

    Prior
to the time of the offence, the accused had lived with his parents in New York
State.  Evidence was adduced at trial to establish that he had suffered from
psychiatric problems since adolescence and would periodically leave his
parents' home without warning to go on extended trips.  Evidence was also
admitted which established that the accused was a suspect in a murder which had
taken place in New York State, and had been ordered to submit to the
authorities by March 7, 1987, in order to provide hair and blood samples.  The
accused left his parents' home in New York State on March 3, 1987 and travelled
by car through Quebec and on to New Brunswick.  Several days later, the accused
shot and killed the highway patrol officer who had stopped him for speeding.

 

    At
trial, the evidence pertaining to the New York State homicide was admitted
after a voir dire.  The trial judge held that while the evidence was
highly prejudicial to the accused, it was relevant and probative to explain why
Romeo had left his parents' home five days prior to the shooting and it
therefore countered the defence of insanity.

 

    Certain
prejudicial remarks were made by Crown counsel during his address to the jury,
with respect to the expert testimony of a defence witness:

 

Now, I
have no quarrel, really, with Suzanne Canning's qualifications, but like
Dr. Akhtar, I submit that she is totally wrong, very wrong.  I submit
that, first of all, she's an excellent witness, very good witness, I think
she -‑ she can talk.  I'm a lawyer, have been now 30 years, I don't
come close to her.  She is good, I'll say that, but I submit that she is
good in telling stories and that's what she told you, and somebody has made
up a story in the whole case, story of insanity, and that's what was given to
you, and this story can't be simple because it had to match so many other
facts, so what was given to you was even much more than what you see in
fairy tales.  Fairy tales seem believable some but this is something I
submit is far beyond fairy tales.  You have to have a monster or a butcher,
you have to have a phantom automobile, you have to have racketeering, some
underworld going on, and because only when you have all these other delusions
that you can answer every action of the accused, but on this monster, it's
interesting, and very interesting, a lot of things Suzanne Canning has tried to
cover.  There is no description of the monster itself, and I bet -‑ we
didn't ask, but if we asked we probably would have had a painting of the
monster from Dr. Suzanne Canning, but I'm just saying that if there was a
delusion and Suzanne Canning was examining Mr. Romeo would you not expect
Suzanne Canning to ask Mr. Romeo, ""What kind of monster, would you
describe the monster"".  Did it look like Hitler, did it look like some
big, huge man?  He was going around cutting people's heads.  If you are a
psychiatrist, well, what did he use, a chainsaw?  How was he cutting off
people's -‑ where was he burning the bodies.  Just it's thrown before
you, that's the delusions.  Now, maybe Mr. Romeo would not have been able
to describe but there's nothing to explain.  Just as I said, the monster is
cast in front of us, and it boggles my mind.  I've heard many stories but this
is the top. [Emphasis added.]

Stevenson
J. did not comment on these remarks in his charge to the jury.

 

Lower
Court Judgments

 

New
Brunswick Court of Queen's Bench (Stevenson J.)

 

    The
appellant was tried in the New Brunswick Court of Queen's Bench before
Stevenson J., sitting with a jury.  Defence counsel admitted that the appellant
had shot and killed the highway patrol officer, but raised the defence of
insanity.  The jury rejected the defence of insanity and the appellant was
convicted of first degree murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment without
eligibility for parole for a period of 25 years.

 

Court of Appeal for New Brunswick (Angers, Ayles
(dissenting) and Ryan JJ.A.)

 

    The
appellant appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeal for New Brunswick on a
number of grounds including:  that the learned trial judge erred in admitting
evidence pertaining to a homicide in New York State; and that the learned trial
judge erred in his charge to the jury in that he was inconsistent in his
directions on the essential elements of first degree murder, did not properly
characterize the theory of the defence, failed to mention certain evidence
supportive of the defence, gave differing treatment to psychiatrists for the
defence and Crown, and failed to properly warn the jury to disregard certain
inflammatory and prejudicial remarks made by Crown counsel during the trial.

 

    The
majority of the Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge did not err in
admitting the prejudicial evidence pertaining to the New York State homicide. 
With respect to the trial judge's charge to the jury, the majority held that
the jury was properly and adequately informed with respect to the nature of the
appellant's defence and found no favoritism or bias in the language used by the
trial judge when referring to the psychiatric evidence.  The majority rejected
the appellant's contention that Stevenson J. had misdirected the jury on the
essential elements of first degree murder.

 

    Finally,
the majority found that while certain remarks made by Crown counsel during his
address to the jury were ""personal and slanted"" and ought to have
been the subject of comment by the trial judge so as to temper their effect,
the failure of the trial judge to comment on the inappropriateness of the
remarks did not give rise to a miscarriage of justice when the whole of the
evidence was taken into account.

 

    Ayles
J.A., in dissent, held that Crown counsel's remarks were calculated to inflame
the jury and did not deal with the proper question of ""which expert
witness was to be believed"".  He stated (at p. 356):

 

The intemperate statements in my view were unfair and
prejudicial and ought to have been commented upon by the trial judge so as to
refocus the minds of the jurors on the real question in issue.

 

    In
my opinion, the trial judge's failure to instruct the jury as to these comments
was a nondirection that amounted to an error of law.

 

Ayles
J.A. was of the view that no case had been made out for the application of
s. 613(1)(b)(iii) (now s. 686(1)(b)(iii))
and that a new trial should therefore be ordered.

 

Issues

 

    The
following constitutional questions were stated by Dickson C.J. on August 18,
1989:

 

1.  Is s. 16(4) of the Criminal Code 
inconsistent with s. 7  or s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.  If
the answer to question 1 is yes, is s. 16(4) justified by s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with
the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    The
appellant has raised two further grounds of appeal in this Court:

 

3.  That the New Brunswick Court of Appeal erred in
ruling that the trial judge had not erred in admitting evidence pertaining to a
homicide in New York State in connection with which the appellant had been
ordered to provide hair and blood samples as a suspect.

 

4.  That
the majority in the New Brunswick Court of Appeal erred in failing to hold that
the failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury with respect to the
prejudicial remarks of Crown counsel constituted an error which could not be
remedied by the application of section 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code .

 

Analysis

 

    The
constitutional questions have been fully canvassed in this Court's judgment in R. v.
Chaulk, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1303.  In Chaulk, I held
that while s. 16(4)  of the Criminal Code  does infringe
s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , it
constitutes a reasonable limit under s. 1  of the Charter  and,
therefore, is not inconsistent with the Constitution Act,
1982 .  Accordingly, the first two grounds of appeal fail.  I
turn now to a consideration of the other issues raised by the appellant.

 

Evidence
Pertaining to the Homicide in New York State

 

    There
are two basic questions which must be addressed in order to resolve this
issue.  The first question is whether this evidence was wrongly admitted at
trial.  If the evidence was wrongly admitted, the question arises
whether the appeal should be nonetheless dismissed under s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
on the basis that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.

 

    In
my view, the evidence was properly admitted at trial.  I agree with the Court
of Appeal that evidence of the fact that Romeo was under an order to provide
hair and blood samples in connection with a murder in New York State was
admissible as offering to the jury a reason for his flight other than that it
was another of Romeo's ""sudden unexplained departures from home"". 
This evidence was admitted only after the defence had adduced evidence (through
the testimony of Romeo's father) of the accused's tendency to ""take
off"" on extended trips, without warning, following episodes of strange
behaviour, in order to support the contention that he was mentally ill at the
time of the offence.

 

    Having
found that the evidence was not wrongly admitted at trial, it is unnecessary to
consider the application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
to this issue and the third ground of appeal fails.

 

Prejudicial
Remarks by Crown Counsel

 

    There
are two basic questions which must be addressed in order to resolve this
issue.  The first question is whether the trial judge erred in not commenting
on the prejudicial remarks of Crown counsel in his charge to the jury.  If the
nondirection does amount to an error of law, the question arises whether the
appeal should be nonetheless dismissed under s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
on the basis that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.

 

    I am
in complete agreement with the dissenting reasons of Ayles J.A. with respect to
this issue (at pp. 358-59):

 

[T]he
remarks of Crown counsel were prejudicial to a degree sufficient to impose a
legal duty on the trial judge to comment and thus ensure that the position of
the defence, in this case the appellant's alleged insanity at the time that
Officer Aucoin was killed, was fairly put to the jury.  The failure of the
trial judge to comment on Crown counsel's improper remarks constituted an
incorrect decision on a question of law.

 

I also
share his view that no case has been made out for the application of
s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .  I
would therefore allow the appeal and order a new trial.

 

// Wilson J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    Wilson J. -- I
have had the benefit of reading Chief Justice Lamer's reasons in this appeal. 
The first two issues concern the constitutionality of s. 16(4)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  Dickson C.J. stated the
constitutional questions as follows:

 

1. Is s. 16(4) of the Criminal Code  of
Canada inconsistent with s. 7  or s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.  If
the answer to question 1 is yes, is s. 16(4) justified by s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with
the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    In
the appeal in R. v. Chaulk, [1990] 3 S.C.R.
1303, the majority of this Court held that while s. 16(4)  of the Criminal
Code  infringed an accused's right to be presumed innocent in
s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , it
constituted a reasonable and justifiable limit on such right within the meaning
of s. 1  of the Charter .  I dissented on that issue holding
that the infringement was not a reasonable and justifiable limit on the s. 11 (d)
right.  I now consider myself bound by the majority decision in Chaulk. 
Accordingly, since I agree with Lamer C.J.'s reasons on the other issues raised
by the appellant, I concur in his proposed disposition of this appeal.

 

//L'Heureux-Dubé//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    L'Heureux-Dubé J.
(dissenting) -- I have had the advantage of reading both the reasons of Chief
Justice Lamer and Justice McLachlin.

 

    I
respectfully agree with McLachlin J. in all respects except as to the ground of
appeal relating to the Crown counsel's remarks.  Both the Chief Justice and my
colleague would order a new trial because of the failure of the trial judge in
his charge to the jury to comment on Crown counsel's remarks.  I disagree.

 

    On
that issue, I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal for the reasons
they expressed.   While the Crown counsel's remarks were unfavourably slanted
and ought to have been commented upon by the trial judge in his jury charge, I
am not convinced that the trial judge's failure to comment amounted to a
miscarriage of justice in the circumstances of this case.  I would therefore
dismiss the appeal under s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .

 

//McLachlin
J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    McLachlin J. --
This is one of a series of cases raising fundamental questions relating to the
presumption of sanity in s. 16  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .   As I explained in R. v. Chaulk, [1990]
3 S.C.R. 1303, I respectfully disagree with my colleagues, Lamer C.J. and
Wilson J., as to the proper resolution of these questions.  In view of the
peculiar circumstances of this case, including the fact that it was heard on
the same day as Chaulk and that the result for the accused
is not affected, I am issuing these reasons notwithstanding the prior issue of
judgment in Chaulk, which is binding.  I will therefore
address one of the issues raised in this case in view of my conclusions in Chaulk.

 

    The
appellant argues that the presumption of sanity in s. 16(4)  of the Criminal
Code  offends the presumption of innocence found in
s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  As I
explained in my reasons in Chaulk, I am of the view that the
presumption of sanity, reflecting as it does the fundamental pre-condition of
criminal responsibility and punishment, does not violate s. 11 (d). 
Accordingly, this ground of appeal fails, and it is unnecessary for me to
consider application of s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    With
respect to the other two grounds of appeal, I am in agreement with
Lamer C.J.  For the reasons expressed by Lamer C.J., the evidence
pertaining to the homicide in New York State was properly admitted at trial.  I
further agree with Lamer C.J., however, that a new trial must be ordered
because of the trial judge's error in not commenting in his charge to the jury
on the prejudicial remarks of Crown counsel.

 

    I
agree, therefore, that the appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

    The
accused killed his wife and was charged with first degree murder.  At trial,
the accused raised the defence of insanity.  The defence psychiatrists
testified that the accused suffered from paranoid schizophrenia at the time the
act was committed.  This mental disorder caused delusions.  He heard voices
telling him that he and his family were cursed and that they had to return to
India.  Although the accused was aware at the time that he was killing his
wife, he believed that she would be corrupted if she did not return to India
with him and that it was therefore necessary to kill her.  Evidence was presented
by the Crown at trial that challenged appellant's credibility with respect to
both his mental health at the time of the incident and his awareness that what
he was doing was wrong.  During their deliberations, the jurors asked the trial
judge whether the capacity to know that an act is wrong for the purposes of
s. 16(2)  of the Criminal Code  means the 
capacity to know that it is morally wrong, legally wrong, or both.  The trial
judge responded that ""knowing an act is wrong"" meant legally wrong. 
The jury rejected the defence and convicted the accused.  The Court of Appeal
affirmed the conviction.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

(1)
Presumption of Sanity/Presumption of Innocence

 

    Per Lamer
C.J. and Wilson, La Forest, Sopinka and Cory JJ.:  In view of the majority
judgment of this Court in Chaulk, s. 16(4) of the Criminal
Code  infringes s. 11 (d) of the Charter  but
constitutes a reasonable limit under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    Per
L'Heureux‑Dubé and McLachlin JJ.:  For the reasons given by McLachlin J.
in Chaulk, the presumption of sanity in s. 16(4) of the Code,
reflecting as it does the fundamental pre‑condition of criminal
responsibility and punishment, does not violate s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

(2) Meaning of
""Wrong""

 

    Per Lamer
C.J. and Wilson, La Forest, Sopinka and Cory JJ.:  Given that the majority
judgment of this Court in Chaulk redefined the word ""wrong""
in s. 16(2) of the Code to mean ""morally wrong""
rather than ""legally wrong"", the jury was misdirected on the issue of
insanity.  A new trial should be ordered under s. 686(2)(b) of the Code because
this Court is not satisfied that, in the absence of the misdirection, the
inevitable verdict would have been not guilty by reason of insanity.  In
accordance with Chaulk, the trier of fact must be directed
to consider whether the accused was rendered incapable, by reason of disease of
the mind or natural imbecility, to know that his act was morally wrong in the
circumstances.  It is not sufficient to decide that the accused's act was a
result of his delusion.  Even if the act was motivated by the delusion, the
accused will be convicted if he was capable of knowing, in spite of such delusion,
that the act in the particular circumstances would have been morally condemned
by reasonable members of society.

 

    Per
L'Heureux‑Dubé  and McLachlin JJ.:  For the reasons given by McLachlin J.
in Chaulk, the jury, having been instructed by the trial judge
that ""wrong"" in s. 16(2) of the Code means
""legally wrong"", would properly have considered whether the act was
one which the accused was capable of knowing that he ought not to do.  There
was therefore no error of law which would justify interference by this Court
with the jury's guilty verdict.  The jury's verdict was neither unreasonable
nor unsupported by the evidence within the terms of s. 686(1)(a)(i) of
the Code. It follows that this appeal would have been dismissed
but, given the majority judgment of this Court in Chaulk, which
is binding, it must be allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

(3) Expert
Evidence

 

    The
trial judge did not err in instructing the jury that it was unsafe for a jury
to arrive at a verdict based on expert evidence alone.  In the context of
discussing the weight that should be attached to expert evidence in general and
the role of the jury as the sole trier of fact, the trial judge was correct in
advising the jury that they were not bound by the expert psychiatric testimony
and that its probative value was to be assessed in the same manner as any other
testimony.

 

(4) Fresh
Evidence

 

    Per Lamer
C.J. and Wilson, La Forest, Sopinka and Cory JJ.:  In view of this Court's
decision to order a new trial, it is unnecessary to determine whether or not
the Court of Appeal erred in failing to consider certain medical reports as
fresh evidence pursuant to s. 683(1)(d) of the Code.

 

    Per
L'Heureux‑Dubé and McLachlin JJ.:  The Court of Appeal did not err in
refusing to consider certain reports as fresh evidence.  The court correctly
applied the principles set out by this Court in Palmer.

//Lamer C.J.//

 

    The
judgment of Lamer C.J. and La Forest and Cory JJ. was delivered by

 

    Lamer C.J. --
This case involves a constitutional challenge, under s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , to the reverse onus clause contained
in s. 16(4) of the insanity provisions contained in the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  There are other issues
specific to the appeal that are set out further in these reasons.

 

Facts

    On
the night of May 2, 1986, or early in the morning of May 3, 1986, the appellant
caused the death of his wife by striking her several times on the side of the
head with an axe.  The appellant was subsequently convicted of first degree
murder by a jury in the High Court of Justice of Ontario.

 

    Much
of the evidence at trial came from an agreed statement of facts.  It was
admitted by the appellant that he had made arrangements, several days before
the incident, to return to his native country, India, along with his two
children.  To this end, he purchased three airline tickets and collected them
on May 2, 1986.  He also purchased a number of other items during this period,
including an axe and a suitcase.  The appellant admitted that he and his wife
argued over a number of matters several days before the incident, to the extent
that his wife left their home in order to stay with relatives for a short time,
returning only on the afternoon of May 2, 1986.  The argument that caused her
to leave was precipitated in part by the appellant's decision to quit his job. 
The spouses had also disagreed on numerous occasions as to whether the family
should return to India.

 

    Immediately
after killing his wife, the appellant tried but failed to enlist the help of
friends in order to remove her body from the home. He finally severed the body
into smaller parts with an axe and disposed of them in a nearby river.  He
cleaned the premises and later made attempts to enter the United States.

 

    The
sole defence raised by the appellant at trial was the insanity defence under s.
16  of the Criminal Code .  Expert
psychiatric evidence was given at trial that the appellant suffered from
paranoid schizophrenia at the time that the act was committed.  The mental
disorder caused the appellant to become deluded that he was a prophet who had
been called upon by God to lead the world in forming an international
government; the disorder also caused him to hear voices telling him that he and
his family were cursed and that they must return to India.  Although the
appellant was aware at the time that he was killing his wife and likely knew
that the act was a crime, he believed that his wife would be corrupted if she
did not return to India with him and that it was therefore necessary to kill
her.  The evidence also suggested that the appellant believed that his wife
would be ""reborn"" in India as a living person.

 

    An
appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was unanimously dismissed on November 2,
1988.

 

Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

Criminal
Code 

 

    16. (1)  No person shall be convicted of
an offence in respect of an act or omission on his part while that person was
insane.

 

    (2)  For the purposes of this section, a person is
insane when the person is in a state of natural imbecility or has disease of
the mind to an extent that renders the person incapable of appreciating the
nature and quality of an act or omission or of knowing that an act or omission
is wrong.

 

    (3)  A person who has specific delusions, but is in
other respects sane, shall not be acquitted on the ground of insanity unless
the delusions caused that person to believe in the existence of a state of
things that, if it existed, would have justified or excused the act or omission
of that person.

 

    (4)  Every one shall, until the contrary is proved,
be presumed to be and to have been sane.

Court Judgments

 

Ontario
High Court of Justice

 

    The
appellant was tried before Callaghan A.C.J., sitting with a jury, in the High
Court of Justice, and was convicted of first degree murder.  The only defence
raised at trial, the insanity defence, was rejected by the jury.  The appellant
was sentenced to life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for 25 years.

 

Ontario
Court of Appeal (Dubin A.C.J.O., for the Court)

 

    The
appellant appealed his conviction to the Ontario Court of Appeal on the grounds
that the trial judge erred in law by refusing to enter certain medical reports
as exhibits in the trial, that the trial judge erred in law by refusing to
permit the jury to have certain medical reports before them during their
deliberations, that the trial judge erred in law in his instruction to the jury
as to the relationship between s. 16  and the definition of first degree murder,
and that the verdict was unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence.

 

    The
Court of Appeal found no error in the trial judge's charge to the jury and
concluded that the verdict rendered was reasonable:

 

    The defence relied on two psychiatrists, well
qualified in their field and well known to the justice system, and there is no
doubt on the evidence, apart from the psychiatric evidence itself, that the
appellant suffers from some disease of the mind. However, the issue of insanity
in this case was whether the disease of the mind fell within the definition of
s. 16  of the Criminal Code .

 

    A
verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity would have been open to this jury,
but unlike many cases of this nature, there was a factual and an evidentiary
basis upon which the jury could reject the psychiatric evidence and find that
the disease of the mind was not one which would warrant a finding of not guilty
by reason of insanity.

 

    The
appellant now appeals the judgment of the Court of Appeal to this Court.

 

Issues

 

    The
following constitutional questions were stated by Dickson C.J. on July 13,
1989:

 

1.Is s. 16(4) of the Criminal Code 
inconsistent with s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If the
answer to question 1 is yes, is s. 16(4) justified by s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with
the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    The
appellant raises four further issues in this Court:

 

3.Did the Ontario Court of Appeal err in law in refusing
to hold that the Court had the power, pursuant to section 613(1)(d) (now
section 686(1) (d)) of the Criminal Code  of Canada, to review the
evidence apart from the jury finding and substitute a finding of not guilty by reason
of insanity?

 

4.Did the Ontario Court of Appeal err in law in failing
to hold that the verdict of guilty of the offence of first degree murder was
unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence pursuant to section
613(1)(a)(i) (now 686(1)(a)(i)) of the Criminal Code  of
Canada and that a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity
should be substituted?

 

5.Did the Ontario Court of Appeal err in law in failing
to hold that the learned trial Judge erred in instructing the jury that it was
unsafe for a jury to arrive at a verdict based on the testimony of experts
alone?

 

6.Did
the Ontario Court of Appeal err in law in failing to consider upon appeal
further medical reports dealing with the issue of the sanity of the Appellant?

 

Analysis

 

Constitutional
Questions

 

    The
constitutional questions have been fully canvassed in this Court's judgment in R. v.
Chaulk, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1303.  In Chaulk, I held
that, although s. 16(4)  of the Criminal Code 
infringes s. 11 (d) of the Charter , it constitutes a
reasonable limit under s. 1  of the Charter  and, therefore, is
not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 .  Accordingly, the
first two grounds of appeal fail.  I now turn to a consideration of the other
issues raised by the appellant.

 

Issues Nos.
3 and 4

 

    The
appellant submits that the Court of Appeal erred in law by failing to
substitute a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity under former s.
613(1) (d) or former s. 613(1) (a)(i) of
the Criminal Code .  The jurisdiction conferred on a court of appeal under
s. 613(1)  was described by this Court in R. v.  Mailloux, [1988]
2 S.C.R. 1029.  I stated at pp. 1042-44:

 

    I am therefore of the view that s. 613(1) (a)
governs the determination in appeal of issues of insanity and that s. 613(1) (d)
operates in two ways: first, to enable a court of appeal to determine the issue
as would have a trial court when the issue has not been raised below; and
second, to enable the court, whether acting under s. 613(1) (a) or s.
613(1) (d), to enter, in the appropriate case, a verdict of
""not guilty on account of insanity"". I am supported in this view by
the manner in which courts of appeal throughout Canada have exercised their
jurisdiction under s. 613(1) (a) and (d) as
regards issues of insanity in the context of appeals against conviction, which
was usefully summarized by respondent's counsel in its factum, substantially as
follows:

 

1.When raised for the first time in appeal the court
will examine the issue and if it is satisfied that the appellant was insane at
the time of the wrongful act, it will exercise its power under s. 613(1) (d) to
quash the conviction and to substitute the special verdict of not guilty by
reason of insanity.

 

2.If insanity has been raised at trial and there has
been an error of law in the form of a misdirection on the issue and,

 

a)if the court is satisfied that a proper direction
would have resulted in a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, it will
substitute that verdict;

 

b)if the court is not satisfied that, absent the
misdirection, the inevitable verdict would have been not guilty by reason of
insanity, it will decline to act under s. 613(1) (d) but
will order a new trial.

 

3.If there has been no misdirection, but the verdict is
either unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence, the court will set
aside the conviction and substitute the special verdict provided for under s.
613(1) (d).

 

4.If
there has been no error of law and the verdict cannot be said to be unreasonable
or unsupported by the evidence, the court will decline to interfere with the
verdict. [Citations omitted.]

 

    In
my view, in light of the judgment of this Court in Chaulk, the
facts of this case invoke the application of the second principle that I summarized
in Mailloux.  In Chaulk, this Court reconsidered the meaning
of ""wrong"" in s. 16(2) .  The earlier decision of this Court in Schwartz
v. The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 673, was overruled and
""wrong"" for the purposes of the second arm of s. 16(2)  was defined to
mean ""morally wrong"" and not ""legally wrong"". It is
apparent that the trial judge relied on our decision in Schwartz in
directing the jury with respect to the application of s. 16 . He stated in his
charge:

 

    Now
there is an alternative in [s. 16 ]. Even if he did appreciate the nature and
quality of what he was doing, by that definition it is also insanity if he was
labouring under a disease of the mind that rendered him incapable of knowing
his act was wrong and by ""wrong"", I mean that it was a criminal act
or legally wrong.

 

There is
no doubt that this definition was relevant to the jury. In the course of their
deliberations, they asked the trial judge specifically whether the capacity to
know that an act is wrong for the purposes of s. 16(2)  means the  capacity to
know that it is morally wrong, legally wrong, or both.  The trial judge
responded:

 

    Now,
you asked the question, does knowing an act is wrong mean morally wrong,
legally wrong or both and the answer is no. When I talk about knowing an act is
wrong, we mean that it was a criminal act, was legally wrong. Morality has
nothing to do with it. Did he know what he was doing was a crime? That's the
answer to that one.

 

    Given
the reconsideration of the word ""wrong"" by this Court in Chaulk, it is
my respectful opinion that the jury was misdirected on the issue of insanity. 
The proper direction to the jury would have indicated that the appellant should
be found not guilty by reason of insanity if, because of a disease of the mind,
he lacked the capacity to know that his act was morally wrong in the
circumstances.  The trial judge, of course, cannot be faulted since he relied
on the decision of this Court in Schwartz, supra. 
However, for the reasons given in Chaulk, our decision in Schwartz was not
correct.

 

    I am
not satisfied that, in the absence of a misdirection on the issue, the
inevitable verdict would have been not guilty by reason of insanity.  On the
one hand, the evidence adduced at trial suggests that the appellant did not
know that the act of killing his wife was morally wrong in the circumstances. 
The trial judge, in the course of his charge to the jury, summarized the
testimony of an expert witness as to whether the appellant knew at the time
that his act was legally wrong; the expert witness had testified to the effect
that:

 

    At
the time of the killing, however, he wouldn't realize it was legally wrong as
he was in a state of delusional belief and was being instructed by voices from
his guru.  He was under an hallucination at the time he was being told
something had to be done and he was doing God's will. 

 

The
trial judge also summarized this aspect of the defence's case as follows:

 

    He
was operating within a context such as to believe what he was doing was right
even though he knew what he was doing was wrong in terms of what society would
say. 

 

    On
the other hand, however, evidence was presented by the Crown at trial that
challenged the credibility of the appellant with respect to both his mental
health at the time of the incident and his awareness that what he was doing was
wrong.

 

    Since
I am not satisfied that, in the absence of a misdirection, the inevitable
verdict would have been not guilty by reason of insanity, I would not
substitute a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity for the conviction,
but would instead order a new trial.  In accordance with our decision in Chaulk, the
trier of fact must be directed to consider whether the appellant was rendered
incapable, by reason of disease of the mind or ""natural imbecility"",
to know that his act was morally wrong in the circumstances.  It is not
sufficient to decide that the appellant's act was a result of his
delusion.  Even if the act was motivated by the delusion, the appellant will
be convicted if he was capable of knowing, in spite of such delusion, that the
act in the particular circumstances would have been morally condemned by
reasonable members of society.

 

    In
view of the fact that this appeal is subject to the second principle discussed
in Mailloux, it is not necessary to consider specifically the
application of the third principle, namely, whether the verdict was
unreasonable or was unable to be supported by the evidence even if there had
not been a misdirection.

 

    For
these reasons, I would allow the appeal pursuant to former s. 613(1) (a) and
order a new trial pursuant to former s. 613(2) (b) of the Criminal
Code .

 

Issue No. 5

 

    The
appellant submits that the Court of Appeal erred in law by failing to hold that
the trial judge misdirected the jury by instructing that it was unsafe to
arrive at a verdict based on expert evidence alone. Specifically, the
appellant's submission is directed at the following statement by the trial
judge:

 

    The evidence of Drs. Malcolm and Rowsell is of
particular importance in this case, as you can well imagine.  Psychiatry, like
any other branch of medicine, is not an exact science.  An individual judgement
is always a factor in psychiatric assessments. Like other witnesses you will
simply have to compare the capacities of the two psychiatrists for observation
and the abilities of each to draw their conclusions.

 

    It
has been said in a criminal trial it is not safe for a jury to arrive at a
verdict on expert evidence alone.  Please recall my earlier direction, you are
the sole judges of the facts and in determining the facts you may believe all
or none or only part of the evidence of the expert witnesses.  There is no
distinction when applying that general principle which you apply to the evidence
of ordinary witnesses, in applying it to the evidence of experts.

 

    In
my view, the trial judge made no error in instructing the jury in this regard. 
The statement cited above was made in the context of discussing the weight that
should be attached to expert evidence in general and the role of the jury as
the sole trier of fact.  The trial judge was entirely correct in advising the
jury that they were not bound by the expert psychiatric testimony and that its
probative value was to be assessed in the same manner as any other testimony.
In this case, factual evidence with respect to the appellant's insanity was
placed before the jury.  As a result, the jury was in a position to assess the
weight that should be given to the testimony by considering whether it was
supported by the facts.  The trial judge correctly advised the jury to consider
the expert testimony in relation to the facts and that the testimony could be
rejected if it was based upon factual assumptions with which they disagreed.

 

Issue No. 6

 

    The
appellant submits that the Court of Appeal erred in law in failing to consider
certain medical reports as ""fresh evidence"" pursuant to former s.
610(1)(d) (now s. 683(1) (d)) of
the Criminal Code .  The medical reports sought to be adduced before the
Court of Appeal were, first, a report prepared by the Penetang Mental Health
Centre shortly after the appellant's arrest and, secondly, a report prepared by
a penetentiary service medical unit following the appellant's conviction.

 

    In
view of my decision to order a new trial, as a result of the holding of this
Court in Chaulk, it is not necessary to address this
issue.  The appellant will be entitled, subject, of course, to the discretion
of the trial judge, to evaluate the relevance of evidence, to adduce this
evidence at his second trial.  The exercise of the Court of Appeal's discretion
under former s. 610(1)(d) of the Code is no longer an
issue.

 

Disposition

 

    Accordingly,
for the reasons discussed above, I would allow the appeal pursuant to former s.
613(1) (a) and order a new trial pursuant to former s. 613(2) (b) of the Criminal
Code .

 

//Wilson J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    Wilson J. -- I
have had the benefit of reading Chief Justice Lamer's reasons in this appeal. 
The first two issues concern the constitutionality of s. 16(4)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  Dickson C.J. stated the
constitutional questions as follows: 

 

1.Is s. 16(4) of the Criminal Code 
inconsistent with s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If the
answer to question 1 is yes, is s. 16(4) justified by s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with
the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    In
the appeal R. v. Chaulk, [1990] 3 S.C.R.
1303, the majority of this Court held that while s. 16(4)  of the Criminal
Code  infringed an accused's right to be presumed innocent in
s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , it
constituted a reasonable and justifiable limit on such right within the meaning
of s. 1  of the Charter .  I dissented on that issue holding
that the infringement was not a reasonable and justifiable limit on the s. 11 (d)
right.  I now consider myself bound by the majority decision in Chaulk. 
Accordingly, since I agree with Lamer C.J.'s reasons on the other issues raised
by the appellant, I concur in his proposed disposition of this appeal.

 

//McLachlin
J.//

 

    The
reasons of L'Heureux-Dubé and McLachlin JJ. were delivered by

 

    McLachlin J. --
This is one of a series of appeals raising questions about the presumption of
sanity in s. 16  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.
C-46 .  In R. v. Chaulk, [1990] 3 S.C.R.
1303, I indicated that I respectfully disagree with Lamer C.J. and
Wilson J. as to the proper resolution of the following two questions:  (1)
does the presumption of sanity offend the presumption of innocence embodied in
s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ? and
(2) when the Code speaks of ""knowing that an act
or omission is wrong"", does it mean legally ""wrong"" or morally
""wrong""?   In view of the peculiar circumstances of this case,
including the fact that it was heard on the same day as Chaulk and
that the result for the accused is not affected, I am issuing these reasons
notwithstanding the prior issue of judgment in Chaulk, which
is binding.  My conclusions in Chaulk, therefore, make it
necessary to comment briefly on the issues raised by this case.

 

    The
first two issues set out in the judgment of Lamer C.J. concern the
question of whether the presumption of sanity in s. 16(4) of the Code is
inconsistent with s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  For
the reasons I gave in Chaulk, I am of the view that the
presumption of sanity, reflecting as it does the fundamental pre-condition to
attribution of criminal responsibility and punishment, does not violate the
presumption of innocence found in s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  In
view of this conclusion, I need not consider the residual question of the
application of s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    The
next two questions set out by Lamer C.J. concern the jurisdiction of the
Court of Appeal under s. 686(1)  of the Criminal Code 
(formerly s. 613(1) ).  In light of Lamer C.J.'s conclusion as to the
meaning of ""wrong"" in s. 16(2) , he directs that a new trial be
held in order for the trier of fact to determine whether the appellant was
rendered incapable, by reason of disease of the mind or ""natural imbecility"",
of knowing that his act was morally wrong in the circumstances.  As I explained
in Chaulk, I do not agree with Lamer C.J.'s interpretation of
""wrong"" in s. 16(2)  and I am satisfied that the jury, having been
instructed by the trial judge that ""wrong"" in s. 16(2)  means
""legally wrong"", would properly have considered whether the act was
one which the appellant was capable of knowing that he ought not to do.  I am
of the opinion, therefore, that there is no error of law which would justify
interference by this Court with the jury's guilty verdict.  I further conclude
that the jury's verdict is neither unreasonable nor unsupported by the evidence
within the terms of s. 686(1) (a)(i).

 

    I am
in agreement with Lamer C.J.'s treatment of the fifth issue set out in his
reasons that the trial judge's instruction to the jury on the matter of a
verdict based on expert evidence did not amount to error.

 

    Turning
to the sixth issue raised by the appellant, Lamer C.J. considered it
unnecessary to consider this question in view of his holding under
s. 686(1) .  I am of the view that the Court of Appeal did not err in
refusing to consider the further medical reports.  The Court of Appeal appears
to have correctly applied the principles set out in Palmer v. The Queen, [1980]
1 S.C.R. 759, and, accordingly, this ground of appeal must also fail.

 

    I
would dismiss the appeal, were I not bound by Chaulk.

    The
judgment of the Court was delivered orally by

 

    Sopinka J. ‑‑
It will not be necessary to call on you Mr. Lawlor.  We are prepared to
give judgment in this appeal.

 

    Having
reviewed and considered the evidence and the findings of the trial judge we are
of the opinion that the judgment of the trial judge is not unreasonable and is
not one that cannot be supported by the evidence within the meaning of
s. 686(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 .

 

    The
trial judgment was based substantially on an express finding of credibility
with respect to the evidence of the complainant.  There is nothing in the
record to indicate that there was any inherent improbability in her evidence or
any other basis which would justify interference by an appellate court with the
findings of the trial judge.  Moreover there was some support for her testimony
in other evidence which was accepted by the trial judge.

 

    In
view of this conclusion it is unnecessary to consider whether it was
appropriate for the Court of Appeal to take into account the failure of the
accused to testify and we do not do so.

 

    Accordingly
the appeal is dismissed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for
alberta

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Evidence ‑‑ Crown's obligation to make disclosure to defence ‑‑
Witness favourable to accused interviewed by police ‑‑ Crown not
calling witness and refusing to produce statements obtained ‑‑
Whether Crown obliged to disclose statements.

 

                   The accused, a
lawyer, was charged with breach of trust, theft and fraud.  A former secretary
of his was a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry, where she gave evidence
apparently favourable to the defence.  After the preliminary inquiry but prior
to trial, the witness was interviewed by an RCMP officer and a tape‑recorded
statement was taken.  Later, during the course of the trial, the witness was
again interviewed by a police officer and a written statement taken.  Defence
counsel was informed of the existence but not of the content of the
statements.  His requests for disclosure were refused.  During the trial
defence counsel learned conclusively that the witness would not be called by
the Crown and sought an order that the witness be called or that the Crown
disclose the contents of the statements to the defence.  The trial judge
dismissed the application.  The trial proceeded and the accused was convicted
of breach of trust and fraud.  Conditional stays were entered with respect to
the theft counts.  The Court of Appeal affirmed the convictions without giving
reasons.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be allowed and a
new trial ordered.

 

                   The Crown has a
legal duty to disclose all relevant information to the defence.  The fruits of
the investigation which are in its possession are not the property of the Crown
for use in securing a conviction but the property of the public to be used to
ensure that justice is done.  The obligation to disclose is subject to a
discretion with respect to the withholding of information and to the timing and
manner of disclosure.  Crown counsel has a duty to respect the rules of
privilege and to protect the identity of informers.  A discretion must also be
exercised with respect to the relevance of information.  The Crown's discretion
is reviewable by the trial judge, who should be guided by the general principle
that information should not be withheld if there is a reasonable possibility
that this will impair the right of the accused to make full answer and
defence.  The absolute withholding of information which is relevant to the
defence can only be justified on the basis of the existence of a legal
privilege which excludes the information from disclosure.  This privilege is
reviewable, however, on the ground that it is not a reasonable limit on the
right to make full answer and defence in a particular case.

 

                   Counsel for the
accused must bring to the trial judge's attention at the earliest opportunity
any failure of the Crown to comply with its duty to disclose of which counsel
becomes aware.  This will enable the trial judge to remedy any prejudice to the
accused if possible and thus avoid a new trial.

 

                   Initial disclosure
should occur before the accused is called upon to elect the mode of trial or
plead.  Subject to the Crown's discretion, all relevant information must be
disclosed, both that which the Crown intends to introduce into evidence and
that which it does not, and whether the evidence is inculpatory or
exculpatory.  All statements obtained from persons who have provided relevant
information to the authorities should be produced, even if they are not
proposed as Crown witnesses.  Where statements are not in existence, other
information such as notes should be produced.  If there are no notes, all
information in the prosecution's possession relating to any relevant evidence
the person could give should be supplied.

 

                   Crown counsel was
not justified in refusing disclosure here on the ground that the witness was
not worthy of credit:  whether the witness is credible is for the trial judge
to determine after hearing the evidence.  The trial judge ought to have
examined the statements.  Since the information withheld might have affected
the outcome of the trial, the failure to disclose impaired the right to make
full answer and defence.  There should be a new trial at which the statements
are produced.

//Sopinka J.//

 

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

 

                   Sopinka
J. -- This appeal raises
the issue of the Crown's obligation to make disclosure to the defence.  A
witness who gave evidence at the preliminary inquiry favourable to the accused
was subsequently interviewed by agents for the Crown.  Crown counsel decided not
to call the witness and would not produce the statements obtained at the
interview.  The trial judge refused an application by the defence for
disclosure on the ground that there was no obligation on the Crown to disclose
the statements.  The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment at trial and the
case is here with leave of this Court.

 

1.                Facts

 

                   The appellant was a
Calgary lawyer charged with appropriating certain financial instruments from a
client, one Jack Abrams.  The indictment charged thirteen counts of criminal
breach of trust contrary to s. 296 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34 (now s. 336 ), thirteen counts of theft contrary to s. 294(a) (now
s. 334 (a)) of the Code, and one count of fraud contrary to s.
338(1)(a) (now s. 380(1) (a)) of the Code.  The trial in
the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench was before Brennan J. without a jury. 

 

                   The Crown alleged
that the appellant had wrongfully appropriated property which he held in trust
for Abrams.  The defence did not contest the receipt of funds by the
appellant.  The defence did contend, however, that despite Stinchcombe's formal
status as trustee of the property, Abrams had in fact made Stinchcombe his
business partner.  Under this theory, Stinchcombe had acted as he was legally
entitled to act.  At issue therefore was the actual, as opposed to the formal,
nature of the relationship between the two men.

 

                   Patricia Lineham is
a former secretary of Mr. Stinchcombe.  She was a Crown witness at the
preliminary inquiry.  There, she gave evidence which was, apparently, very
favourable to the defence regarding the conduct of Abrams.  The precise content
of this testimony was not before the trial judge and is not in the record. 
Lineham was not listed on the indictment, but was subpoenaed by the Crown.

 

                   After the
preliminary inquiry but prior to the trial, Lineham was interviewed by an RCMP
officer.  A tape-recorded statement was taken.  Crown counsel informed defence
counsel of the existence but not the content of this statement.  A request for
disclosure was refused.  Later, during the course of the trial, Lineham was
again interviewed by a police officer and a written statement taken.  Again,
though defence counsel was advised of the existence of the statement, a request
for disclosure was refused.  Crown counsel also indicated that he would not be
calling Lineham as she was not worthy of credit.

 

                   It was not until
the third day of the trial that defence counsel learned conclusively that
Lineham would not be called by the Crown.  At this time, he moved before the
trial judge for an order that (i) the Crown call the witness, or (ii) the Court
call the witness, or (iii) the Crown disclose the contents of the statements to
the defence.  A review of the record makes it clear that defence counsel was
pressing for access to, or production of, both the tape-recorded and written
statements and was not pressing the alternative requests.  In support of this
motion, counsel for the defendant indicated that Ms. Lineham refused to speak
to him or his staff when they attempted to interview her about the contents of
the statements.  Crown counsel did not provide any basis for resisting
production other than to say that in his view the potential witness was not
worthy of credit.

 

                   The trial judge
dismissed the application.  Brennan J. ruled that under the circumstances there
was no obligation on the Crown to call the witness and that there was no
obligation on the Crown to disclose the contents of the statements.  The trial
proceeded, and the accused was found guilty of all twenty-seven counts
charged.  A conditional stay was entered with respect to the thirteen theft
counts.  The Alberta Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal from conviction
without issuing reasons.  Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on the
disclosure issue.

 

                   During argument
before this Court, an application was made by the Crown to adduce the
statements and the tape as fresh evidence.  This application was rejected.  The
principal basis for the rejection was that at this stage it would be impossible
to determine whether the statements would have been material to the defence if
produced at trial.

 

2.                Crown's
Obligation to Disclose

 

                   The circumstances
which give rise to this case are testimony to the fact that the law with
respect to the duty of the Crown to disclose is not settled.  A number of cases
have addressed some aspects of the subject.  See, for example, Cunliffe v.
Law Society of British Columbia (1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 67 (B.C.C.A.); Savion
v. The Queen (1980), 13 C.R. (3d) 259 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Bourget
(1987), 56 C.R. (3d) 97 (Sask. C.A.).  No case in this Court has made a
comprehensive examination of the subject.  The Law Reform Commission of Canada,
in a 1974 working paper titled Criminal Procedure: Discovery (the
""1974 Working Paper"") and a 1984 report titled Disclosure by the
Prosecution (the ""1984 Report""), recommended comprehensive
schemes regulating disclosure by the Crown but no legislative action has been
taken implementing the proposals.  Apart from the limited legislative response
contained in s. 603  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , enacted
in the 1953-54 overhaul of the Code (which itself condensed pre-existing
provisions), legislators have been content to leave the development of the law
in this area to the courts.

 

                   Production and
discovery were foreign to the adversary process of adjudication in its earlier
history when the element of surprise was one of the accepted weapons in the
arsenal of the adversaries.  This applied to both criminal and civil
proceedings.  Significantly, in civil proceedings this aspect of the adversary
process has long since disappeared, and full discovery of documents and oral examination
of parties and even witnesses are familiar features of the practice.  This
change resulted from acceptance of the principle that justice was better served
when the element of surprise was eliminated from the trial and the parties were
prepared to address issues on the basis of complete information of the case to
be met.  Surprisingly, in criminal cases in which the liberty of the subject is
usually at stake, this aspect of the adversary system has lingered on.  While
the prosecution bar has generally co-operated in making disclosure on a
voluntary basis, there has been considerable resistance to the enactment of
comprehensive rules which would make the practice mandatory.  This may be
attributed to the fact that proposals for reform in this regard do not provide
for reciprocal disclosure by the defence (see 1974 Working Paper at pp. 29-31;
1984 Report at pp. 13-15; Marshall Commission Report, infra, Vol. 1, at
pp. 242-44). 

 

                   It is difficult to
justify the position which clings to the notion that the Crown has no legal
duty to disclose all relevant information.  The arguments against the existence
of such a duty are groundless while those in favour, are, in my view,
overwhelming.  The  suggestion that the duty should be reciprocal may deserve
consideration by this Court in the future but is not a valid reason for
absolving the Crown of its duty.  The contrary contention fails to take account
of the fundamental difference in the respective roles of the prosecution and
the defence.  In Boucher v. The Queen, [1955] S.C.R. 16, Rand J. states,
at pp. 23-24:

 

                   It
cannot be over-emphasized that the purpose of a criminal prosecution is not to
obtain a conviction, it is to lay before a jury what the Crown considers to be
credible evidence relevant to what is alleged to be a crime.  Counsel have a
duty to see that all available legal proof of the facts is presented:  it
should be done firmly and pressed to its legitimate strength but it must also
be done fairly.  The role of prosecutor excludes any notion of winning or
losing; his function is a matter of public duty than which in civil life there
can be none charged with greater personal responsibility.  It is to be
efficiently performed with an ingrained sense of the dignity, the seriousness
and the justness of judicial proceedings.

 

                   I would add that
the fruits of the investigation which are in the possession of counsel for the
Crown are not the property of the Crown for use in securing a conviction but
the property of the public to be used to ensure that justice is done.  In
contrast, the defence has no obligation to assist the prosecution and is
entitled to assume a purely adversarial role toward the prosecution.  The
absence of a duty to disclose can, therefore, be justified as being consistent
with this role.

 

                   Other grounds
advanced by advocates of the absence of a general duty to disclose all relevant
information are that it would impose onerous new obligations on the Crown
prosecutors resulting in increased delays in bringing accused persons to
trial.  This ground is not supported by the material in the record.  As I have
already observed, disclosure is presently being made on a voluntary basis.  The
extent of disclosure varies from province to province, from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction and from prosecutor to prosecutor.  The  adoption of uniform,
comprehensive rules for disclosure by the Crown would add to the work-load of
some Crown counsel but this would be offset by the time saved which is now
spent resolving disputes such as this one surrounding the extent of the Crown's
obligation and dealing with matters that take the defence by surprise.  In the
latter case an adjournment is frequently the result of non-disclosure or more
time is taken by a defence counsel who is not prepared.  There is also compelling
evidence that much time would be saved and therefore delays reduced by reason
of the increase in guilty pleas, withdrawal of charges and shortening or waiver
of preliminary hearings.  The 1984 Report (at pp. 6-9) refers to several
experimental projects which were established after the publication of the 1974
Working Paper in order to test the viability of pre-trial disclosure.  The
result of these experiments, and in particular the Montreal experiment, which
was the most exhaustively evaluated, was that there was a significant increase
in the number of cases settled and pleas of guilty entered or charges
withdrawn.

 

                   In England, under
the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 (U.K.), 1967, c. 80, a
""packet"" of material is furnished to defence counsel.  The provision
of such material has led to a reduction in the length and number of preliminary
hearings in that jurisdiction:  Report of the Special Committee on
Preliminary Hearings, Bench and Bar Council of Ontario (1982), at pp.
12-15.

 

                   Refusal to disclose
is also justified on the ground that the material will be used to enable the
defence to tailor its evidence to conform with information in the Crown's
possession.  For example, a witness may change his or her testimony to conform
with a previous statement given to the police or counsel for the Crown.  I am
not impressed with this submission.  All forms of discovery are subject to this
criticism.  There is surely nothing wrong in a witness refreshing his or her
memory from a previous statement or document.  The witness may even change his
or her evidence as a result.  This may rob the cross-examiner of a substantial
advantage but fairness to the witness may require that a trap not be laid by
allowing the witness to testify without the benefit of seeing contradictory
writings which the prosecutor holds close to the vest.  The principle has been
accepted that the search for truth is advanced rather than retarded by
disclosure of all relevant material.

 

                   Finally, it is
suggested that disclosure may put at risk the security and safety of persons
who have provided the prosecution with information.  No doubt measures must
occasionally be taken to protect the identity of witnesses and informers. 
Protection of the identity of informers is covered by the rules relating to
informer privilege and exceptions thereto (see Marks v. Beyfus (1890),
25 Q.B.D. 494 (C.A.); R. v. Scott, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 979), and any rules
with respect to disclosure would be subject to this and other rules of
privilege.  With respect to witnesses, persons who have information that may be
evidence favourable to the accused will have to have their identity disclosed
sooner or later.  Even the identity of an informer is subject to this fact of
life by virtue of the ""innocence exception"" to the informer privilege
rule (Marks v. Beyfus, supra, at pp. 498-99; R. v. Scott, supra,
at p. 996; Bisaillon v. Keable, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 60, at p. 93; Solicitor
General of Canada v. Royal Commission of Inquiry (Health Records in Ontario),
[1981] 2 S.C.R. 494).  It will, therefore, be a matter of the timing of the
disclosure rather than whether disclosure should be made at all.  The
prosecutor must retain a degree of discretion in respect of these matters.  The
discretion, which will be subject to review, should extend to such matters as
excluding what is clearly irrelevant, withholding the identity of persons to
protect them from harassment or injury, or to enforce the privilege relating to
informers.  The discretion would also extend to the timing of disclosure in
order to complete an investigation.  I shall return to this subject later in
these reasons.

 

                   This review of the
pros and cons with respect to disclosure by the Crown shows that there is no
valid practical reason to support the position of the opponents of a broad duty
of disclosure.  Apart from the practical advantages to which I have referred,
there is the overriding concern that failure to disclose impedes the ability of
the accused to make full answer and defence.  This common law right has
acquired new vigour by virtue of its inclusion in s. 7  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  as one of the principles of fundamental
justice.  (See Dersch v. Canada (Attorney General), [1990] 2 S.C.R.
1505, at p. 1514.)  The right to make full answer and defence is one of the
pillars of criminal justice on which we heavily depend to ensure that the
innocent are not convicted.  Recent events have demonstrated that the erosion
of this right due to non-disclosure was an important factor in the conviction
and incarceration of an innocent person.  In the Royal Commission on the
Donald Marshall, Jr., Prosecution, Vol. 1:  Findings and Recommendations
(1989) (the ""Marshall Commission Report""), the Commissioners found
that prior inconsistent statements were not disclosed to the defence.  This was
an important contributing factor in the miscarriage of justice which occurred
and led the Commission to state that ""anything less than complete disclosure
by the Crown falls short of decency and fair play"" (Vol. 1 at p. 238). 
The Commission recommended an extensive regime of disclosure of which the key
provisions are as follows (Vol. 1 at p. 243):

 

2(1)  Without request, the accused is
entitled, before being called upon to elect the mode of trial or to plead to
the charge of an indictable offence, whichever comes first, and thereafter:

 

(a)  to receive a copy of his criminal
record;

 

(b)  to receive a copy of any
statement made by him to a person in authority and recorded in writing or to
inspect such a statement if it has been recorded by electronic means; and to be
informed of the nature and content of any verbal statement alleged to have been
made by the accused to a person in authority and to be supplied with any
memoranda in existence pertaining thereto;

 

(c)  to inspect anything that the
prosecutor proposes to introduce as an exhibit and, where practicable, receive
copies thereof;

 

(d)  to receive a copy of any
statement made by a person whom the prosecutor proposes to call as a witness or
anyone who may be called as a witness, and recorded in writing or, in the
absence of a statement, a written summary of the anticipated testimony of the
proposed witness, or anyone who may be called as a witness;

 

(e)  to receive any other material or
information known to the Crown and which tends to mitigate or negate the
defendant's guilt as to the offence charged, or which would tend to reduce his
punishment therefor, notwithstanding that the Crown does not intend to
introduce such material or information as evidence;

 

(f)  to inspect the electronic
recording of any statement made by a person whom the prosecutor proposes to
call as a witness;

 

(g)  to receive a copy of the criminal
record of any proposed witness; and

 

(h)  to receive, where not protected
from disclosure by the law, the name and address of any other person who may
have information useful to the accused, or other details enabling that person
to be identified.

 

2(2)  The disclosure contemplated in
subsection (1), paragraphs (d), (e) and (h) shall be provided by the Crown and
may be limited only where, upon an inter partes application by the prosecutor,
supported by evidence showing a likelihood that such disclosure will endanger
the life or safety of such person or interfere with the administration of
justice, a justice having jurisdiction in the matter deems it just and proper.

 

                   In my opinion there
is a wholly natural evolution of the law in favour of disclosure by the Crown
of all relevant material.  As long ago as 1951, Cartwright J. stated in Lemay
v. The King, [1952] 1 S.C.R. 232, at p. 257:

 

                   I
wish to make it perfectly clear that I do not intend to say anything which
might be regarded as lessening the duty which rests upon counsel for the
Crown to bring forward evidence of every material fact known to the prosecution
whether favourable to the accused or otherwise....  [Emphasis added.]

 

This statement may have been in
reference to the obligation resting on counsel for the Crown to call evidence
rather than to disclose the material to the defence, but I see no reason why
this obligation should not be discharged by disclosing the material to the
defence rather than obliging the Crown to make it part of the Crown's case. 
Indeed, some of the information will be in a form that cannot be put in
evidence by the Crown but can be used by the defence in cross-examination or
otherwise.  Production to the defence is then the only way in which the
injunction of Cartwright J. can be obeyed.

 

                   In R. v. C.
(M.H.) (1988), 46 C.C.C. (3d) 142 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 155, McEachern C.J.B.C.
after a review of the authorities stated what I respectfully accept as a
correct statement of the law.  He said that:  ""there is a general duty on
the part of the Crown to disclose all material it proposes to use at trial and
especially all evidence which may assist the accused even if the Crown does not
propose to adduce it"".  This passage was cited with approval by McLachlin
J. in her reasons on behalf of the Court ([1991] 1 S.C.R. 763).  She went on to
add:  ""This Court has previously stated that the Crown is under a duty at
common law to disclose to the defence all material evidence whether favourable
to the accused or not"" (p. 774).

 

                   As indicated
earlier, however, this obligation to disclose is not absolute.  It is subject
to the discretion of counsel for the Crown.  This discretion extends both to
the withholding of information and to the timing of disclosure.  For example,
counsel for the Crown has a duty to respect the rules of privilege.  In the
case of informers the Crown has a duty to protect their identity.  In some
cases serious prejudice or even harm may result to a person who has supplied
evidence or information to the investigation.  While it is a harsh reality of
justice that ultimately any person with relevant evidence must appear to
testify, the discretion extends to the timing and manner of disclosure in such
circumstances.  A discretion must also be exercised with respect to the
relevance of information.  While the Crown must err on the side of inclusion,
it need not produce what is clearly irrelevant.  The experience to be gained
from the civil side of the practice is that counsel, as officers of the court
and acting responsibly, can be relied upon not to withhold pertinent
information.  Transgressions with respect to this duty constitute a very
serious breach of legal ethics. The initial obligation to separate ""the
wheat from the chaff"" must therefore rest with Crown counsel.  There may
also be situations in which early disclosure may impede completion of an
investigation.  Delayed disclosure on this account is not to be encouraged and
should be rare.  Completion of the investigation before proceeding with the
prosecution of a charge or charges is very much within the control of the
Crown.  Nevertheless, it is not always possible to predict events which may
require an investigation to be re-opened and the Crown must have some
discretion to delay disclosure in these circumstances.

 

                   The discretion of
Crown counsel is, however, reviewable by the trial judge.  Counsel for the
defence can initiate a review when an issue arises with respect to the exercise
of the Crown's discretion.  On a review the Crown must justify its refusal to
disclose.  Inasmuch as disclosure of all relevant information is the general
rule, the Crown must bring itself within an exception to that rule.

 

                   The trial judge on
a review should be guided by the general principle that information ought not
to be withheld if there is a reasonable possibility that the withholding of
information will impair the right of the accused to make full answer and
defence, unless the non-disclosure is justified by the law of privilege.  The
trial judge might also, in certain circumstances, conclude that the recognition
of an existing privilege does not constitute a reasonable limit on the
constitutional right to make full answer and defence and thus require
disclosure in spite of the law of privilege.  The trial judge may also review
the decision of the Crown to withhold or delay production of information by
reason of concern for the security or safety of witnesses or persons who have
supplied information to the investigation.  In such circumstances, while much
leeway must be accorded to the exercise of the discretion of the counsel for
the Crown with respect to the manner and timing of the disclosure, the absolute
withholding of information which is relevant to the defence can only be
justified on the basis of the existence of a legal privilege which excludes the
information from disclosure.

 

                   The trial judge may
also review the Crown's exercise of discretion as to relevance and interference
with the investigation to ensure that the right to make full answer and defence
is not violated.  I am confident that disputes over disclosure will arise
infrequently when it is made clear that counsel for the Crown is under a
general duty to disclose all relevant information.  The tradition of
Crown counsel in this country in carrying out their role as ""ministers of
justice"" and not as adversaries has generally been very high.  Given this
fact, and the obligation on defence counsel as officers of the court to act
responsibly, these matters will usually be resolved without the intervention of
the trial judge.  When they do arise, the trial judge must resolve them.  This
may require not only submissions but the inspection of statements and other
documents and indeed, in some cases, viva voce evidence.  A voir dire
will frequently be the appropriate procedure in which to deal with these
matters.

 

                   Counsel for the
accused must bring to the attention of the trial judge at the earliest
opportunity any failure of the Crown to comply with its duty to disclose of
which counsel becomes aware.  Observance of this rule will enable the trial
judge to remedy any prejudice to the accused if possible and thus avoid a new
trial.  See Caccamo v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 786.  Failure to do so
by counsel for the defence will be an important factor in determining on appeal
whether a new trial should be ordered. 

 

                   These are the
general principles that govern the duty of the Crown to make disclosure to the
defence.  There are many details with respect to their application that remain
to be worked out in the context of concrete situations.  It would be neither
possible nor appropriate to attempt to lay down precise rules here. Although
the basic principles of disclosure will apply across the country, the details
may vary from province to province and even within a province by reason of
special local conditions and practices.  It would, therefore, be useful if the
under-utilized power conferred by s. 482  of the Criminal Code  which
empowers superior courts and courts of criminal jurisdiction to enact rules
were employed to provide further details with respect to the procedural aspects
of disclosure.

 

                   The general
principles referred to herein arise in the context of indictable offences. 
While it may be argued that the duty of disclosure extends to all offences,
many of the factors which I have canvassed may not apply at all or may apply
with less impact in summary conviction offences.  Moreover, the content of the
right to make full answer and defence entrenched in s. 7  of the Charter 
may be of a more limited nature.  A decision as to the extent to which the
general principles of disclosure extend to summary conviction offences should
be left to a case in which the issue arises in such proceedings.  In view of
the number and variety of statutes which create such offences, consideration
would have to be given as to where to draw the line.  Pending a decision on
that issue, the voluntary disclosure which has been taking place through the
co-operation of Crown counsel will no doubt continue.  Continuation and
extension of this practice may eliminate the necessity for a decision on the
issue by this Court.

 

                   There are, however,
two additional matters which require further elaboration of the general
principles of disclosure outlined above.  They are:  (1) the timing of
disclosure, and (2) what should be disclosed.  Some detail with respect to
these issues is essential if the duty to disclose is to be meaningful. 
Moreover, with respect to the second matter, resolution of the dispute over
disclosure in this case requires a closer examination of the issue.

 

                   With respect to
timing, I agree with the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission of Canada
in both of its reports that initial disclosure should occur before the accused
is called upon to elect the mode of trial or to plead.  These are crucial steps
which the accused must take which affect his or her rights in a fundamental
way.  It will be of great assistance to the accused to know what are the
strengths and weaknesses of the Crown's case before committing on these
issues.  As I have pointed out above, the system will also profit from early
disclosure as it will foster the resolution of many charges without trial,
through increased numbers of withdrawals and pleas of guilty.  The obligation
to disclose will be triggered by a request by or on behalf of the accused. 
Such a request may be made at any time after the charge.  Provided the request
for disclosure has been timely, it should be complied with so as to enable the
accused sufficient time before election or plea to consider the information. 
In the rare cases in which the accused is unrepresented, Crown counsel should
advise the accused of the right to disclosure and a plea should not be taken
unless the trial judge is satisfied that this has been done.  At this stage,
the Crown's brief will often not be complete and disclosure will be limited by
this fact.  Nevertheless, the obligation to disclose is a continuing one and
disclosure must be completed when additional information is received.

 

                   With respect to
what should be disclosed, the general principle to which I have referred is
that all relevant information must be disclosed subject to the reviewable
discretion of the Crown.  The material must include not only that which the
Crown intends to introduce into evidence but also that which it does not.  No
distinction should be made between inculpatory and exculpatory evidence.  The
attempt to make this distinction in connection with the confession rule proved
to be unworkable and was eventually discarded by this Court.  See Piché v.
The Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 23, at p. 36; Rothman v. The Queen, [1981]
1 S.C.R. 640, at p. 645.  To re-introduce the distinction here would lead to
interminable controversy at trial that should be avoided.  The Crown must,
therefore, disclose relevant material whether it is inculpatory or exculpatory.

 

                   A special problem
arises in respect to witness statements and is specifically raised in this
case.  There is virtually no disagreement that statements in the possession of
the Crown obtained from witnesses it proposes to call should be  produced.  In
some cases the statement will simply be recorded in notes taken by an
investigator, usually a police officer.  The notes or copies should be
produced.  If notes do not exist then a ""will say"" statement,
summarizing the anticipated evidence of the witness, should be produced based
on the information in the Crown's possession.  A more difficult issue is posed
with respect to witnesses and other persons whom the Crown does not propose to
call.  In its 1974 Working Paper, the Law Reform Commission of Canada
recommended disclosure of not only the names, addresses and occupations of all
""persons who have provided information to investigation or prosecution
authorities"" (p. 41), but the statements obtained or, if these did not
exist, ""a summary of the information provided by those persons not
intended to be called at trial, along  with  a statement of the manner in which
the information in each summary has been obtained..."" (p. 41).  In its
1984 Report, the Commission seemed to have changed its mind.  It stated (at pp.
27-28):

 

                   With
respect to potential witnesses we do not recommend, on a mandatory basis, the
type of thorough disclosure that we recommend with respect to proposed
witnesses.  Complete disclosure would entail not only the identification of
such persons, but the disclosure of any statement they made and in some cases
their criminal records.  In our view a recommendation to this effect would be
excessive and disproportionate to the needs of the defence.  In many instances
these people are of no use, or of marginal use, to the case for either side. 
Their statements are not evidence, although they may be effectively used by the
prosecution for purposes of impeachment in cross-examination in the event the
witness is called by the accused.  Prosecutors are understandably reluctant to
disclose these statements because to do so would imperil their principal
utility.  It is our view that the interests of the defence are adequately
served by the mandatory disclosure of the identity of such persons, although we
would not wish our comments to discourage prosecutors from disclosing
statements and other relevant information on a voluntary basis.

 

                   The Marshall
Commission Report recommended disclosure of ""any statement made by a
person whom the prosecutor proposes to call as a witness or anyone who may be
called as a witness"".  Although not entirely clear, this recommendation
appears to extend to anyone who has relevant information and who is either
compellable or prepared to testify whether proposed to be called by the Crown
or not.

 

                   This Court, in R.
v. C. (M.H.), supra, dealt with the failure to disclose either the
identity or statement of a person who provided relevant information to the
police but who was not called as a witness.  McLachlin J., speaking for the
Court, indicated that failure to disclose in such cases could impair the
fairness of the trial.

 

                   I am of the opinion
that, subject to the discretion to which I have referred above, all statements
obtained from persons who have provided relevant information to the authorities
should be produced notwithstanding that they are not proposed as Crown
witnesses.  Where statements are not in existence, other information such as
notes should be produced, and, if there are no notes, then in addition to the
name, address and occupation of the witness, all information in the possession
of the prosecution relating to any relevant evidence that the person could give
should be supplied.  I do not find the comments of the Commission in its 1984
Report persuasive.  If the information is of no use then presumably it is
irrelevant and will be excluded in the exercise of the discretion of the
Crown.  If the information is of some use then it is relevant and the
determination as to whether it is sufficiently useful to put into evidence
should be made by the defence and not the prosecutor.  Moreover, I do not
understand the Commission's statement that ""[t]heir statements are not
evidence"".  That is true of all witness statements.  They themselves are not
evidence but are produced not because they will be put in evidence in that form
but will enable the evidence to be called viva voce.  That prosecutors
are reluctant to disclose statements because use of them in cross-examination
is thereby rendered less effective is understandable.  That is an objection to
all forms of discovery and disclosure.  Tactical advantage must be sacrificed
in the interests of fairness and the ascertainment of the true facts of the
case.

 

3.  Application to This Case

 

                   No request was made
in this case for disclosure prior to pleading or electing the mode of trial and
this issue does not, therefore, arise.  A request for disclosure was made
during the trial for the disclosure of two statements taken subsequent to the
preliminary hearing.  An application for disclosure was dismissed by the trial
judge on the ground that there was no obligation on the Crown to disclose the
statements.

 

                   Applying the above
principles, I conclude that the following errors were committed:

 

(1)Counsel
for the Crown misconceived his obligation to disclose the statements;

 

(2)The
explanation for refusal that the witness was not worthy of credit was
completely inadequate to support the exercise of this discretion on the ground
of irrelevance.  Whether the witness is credible is for the trial judge to
determine after hearing the evidence;

 

(3)The
trial judge ought to have examined the statements.  The suggestion that this
would have prejudiced the trial judge is without merit.  Trial judges are
frequently apprised of evidence which is ruled inadmissible.  One example is a
confession that fails to meet the test of voluntariness.  No one would suggest
that knowledge of such evidence prejudices the trial judge.  We operate on the
principle that a judge trained to screen out inadmissible evidence will
disabuse himself or herself of such evidence;

 

(4)The
trial judge erred in his statement of the duty to disclose on the part of the
Crown.

 

                   It was submitted
that the appellant was not deprived of the opportunity to make full answer and
defence because he could have:

 

(a)interviewed
the witness and obtained his own statement;

 

(b)called
the witness, and if her evidence proved adverse, cross-examined on the basis of
the preliminary hearing transcript.

 

                   With respect to
(a), counsel for the appellant pointed out that the witness refused to be
interviewed.  In any event, even if such an interview took place, what the
witness said on two prior occasions could be very material to the defence.

 

                   As for (b), counsel
for the defence is entitled to know whether the witness he/she is calling will
give evidence that will assist the defence or whether the witness will be
adverse and necessitate an application to cross-examine on the basis of a prior
inconsistent statement.  The latter usually creates an undesirable atmosphere
at the trial and the most that can be achieved is to impeach or destroy the
credibility of the witness.  See McInroy v. The Queen, [1979] 1 S.C.R.
588, and R. v. Mannion, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 272, at pp. 277-78.  Most
counsel faced with this prospect would likely opt not to call the witness, a
matter which bears on the right to make full answer and defence.

 

                   What are the legal
consequences flowing from the failure to disclose?  In my opinion, when a court
of appeal is called upon to review a failure to disclose, it must consider
whether such failure impaired the right to make full answer and defence.  This
in turn depends on the nature of the information withheld and whether it might
have affected the outcome.  As McLachlin J. put it in R. v. C. (M.H.), supra,
at. p. 776:

 

Had
counsel for the appellant been aware of this statement, he might well have
decided to use it in support of the defence that the evidence of the
complainant was a fabrication.  In my view, that evidence could conceivably
have affected the jury's conclusions on the only real issue, the respective
credibility of the complainant and the appellant.

 

                   In this case, we
are told that the witness gave evidence at the preliminary hearing favourable
to the defence.  The subsequent statements were not produced and therefore we
have no indication from the trial judge as to whether they were favourable or
unfavourable.  Examination of the statements, which were tendered as fresh
evidence in this Court, should be carried out at trial so that counsel for the
defence, in the context of the issues in the case and the other evidence, can
explain what use might be made of them by the defence.  In the circumstances,
we must assume that non-production of the statements was an important factor in
the decision not to call the witness.  The absence of this evidence might very
well have affected the outcome.

 

                   Accordingly, I
would allow the appeal and direct a new trial at which the statements should be
produced.

acquitted at trial ‑‑ Whether or not accused should be allowed to withdraw
plea.

 

                   Respondent was
committed for trial together with Marshall, as co‑accused, on charges of
unlawful confinement and sexual assault.  Shortly before the trial was to take
place he entered a guilty plea on an indictment for unlawful confinement.  A
jury acquitted Marshall of both counts.  At issue here was whether the
respondent should be allowed to withdraw his plea in the light of that
acquittal.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
set aside the respondent's plea of guilty and substituted an acquittal.  The majority
agreed that there were no other grounds upon which to permit the change of
plea.  They concluded, however, that the basis of the charge was that the
appellant (in the Court of Appeal) aided and abetted the co‑accused in
confining the complainant and decided that the conviction could not stand as it
would be a mistake to say that the respondent aided and abetted Marshall in the
commission of a criminal offence when Marshall had not committed the offence. 
The Crown appealed as of right.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   The facts supported
the conviction of respondent as a principal to the offence of unlawful
confinement.  This characterization was a question of law because it involved
the legal effect of undisputed or found facts.  The acquittal of the co‑accused
determined nothing in respect of the conviction of the accused.  The jury
verdict is only conclusive as between the Crown and the accused at that trial. 
It followed, then, that the majority's conclusion that the conviction could not
stand was erroneous.

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

 

                   Stevenson
J. -- Crown appeals, as
of right, a decision of the Court of Appeal  of British Columbia setting aside
the accused's plea of guilty to a charge of unlawful confinement and
substituting an acquittal.  The appeal is based on the dissent of Gibbs J.A.
who would have dismissed the accused's appeal. 

 

                   The accused had
been committed for trial together with one, Marshall, on charges of unlawful
confinement and sexual assault but shortly before the trial was to take place
he entered a guilty plea on an indictment alleging that he had committed the
offence of unlawful confinement.  At trial a jury acquitted Marshall of both
counts.  The appeal involved a consideration of whether the accused should be
allowed to withdraw his plea in the light of that acquittal.

 

                   The majority agreed
that there were no other grounds upon which to permit the change of plea. The
accused should not be allowed to withdraw his plea on the basis of an alleged
factual dispute between the Crown and the defence or on the ground that the
trial judge wrongly relied on evidence taken at the preliminary inquiry.  The
majority concluded that the basis of the charge was that the appellant aided
and abetted Marshall in confining the complainant so that Marshall could have
sexual intercourse with her against her will. The majority decided on the basis
of R. v. Rowley, [1948] 1 All E.R. 570, that the conviction ""cannot
stand"" as ""it would be a mistake to say that the [accused] aided and
abetted Marshall in the commission of a criminal offence when Marshall had not
committed the offence.""

 

                   Gibbs J.A.
disagreed.  After finding no other valid ground to justify a change of plea (Adgey
v. The Queen, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 426), he turned to consider Rowley
which involved an accused charged as an accessory after the fact.  He
distinguished Rowley, which apparently had not been discussed in
argument before the court, on the basis that it was irrelevant in a case in
which the accused was not charged with aiding and abetting.  Gibbs J.A. had set
out the agreed statement of facts and noted no factual dispute, a proposition
with which the majority agreed.  The agreed statement of facts read:

 

Keith
Hick and Allen Marshall picked up the victim and a male friend and drove out to
Otway Road after having drinks together.  Upon arriving at an isolated area
Marshall instructs Hick to get rid of the boyfriend and Hick runs towards the
friend and throws things and the male friend runs away.  Marshall then rapes
the victim while Hick drives the car.  After Marshall is finished, Hick makes a
movement towards the girl, she says ""You'll have to kill me first"",
Hick then withdraws.  Marshall takes over driving and puts the car in the
ditch.

 

In
the meantime the male friend is able to contact the police and they come to
across [sic] the car in the ditch and Hick and Marshall are arrested. 
Hick has blood alcohol reading of .140 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres
of blood.

 

                   In my view the
difference between the majority and Gibbs J.A. depends upon characterizing the
facts.  The facts support the conviction of the accused as a principal to the
offence of unlawful confinement.  That characterization is a question of law
because it involves the legal effect of undisputed or found facts:  R. v. B.
(G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 57, at p. 71.  In my view Gibbs J.A. was
correct.

 

                   Without expressing
any opinion on its correctness Rowley does not purport to apply to
principals and in my view cannot be applied to them.  The acquittal of Marshall
determines nothing in respect of the conviction of the accused.  Rémillard
v. The King (1921), 62 S.C.R. 21, makes it perfectly clear that the jury
verdict is only conclusive as between the Crown and the accused at that trial. 
It follows, then, that the majority's conclusion that the conviction cannot
stand is  erroneous.

 

                   I would allow the
appeal, reinstate the conviction and return the matter to the Court of Appeal
to determine the sentence appeal which is still outstanding.

                   Appellant's
reporters videotaped a demonstration during which a company guardhouse was
destroyed.  Police, including identification specialists, were present.  The
RCMP sought a search warrant to seize these tapes.  The sworn information or
affidavit in support of the warrant explained that other sources of information
existed but that they either provided insufficient evidence or were unavailable
or unwilling to testify.  The affidavit did not reveal that police
identification experts were present at the scene.  A justice of the peace
issued a search warrant on the basis of the affidavit.  The RCMP and
appellant's officials agreed that the videotapes should be placed in a sealed
envelope to be held by a judge of the Provincial Court until the outcome of
these proceedings.

 

                   Appellant
successfully brought an application in the Court of Queen's Bench to quash the
warrant and to order the return of the seized tapes.  The Court of Appeal
allowed the Crown's appeal and upheld the issuance of the warrant.  At issue
here was whether freedom of the press, as protected by s. 2 (b) of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , requires that a justice of
the peace, before issuing a warrant to search media offices, be satisfied that
no reasonable alternative source of the information exists.

 

                   Held (McLachlin J. dissenting):  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory and Stevenson
JJ.:  Freedom of expression, protected by s. 2 (b) of the Charter ,
does not import any new or additional requirements for the issuance of search
warrants.  It provides a backdrop against which the reasonableness of the
search may be evaluated and requires that careful consideration be given not
only to whether a warrant should issue but also to the conditions which might
properly be imposed upon any search of media premises.

 

                   Whether the search
of a media office can be considered reasonable will depend on a number of
factors including the nature of the objects to be seized, the manner in which
the search is to be conducted and the degree of urgency of the search.  In
particular, the justice of the peace must consider the effects of the search
and seizure on the ability of the particular media organization in question to
fulfil its function as a news gatherer and news disseminator.  If a search will
impede the media from fulfilling these functions and the impediments cannot
reasonably be controlled through the imposition of conditions on the execution
of the search warrant, then a warrant should only be issued where a compelling
state interest is demonstrated.  There must be no alternative source of
information available or, if there is, reasonable steps must have been taken to
obtain the information from that source.  Alternatively, the search might be
justified on the grounds of the gravity of the offence under investigation and
the urgent need to obtain the evidence expected to be revealed by the search.

 

                   The factors to be
weighed with regard to issuing a warrant to search any premises will vary with
the circumstances presented.  Two factors  -- whether other sources exist, and
whether reasonable efforts to obtain information from them have been exhausted
and proved unsuccessful -- had been identified in earlier jurisprudence as
being necessary to the issuance of a search warrant for press facilities.  It
is impossible, however, to isolate these two factors from the numerous
considerations which bear on assessment of the reasonableness of a search and
label them as conditional prerequisites.  The essential question is whether,
taking into account all the circumstances and viewing them fairly and
objectively, it can be said that the search was reasonable.

 

                   Less can be said
for refusing to make that material available to the police where the media have
fulfilled their role by gathering the news and publishing it.  Arguments based
on the ""drying up"" of the media's sources of information and on the
""chilling effect"" on their sources become more difficult to sustain
after the information has been released to the public.  Should it be necessary,
appropriate steps might be taken by the media to have the court determine what
protection could properly be obtained.

 

                   Section 8  of the
Charter  protects the overall reasonableness of a search.  The
potentially damaging effect of a search and seizure upon the freedom and the
functioning of the press is highly relevant to the assessment of the
reasonableness of the search.  Neither s. 2(b) nor s. 8  of the
Charter  requires that other sources of information be exhausted.  Some
flexibility in the balancing process must be preserved so that all the factors
relevant to the individual case may be taken into consideration and properly
weighed.

 

                   The following
factors should be considered in issuing a search warrant for media premises. 
(1) The requirements of s. 487(1) (b) of the Criminal Code 
must be met.  (2) The justice of the peace should then consider all of the
circumstances in determining whether to exercise his or her discretion to issue
a warrant and (3) ensure that a delicate balance is struck between the
competing interests of the state in the investigation and prosecution of crimes
and the right to privacy of the media in the course of their news gathering and
news dissemination.  The press is truly an innocent third party; this factor is
most important in attempting to strike an appropriate balance, including the
consideration of imposing conditions on that warrant.  (4) The affidavit in
support of the application must contain sufficient detail to enable a proper
exercise of discretion as to whether or not to issue a search warrant.  (5)
Although not constitutionally required, the affidavit material should
ordinarily disclose whether there are alternative sources, and if reasonable
and alternative sources exist, whether those sources have been investigated and
all reasonable efforts to obtain the information have been exhausted.  (6)
Dissemination of the information by the media in whole or in part will be a
factor favouring the issuance of the search warrant.  (7) If a justice of the
peace determines that a warrant should be issued for the search of media
premises, consideration should then be given to the imposition of some
conditions on its implementation.  (8) The search warrant may be found to be
invalid if, after its issuance, it is found that pertinent information was not
disclosed, or (9) if the search is unreasonably conducted.

 

                   Section 487  of
the Criminal Code  does no more than require that a justice of the peace,
before issuing a search warrant, be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds
to believe that something which will afford evidence with respect to the
commission of a crime will be found in the described premises.  The affidavit
here met these requirements.  The search did not impede the media's news
gathering function and did not violate s. 8  notwithstanding any deficiency
in the affidavit concerning alternative sources.  There was no finding of bad
faith with respect to the police affidavit which declared that alternative
sources were pursued but proved unsuccessful and there was nothing nefarious in
the failure to mention the presence of the identification officers at the
scene.

 

                   Per La Forest J.:  The appeal should be
dismissed for the reasons given in Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Lessard.

 

                   Per L'Heureux-Dubé J.:  The appeal should
be dismissed for the reasons expressed in Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v.
Lessard.

 

                   Per McLachlin J. (dissenting):  The legal
principles set out in Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Lessard apply
here.  The warrant violated the Charter  and cannot be upheld.  The
justice of the peace, in the absence of information as why other sources would
not dare to testify or could not be subpoenaed to testify, was not in a
position to determine if the issuance of the warrant was really necessary, or
whether it was justified given the violation of Charter  rights which it
entailed.

the factors that should be taken into account by a justice of the peace when

organization that is not implicated in the crime under investigation. 
Specifically, the Court must determine whether freedom of the press, as
protected by s. 2 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ,
requires that a justice of the peace, before issuing a warrant to search media
offices, be satisfied that no reasonable alternative source of the information
exists.

 

Factual Background

 

                   In early September
of 1988, demonstrations were held in the Kedgewick-St-Quentin regions of New
Brunswick to protest the policies of the Fraser Co., a large pulp and paper
concern.  On September 10, during one of those protests, Molotov cocktails were
thrown at a company guardhouse, setting it on fire.

 

                   While the police
had turned out in force during much of the demonstration, only a handful were
present when the guardhouse was ignited.  Among the remaining officers were
identification specialists.  As well, a number of police informers were
circulating among the crowd to help identify any wrongdoers.  As might be
expected, members of the media were on the scene, including reporters of the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (the CBC) who recorded much of the protest on
videotape.

 

                   Officer Marcel
Ouellette of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (the RCMP) swore an information
in support of an application for a search warrant to seize from the CBC tapes,
films and videocassettes recording the events of September 9 and 10, 1988 at
St-Quentin.  Officer Ouellette described the material to be seized as follows:

 

. .
. tapes, and/or films and/or videocassettes and/or portions of films or videotapes
commonly known as ""outs"" or ""out-takes"", the latter being
portions of tape or videocassette from a lengthier film or videocassette and
not subsequently used for transmission by the facility of Radio-Canada . . .

 

                   In his information,
officer Ouellette explained that while other sources of information existed,
they, for various reasons, either provided insufficient evidence or else were
unavailable or unwilling to testify.  It was set out in this way in the
information:

 

4) 
THAT all three informants have expressed fear for their own physical safety
which I do verily believe is reasonable in the circumstances in view of the
high tensions surrounding the disputes with Fraser Inc., such apprehension in
the view of your deponent is aptly justified.  All three informants live within
the area.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

10) 
THAT as a result of the information conveyed to me by Constables FORTIN and
GLADU earlier referred to which I do verily believe I have reasonable grounds
to believe that the information contained in the said film or portions thereof
will afford relevant evidences for the prosecution of a criminal offence,
evidence which would not otherwise be available due to:

 

                          (a)       The
considerable confusion at the scene;

 

(b)The
limited number of R.C.M.P. officers available at the time for identification
purposes;

 

(c)The
darkness and general visibility problems at the time preventing easy eye
witness identification by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

 

11) 
THAT alternative sources of information have been exhausted, such as the use of
informants as earlier referred to; the informants having made it very clear to
your deponent that they do not dare come forward and testify in court of law.

 

12) 
THAT despite considerable investigation effort in the area, no eye witnesses
are prepared to come forward and describe the events and give evidence against
the participants in the attempted and actual criminal activities.

 

13) 
THAT as the result of the three paragraphs above, your deponent does have
reason to believe and does believe that there are no other means available to
the police for obtaining evidences for the proper determination of possible
charges.

 

                   The information did
not reveal that police identification experts were also present at the scene. 
Relying upon the information of officer Ouellette, a justice of the peace
issued the requested search warrant on October 26, 1988.  The following day,
three RCMP officers attended at the offices of the CBC in Moncton.  The officers
and officials from the CBC agreed to place the videotapes in question in a
sealed envelope to be held by Judge McIntyre of the Provincial Court pending
the outcome of these proceedings.

 

                   On December 22,
1988, the CBC brought an application to quash the warrant and to order the
return of the seized tapes.  On April 7, 1989 Daigle J. quashed the warrant. 
On December 22, 1989 the Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal and upheld
the issuance of the warrant.

 

Judgments Below

 

Court of Queen's Bench (1989), 98 N.B.R. (2d) 306

 

                   Daigle J. found
that the information sworn by Ouellette met all of the explicit requirements of
s. 487(1) (b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 
(formerly s. 443(1) (b)).  In his opinion, therefore, in the ordinary
case, the information could properly form the basis for a decision authorizing
the requested search warrant.

 

                   He went on to hold,
however, that the Charter  required that further conditions be satisfied
when a warrant is sought to search the premises of a media organization.  In
reaching this conclusion, he relied on the decisions of the British Columbia
Supreme Court in Re Pacific Press Ltd. and The Queen (1977), 37 C.C.C.
(2d) 487 and of this Court in Descôteaux v. Mierzwinski, [1982] 1 S.C.R.
860, both of which I shall discuss below.  Although noting that these decisions
pre-dated the Charter , Daigle J. held that the two requirements set out
in Pacific Press had to be met in the present case; specifically, he
held that the warrant application must show that no alternative source of
information was available and if available, that reasonable steps were taken to
obtain the information from that source.  Daigle J. put his position in this
way (at p. 332):

 

[translation] I am therefore of the
opinion that the two conditions stated in Re Pacific Press Ltd. are the
minimal standards to be used by a justice of the peace when determining whether
to issue a warrant to ensure the protection of the freedom of the press such as
enjoyed by Société Radio-Canada in this matter.  Therefore, before allowing the
search of Radio-Canada offices to find evidence dealing with the commission of
offences, the Provincial Court judge, acting within her jurisdiction as
provided in s. 443(1)(b), should have, in order not to exceed her jurisdiction,
refused to issue the warrant unless she was convinced that no alternative
source of obtaining the evidence or information was available, and if
available, that reasonable steps had been taken to obtain the information and
evidence from that source.

 

                   In considering the
application of these principles to the present case, Daigle J. expressed his
concern that officer Ouellette had failed to refer to the presence of the
police identification experts at the scene.  Although he found that there was
no bad faith on the part of the police, he determined that the warrant should
be quashed on the basis that the police had failed to make full disclosure as
to possible alternative sources of information.

 

New Brunswick Court of Appeal (1989), 104 N.B.R. (2d) 1

 

                   Angers J.A., for
himself and Ayles J.A., held that the only conditions imposed on the issuance
of a warrant were those explicitly set out in s. 487  (formerly s. 443) of the Criminal
Code .  

 

                   Angers J.A.
expressed the view that in determining whether to issue a warrant, a justice of
the peace must consider the nature of the crime alleged, the probative value of
the item to be seized, the location of the requested search and the
consequences of the search on innocent parties.  It was his view that so long
as the justice of the peace had considered these factors, it was not essential
to review evidence as to the availability of alternative sources.  Angers J.A.
rejected the contention that the media are entitled to special consideration in
this regard and, therefore, concluded that the seizure of the tapes in this
case did not violate the freedom of press protected by s. 2 (b) of the Charter . 
He wrote (at p. 15):

 

                   [translation] In the instant case, the
evidence produced by the respondent only establishes an indirect relationship
and I would even say a speculative relationship between the seizure of
videocassettes and the drying-up of news sources.  At the limit, the argument
of the journalist would be that a criminal would not allow himself to be filmed
while committing a crime out of fear that the seizure of the film would allow
the police to identify him.

 

                   Rice J.A. wrote
concurring reasons.  In his opinion, it is not necessarily incumbent upon the
police to provide information concerning the availability of alternative
sources, although a justice of the peace would be entitled to refrain from
issuing a warrant if the police did not provide this information.  Rice J.A.
added that, in any event, any concern about a breach of the Charter 
should be addressed by the justice of the peace and not the reviewing judge.

 

Relevant Legislation

 

Section 487  (formerly s. 443) of the Criminal
Code  provides:

 

                   487. (1) A justice who is satisfied by
information on oath in Form 1 that there are reasonable grounds to believe that
there is in a building, receptacle or place

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(b)               anything
that there is reasonable ground to believe will afford evidence with respect to
the commission of an offence against this Act or any other Act or Parliament,

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

may
at any time issue a warrant under his hand authorizing a person named therein
or a peace officer

 

(d) 
to search the building, receptacle or place for any such thing and to seize it,
and

 

(e) 
subject to any other Act of Parliament, to, as soon as practicable, bring the
thing seized before, or make a report in respect thereof to, the justice or
some other justice for the same territorial division in accordance with section
489.1.

 

Requirements for Obtaining a Search
Warrant and the Discretion of the Issuing Officer

 

                   Section 487  of the Criminal
Code  sets out the only requirements which must be met for the issuance of a
search warrant.  They are but two.  It must be demonstrated that reasonable
grounds exist to believe 1) that there is in a building, receptacle or place;
2) something that will afford evidence with respect to the commission of an
offence against the Code or any other Act of Parliament.

 

                   The section, by the
use of the word ""may"", recognizes that the justice of the peace has a
discretion to determine whether to issue the warrant.  The two decisions
referred to above, one by the British Columbia Supreme Court and the other by
the Supreme Court of Canada, have discussed the nature of this discretion.

 

1.   Re Pacific Press Ltd. and The
Queen

 

                   In Pacific Press,
supra, journalists had observed individuals picketing and then occupying
the premises in which the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission was to hold an
inquiry.  The obstruction of an inquiry constitutes an offence under s. 41 of
the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-23.  Combines
Investigation officers contacted the editor of The Vancouver Sun, asking
for information as to the identity of the individuals involved in the picketing
and occupation.  The editor refused to provide this information.

 

                   Combines officers
then applied for a search warrant in order to obtain the desired information
from The Vancouver Sun and The Province, both of which were owned
by Pacific Press Limited.  The warrants were issued and served the next day. 
The search was conducted in the area where newspapers were being prepared for
publication.  Some 77 pieces of paper, a number of handwritten notes and 69
frames of negative film were seized together with a reporter's private
""contact book"" which contained a list of the names and addresses of
people who acted as sources of information for the newspapers.  In considering
the application of Pacific Press Ltd. to quash the warrant, Nemetz C.J.
observed, at p. 489, that ""[t]here is little doubt that the search
disrupted the operation of the newspapers and delayed the preparation and
publication of both newspapers that day.""

 

                   Nemetz C.J. found
that there was a defect in the search warrant for The Province which
rendered it invalid.  He then addressed the issue of whether, because The
Vancouver Sun was a press organization, a justice of the peace could issue
a warrant in the absence of proof that no reasonable alternative to the search
existed as a means of obtaining the desired evidence.  In considering this
question, Nemetz C.J. adopted a passage from the judgment of Lord Denning in Senior
v. Holdsworth, Ex parte Independent Television News Ltd., [1976] 1 Q.B. 23,
which recognizes the news media as occupying a ""special position"" in
relation to search warrants and, in particular, recognizes the difficult and
careful balancing required when freedom of the press rights collide with the
state interest in investigating and prosecuting crime through the use of search
warrants.

 

                   Expressing his
agreement with this view, Nemetz C.J. concluded at pp. 494-95:

 

                   Where,
then, does the matter stand in Canada?  Counsel for the petitioner submits that
Parliament has accorded the free press a special place under the Canadian
Bill of Rights.  Accordingly, he argues, ss. 1(f) and 2 , must be
taken into consideration and weighed by the Justice of the Peace before he
exercises his judicial discretion to grant the issuance of a search warrant
against an organ of the free press of this country.  A fortiori, he
says, this fact is to be weighed in cases where the premises of the newspaper
are not the premises of those persons accused of the crime.  I agree with this
submission.  Furthermore, he submits, it was wrong, in the circumstances, to
attempt to render the press an investigative arm of the State when other means
of obtaining the names of the persons involved in the melee at the combines
hearing may have been available.  In particular, counsel points to the fact
that many persons other than the newspaper people were in attendance at the
combines office on the days in question and the material does not show whether
these other people were approached to establish the identity of the participants
in the fracas.

 

                   The
issuing of any search warrant is a serious matter, especially when its issuance
against a newspaper may have, as it did, the effect of impeding its
publication.  To use the words of my distinguished predecessor in United
Distillers Ltd. (1948), 88 C.C.C. 338, [1947] 3 D.L.R. 900, the Justice of
the Peace ""should have reasonable information before him to entitle him to
judicially decide whether such warrant should issue or not"".  In my
opinion, no such reasonable information was before him since there was no
material to show:

 

1.whether
a reasonable alternative source of obtaining the information was or was not
available, and

 

2.if
available, that reasonable steps had been taken to obtain it from that
alternative source.

 

2.  Descôteaux v. Mierzwinski

 

                   In Descôteaux v.
Mierzwinski, supra, this Court considered whether a search which was
said to impinge upon solicitor-client privilege was permitted under what is now
s. 487  of the Criminal Code .  In that case, Mierzwinski had allegedly
lied to a lawyer at a legal aid clinic with respect to his finances.  At issue
was the validity of a search warrant to search the offices of the clinic to
find the form upon which Mierzwinski made his financial declaration.  Lamer J.,
as he then was, writing for the Court, found that since it was the financial
declaration itself which was alleged to be fraudulent, it was not subject to
solicitor-client privilege.

 

                   In the course of
his reasons, Lamer J. discussed the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace to
issue a search warrant and noted that the  jurisdiction did not, in any way,
depend on the nature of the premises to be searched.  That is to say, a search
could be authorized of any premises within a residence, lawyer's office or
media organization.

 

                   Lamer J. observed,
however, that a justice of the peace could lose jurisdiction if sufficient
protection were not given to the fundamental right of freedom of the press.  At
pages 889-91, he held:

 

                   The
justice of the peace, in my view, has the authority, where circumstances
warrant, to set out execution procedures in the search warrant; I would even go
so far as to say that he has the right to refuse to issue the warrant in
special circumstances, such as those found in Re Pacific Press Ltd. and The
Queen et al., supra.

 

                   That
case involved a search of a newspaper office for information gathered by the
newspaper staff.  Neither the newspaper staff nor the newspaper itself were
accused of having been involved in the commission of an offence.  In view of
the special situation of a newspaper in light of ss. 1(f) and 2 of the Canadian
Bill of Rights, R.S.C. 1970, Appendix III, Nemetz C.J. of the British
Columbia Supreme Court quashed the search warrant issued by the justice of the
peace . . .

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   It
could be advanced that the two conditions set out by Nemetz C.J. should be met
before a warrant is issued whenever a search is sought to be conducted, under
443(1)(b), of premises occupied by an innocent third party which are not
alleged by the information to be connected in any way with the crime.  It is
not necessary for purposes of this appeal to decide that point.  It is
sufficient to say that in situations such as the one in Re Pacific Press
Ltd., where the search would interfere with rights as fundamental as
freedom of the press, and, as in the case at bar, a lawyer's client's right to
confidentiality, the justice of the peace may and should refuse to issue the
warrant if these two conditions have not been met, lest he exceeds the
jurisdiction he had ab initio.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   From this I take it
that if the failure to meet these two conditions would interfere with the
freedom of the press, this could result in a loss of jurisdiction.  Such a
failure would not necessarily result in an automatic loss of jurisdiction.  It must
not be forgotten that in the Pacific Press case, the search
significantly interfered with the operations of the newspaper resulting in a
delay in publication of the news.  Today that same situation would require a
Court to take into consideration ss. 8  and 24  of the Charter .

 

                   The decisions in
both Descôteaux and Pacific Press recognized that a justice of
the peace has a discretion to determine whether to issue a search warrant.  In
exercising this discretion, a balance must be struck between the interests of
the state in investigating and prosecuting crime and the privacy interests of
the individual or body whose premises the state wishes to search.  Both cases
indicate that a proper balancing of these interests must involve a
consideration of the effects of the search on both the ability of the police to
proceed with their investigation and the ability of those being searched to
carry out their functions.

 

                   In Pacific Press,
the search disrupted the operation of a corporation which was not implicated in
the crime being investigated and delayed the publication of its newspaper. 
These factors weighed heavily in the determination that the search warrant was
not valid.  Perhaps the only circumstance which could have counterbalanced and
outweighed the serious interference with the operations of the media
organization was a demonstrated necessity to obtain the information.  This
necessity could have been demonstrated by establishing that:

 

 

                   1.no
other reasonable alternative source of obtaining the information was available,
or

 

2.if
an alternative source were available, that reasonable steps had been taken to
obtain the information from the alternative source and that they had been
proved unsuccessful.

 

Because these two factors were not
demonstrated on the information placed before the justice of the peace, Nemetz
C.J., on balancing all of the factors involved, held that the search warrant
should be quashed.

 

                   The  balancing of
interests is essential to the entire process involved in the issuance of search
warrants.  As Lamer J. noted in Descôteaux, the various interests must
not only be considered in determining whether a warrant should be issued, but
also in determining the form the warrant should take.  He wrote at p. 891:

 

                   Moreover,
even if the conditions are met, the justice of the peace must set out
procedures for the execution of the warrant that reconcile protection of the
interests this right is seeking to promote with protection of those the search
power is seeking to promote, and limit the breach of this fundamental right to
what is strictly inevitable.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

The Constitutional Protection of
Freedom of Expression

 

                   Any search of
premises is certain to be disquieting and upsetting.  The invasion of privacy
rights which a search entails is an important concern for all members of a
democratic society.  Some searches are obviously more intrusive and upsetting
than others.  For example, the search of a residence is likely to have graver
consequences than a search of commercial premises which may be subject to
statutory regulation and inspection.  Because of its intrusive nature, a
warrant to search any premises must only be issued when a justice of the peace
is satisfied that all the statutory requirements have been met.  In those
situations where all the statutory pre-requisites have been established, the
justice of the peace should still consider all of the circumstances in
determining whether to exercise his or her discretion to issue a warrant.  It
is not a step that can be taken lightly.  This is particularly true when a
warrant is sought to search the offices of a news media organization, where the
consequences are likely to be disruptive of the media's role of gathering and publishing
news.

 

                   The media have a
vitally important role to play in a democratic society.  It is the media that,
by gathering and disseminating news, enable members of our society to make an
informed assessment of the issues which may significantly affect their lives
and well-being.  The special significance of the work of the media was
recognized by this Court in Edmonton Journal v. Alberta (Attorney General),
[1989] 2 S.C.R. 1326, at pp. 1339-40.  The importance of that role and the
manner in which it must be fulfilled give rise to special concerns when a
warrant is sought to search media premises.

 

                   The constitutional
protection of freedom of expression afforded by s. 2 (b) of the Charter 
does not, however, import any new or additional requirements for the issuance
of search warrants.  What it does is provide a backdrop against which the
reasonableness of the search may be evaluated.  It requires that careful
consideration be given not only to whether a warrant should issue but also to
the conditions which might properly be imposed upon any search of media
premises.

 

                   Whether the search
of a media office can be considered reasonable will depend on a number of
factors including the nature of the objects to be seized, the manner in which
the search is to be conducted and the degree of urgency of the search.  It is
of particular importance that the justice of the peace consider the effects of
the search and seizure on the ability of the particular media organization in
question to fulfil its function as a news gatherer and news disseminator.  If a
search will impede the media from fulfilling these functions and the
impediments cannot reasonably be controlled through the imposition of
conditions on the execution of the search warrant, then a warrant should only be
issued where a compelling state interest is demonstrated.  This might be
accomplished by satisfying the two factors set out by  Nemetz C.J. in Pacific
Press: namely, that there is no alternative source of information available
or, if there is, that reasonable steps have been taken to obtain the
information from that source.  Alternatively, the search might be justified on
the grounds of the gravity of the offence under investigation and the urgent
need to obtain the evidence expected to be revealed by the search.

 

                   The balancing of
interests is always a difficult and delicate task.  In this case, for example,
the throwing of Molotov cocktails at a building not only damaged the property
but constituted a potential threat to the lives and safety of others.  The
investigation of a serious and violent crime was of importance to the state. 
Further, in light of the ongoing demonstrations, some urgency in conducting the
search must be recognized.   On the other hand, the objects sought to be seized
were the product of the research and investigation of a media organization.  It
was important that the continuing work of the media should not be unduly
impeded.

 

                   The factors to be
weighed with regard to issuing a warrant to search any premises will vary with
the circumstances presented.  This is as true of searches of media offices as
of any other premises.  It seems to me, however, that where the media have
fulfilled their role by gathering the news and publishing it, there would seem
to be less to be said for refusing to make that material available to the
police.  At that point, the media have given to the public, by way of picture
or print, evidence of the commission of a crime.  The media, like any good
citizen, should not be unduly opposed to disclosing to the police the evidence
they have gathered with regard to that crime. 

 

                   For example, if a
private citizen took pictures of a crime being committed and posted those
pictures on a public notice board, the public could quite properly expect that
those pictures and the negatives would, upon request, be delivered to the
police.  This is so as it is in the best interests of all members of the
community to see that crimes are investigated and prosecuted.  Should the
private citizen fail to do so, the police would be expected to take steps to
obtain a warrant to search the citizen's premises for the negatives and copies
of the photographs.  Once the media have published the information, the same
principles might well apply to them.

 

                   The media argue
that the issuance of a search warrant would have the effect of ""drying
up"" their sources of information.  In my view, that argument is seriously
weakened once the media have placed the information in the public domain.  They
can then no longer say, in effect, ""I know that a crime was committed; I
have relevant information that could assist in its investigation and
prosecution, but I'm not going to assist you towards that end"".  Once the
information has been made public, it becomes difficult to contend there would
be a ""chilling effect"" on the media sources if that information were
also disclosed to the police.  At that point, it is unlikely that the police
would want more than the videotape itself.  With the tape in their possession,
the police would usually have no interest in identifying the media's informant
whose tip led to the making of the film.  Should it be necessary,  appropriate
steps might be taken by the media to have the court determine what protection
could properly be obtained.  The police themselves might very well be interested
in protecting the identity of a media informant in many cases.

 

                   Counsel for the CBC
submits that the two factors referred to in Pacific Press should,
pursuant to s. 2 (b) and s. 8  of the Charter , be made mandatory
conditions for the issuance of any warrant for the search of premises of media
organizations.  In essence, the CBC submits that these two factors ought to be
separated from all others that have to be considered in determining the
reasonableness of a search.  It is said that they should be made constitutional
prerequisites of any search of media offices, where the media are not
implicated in the crime under investigation.

 

                   In my view, the
assessment of the reasonableness of a search cannot be said to rest only upon
these two factors.  Rather all factors should be evaluated in light of the
particular factual situation presented.  The factors which may be vital in
assessing the reasonableness of one search may be irrelevant in another. 
Simply stated, it is impossible to isolate two factors from the numerous
considerations which bear on assessment of the reasonableness of a search and
label them as conditional prerequisites.  The essential question can be put in
this way:  taking into account all the circumstances and viewing them fairly
and objectively can it be said that the search was a reasonable one?

 

                   It is the overall
reasonableness of a search  which is protected by   s. 8  of the Charter . 
Certainly the potentially damaging effect of a search and seizure upon the
freedom and the functioning of the press is highly relevant to the assessment
of the reasonableness of the search.  Yet neither s. 2 (b) nor s. 8  of
the Charter  requires that the two factors set out in Pacific Press
must always be met in order for a search to be permissible and constitutionally
valid.  It is essential that flexibility in the balancing process be preserved
so that all the factors relevant to the individual case may be taken into
consideration and properly weighed.

 

                   I am supported in
this conclusion by the reasoning of the Supreme Court of the United States. 
Once again, I recognize that the utmost care must be taken in considering
American authorities.  There are significant differences in the wording of the
constitutional provisions pertaining to freedom of expression.  There are
differences in the history and traditions of the two countries.  I recognize
that American authorities can never be applied automatically as solutions to
Canadian problems.  Nevertheless, it is always helpful to review the careful
consideration and learning which has been applied to this very problem.

 

                                                       AMENDMENT
I

 

                   Congress
shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the
free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or
the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government
for a redress of grievances.

 

                   In Zurcher v.
Stanford Daily, 436 U.S. 547 (1978), the police searched the offices of the
Stanford Daily and seized several photographs which the newspaper had
published showing certain individuals assaulting police officers.  In this
case, it was clear that there was an alternative source of information
available to the police.  Despite this, the search warrant was issued.  On
appeal, the newspaper argued that the search threatened the constitutionally
protected freedom of the press.  White J. delivering the opinion of the
majority of summarized the newspaper's position this way at p. 563:

 

The
general submission is that searches of newspaper offices for evidence of crime
reasonably believed to be on the premises will seriously threaten the ability
of the press to gather, analyze, and disseminate news.

 

In essence, the newspaper argued that
a search warrant could never issue against a press organization where a
subpoena could be used to obtain the information sought by the police.  In
support of its position, the newspaper employed arguments very similar to those
advanced by CBC in the present case.

 

                   White J. for the
majority rejected the newspaper's argument.  In his view, the interests sought
to be protected by the newspaper could adequately be protected by the
requirement of reasonableness.  At page 565, he wrote:

 

They
[the framers of the American Constitution] nevertheless did not forbid warrants
where the press was involved, did not require special showings that subpoenas
would be impractical, and did not insist that the owner of the place to be
searched, if connected with the press, must be shown to be implicated in the
offense being investigated.  Further, the prior cases do no more than insist
that the courts apply the warrant requirements with particular exactitude when
First Amendment interests would be endangered by the search.  As we see it, no
more than this is required where the warrant requested is for the seizure of
criminal evidence reasonably believed to be on the premises occupied by a
newspaper.  Properly administered, the preconditions for a warrant -- probable
cause, specificity with respect to the place to be searched and the things to
be seized, and overall reasonableness -- should afford sufficient protection
against the harms that are assertedly threatened by warrants for searching
newspaper offices.

 

 

                   Thus it is clear
that, in the United States, despite the constitutional protection provided to
the press, a warrant may be issued for the search of media premises even though
alternative sources of information are available to the police.

 

Summary of Factors to be Considered on
the Issuance of a Search Warrant and Review of a Search Warrant

 

                   It may be helpful
to summarize the factors to be considered by a justice of the peace on an
application to obtain a warrant to search the premises of a news media
organization together with those factors which may be pertinent to a court
reviewing the issuance of a search warrant.

 

1)
It is essential that all the requirements set out in s. 487(1) (b) of the
Criminal Code  for the issuance of a search warrant be met.

 

2)
Once the statutory conditions have been met, the justice of the peace should
consider all of the circumstances in determining whether to exercise his or her
discretion to issue a warrant.

 

3)
The justice of the peace should ensure that a balance is struck between the
competing interests of the state in the investigation and prosecution of crimes
and the right to privacy of the media in the course of their news gathering and
news dissemination.  It must be borne in mind that the media play a vital role in
the functioning of a democratic society.  Generally speaking, the news media
will not be implicated in the crime under investigation.  They are truly an
innocent third party.  This is a particularly important factor to be considered
in attempting to strike an appropriate balance, including the consideration of
imposing conditions on that warrant.

 

4)
The affidavit in support of the application must contain sufficient detail to
enable the justice of the peace to properly exercise his or her discretion as
to the issuance of a search warrant.

 

5)
Although it is not a constitutional requirement, the affidavit material should
ordinarily disclose whether there are alternative sources from which the
information may reasonably be obtained and, if there is an alternative source,
that it has been investigated and all reasonable efforts to obtain the
information have been exhausted.

 

6)
If the information sought has been disseminated by the media in whole or in
part, this will be a factor which will favour the issuing of the search
warrant.

 

7)
If a justice of the peace determines that a warrant should be issued for the
search of media premises, consideration should then be given to the imposition
of some conditions on its implementation,  so that the media organization will
not be unduly impeded in the publishing or dissemination of the news.

 

8)
If, subsequent to the issuing of a search warrant, it comes to light the
authorities failed to disclose pertinent information that could well have
affected the decision to issue the warrant, this may result in a finding that
the warrant was invalid.

 

9)
Similarly, if the search itself is unreasonably conducted, this may render the
search invalid.

 

Application of These Principles to
This Case

 

                   The Criminal
Code  by means of s. 487  does no more than require that a justice of the
peace, before issuing a search warrant, be satisfied that there are reasonable
grounds to believe that something which will afford evidence with respect to
the commission of a crime will be found in the described building, receptacle
or place.  In the present case, officer Ouellette's information was sufficient
to meet these requirements.  There is no evidence in this case that the search
impeded the media in their function of gathering and disseminating the news. 
In these circumstances, the search was a reasonable one under s. 8  of the Charter ,
notwithstanding any deficiencies in the information with respect to alternative
sources.  But, in the alternative, officer Ouellette declared in his
information that all reasonable sources of the information sought had been
pursued but none were available.  In this regard it is of considerable
significance that there was a specific finding that there was no bad faith
involved on the part of the police.

 

 

                   In light of this
finding, it is safe to accept the information as one sworn in good faith.  It
follows that there is nothing nefarious in the failure to mention the presence
at the scene of the identification officers.  That same finding makes it
appropriate to assume that these officers could not be considered an
alternative source of information.  If they could, the police would surely
prefer to use their own witnesses and photographs or videotapes in the
preparation of their cases.  In any event, the finding that there was no bad
faith is of critical importance to my conclusions.

 

                   Ouellette's
information, therefore, directly addressed the concerns expressed by Nemetz
C.J. in Pacific Press in declaring that no alternative sources of
information were available.  It must be assumed that the identification
officers who were present at the scene could not be of assistance.

 

                   It would have been
preferable if the presence of police identification officers at the scene had
been set out in the information, together with the explanation as to why the
officers were unable to supply the information sought by the police.  However,
as I have said, it must be assumed that the information was drawn and presented
in good faith.  This can be the only conclusion to be drawn, in light of the
finding of Daigle J. that there was no bad faith involved on the part of the
police.  The statement that ""there [were] no other means available to the
police for obtaining evidence"" must be accepted at face value.  That
statement should be taken as a short form of saying that the evidence sought
was not available from the identification officers.  While the police were
required to provide an accurate description of the relevant facts, they were
not obliged to describe every minute step taken in the course of the
investigation.  In sum, the information provided the justice of the peace with
sufficient evidence to issue a search warrant.  There is nothing in the record
to indicate that the justice of the peace improperly exercised her discretion. 
In the circumstances, it should be accepted that the warrant was validly
issued.

 

Disposition

 

                   In the result, the
appeal should be dismissed.

 

//McLachlin J.//

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   McLachlin
J. (dissenting) -- In the companion case, Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v.
Lessard, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 000, I set out my view of the legal principles
applicable to this type of case.  Those principles lead me to the conclusion
that the warrant in this case violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  and cannot be upheld.

 

                   The affidavit in
the case at bar indicated that there were no alternative sources of information
which could be used in a court of law, since the other sources of information
available to the police ""do not dare come forward and testify in [a] court
of law.""  No reasons for the reluctance of these witnesses was given.
There is no suggestion that the witnesses in question could not have been
subpoenaed to testify.  It may be that they feared censure by fellow
trade-union members if they testified against them. But we do not know.  In the
absence of such information, the justice of the peace was not in a position to
determine if the issuance of the warrant was really necessary,  or whether it
was justified, given the violation of Charter  rights which it entailed.

 

                   I would allow the
appeal.

                   A CBC camera crew
videotaped a group of people occupying and damaging a post office building and
both CBC's English and French language networks aired portions of the
videotape.  There is no indication that the police were at the scene or were
aware of the incident at the time the tape was made.  The police sought an
authorization from a justice of the peace to search for the videotapes the day
after the broadcast.  The parties agreed that nothing in the affidavit would
permit the justice of the peace to determine if there were an alternative
source of information and, if there were such a source, whether reasonable
steps had been taken to get the information from that source.  Nonetheless, a
warrant was granted to enter, search and seize the videotapes at the CBC's head
office in Montreal on the basis of the information.

 

                   Several tapes were
seized and, at the request of CBC officials, were placed in a sealed envelope
while the validity of the warrant was contested.  To that end, the CBC brought
an application for certiorari to quash the search warrant.  The Quebec
Superior Court dismissed the application but a majority of the Court of Appeal
allowed CBC's appeal.

 

                   Held (McLachlin J. dissenting):  The
appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory and Stevenson
JJ.:  Warrants for the search of any premises constitute a significant
intrusion on the privacy of individuals and corporations alike.  The privacy
interests of individuals in a democratic society must be carefully weighed in a
search warrant application against the interests of the state in investigating
and prosecuting crimes.  This weighing and balancing will vary with the facts
on each application.  Even after the requirements of s. 487  of the Criminal
Code  have been met, the process of determining if a search warrant should
issue may still be a difficult and complex process.  Among commercial premises,
the media are entitled to particularly careful consideration, both as to the
issuance of a search warrant and as to the conditions that may be attached to a
warrant to ensure that any disruption of the gathering and dissemination of
news is limited as much as possible.  The media are entitled to this special
consideration because of the importance of their role in a democratic society.

 

                   The following
factors should be considered in issuing a search warrant for media premises. 
(1) The requirements of s. 487(1) (b) of the Criminal Code 
must be met.  (2) The justice of the peace should then consider all of the
circumstances in determining whether to exercise his or her discretion to issue
a warrant and (3) ensure that a delicate balance is struck between the
competing interests of the state in the investigation and prosecution of crimes
and the right to privacy of the media in the course of their news gathering and
news dissemination.  The press is truly an innocent third party; this factor is
most important in attempting to strike an appropriate balance, including the
consideration of imposing conditions on that warrant.  (4) The affidavit in
support of the application must contain sufficient detail to enable a proper
exercise of discretion as to whether or not to issue a search warrant.  (5)
Although not constitutionally required, the affidavit material should
ordinarily disclose whether there are alternative sources, and if reasonable
and alternative sources exist, whether those sources have been investigated and
all reasonable efforts to obtain the information have been exhausted.  (6)
Dissemination of the information by the media in whole or in part will be a
factor favouring the issuance of the search warrant.  (7) If a justice of the
peace determines that a warrant should be issued for the search of media
premises, consideration should then be given to the imposition of some
conditions on its implementation.  (8) The search warrant may be found to be
invalid if, after its issuance, it is found that pertinent information was not
disclosed, or (9) if the search is unreasonably conducted.

 

                   The crucial factor here
was that the media had broadcast portions of the videotape depicting the
commission of a crime before the application for the warrant.  The failure to
set out that there was either no alternative source of information to the
police or, if there were, that the information sought could not be obtained
from that alternative source, is a basis upon which the justice of the peace
could refuse to issue the search warrant.  This information should in most
cases be placed before the justice of the peace.  It is not, however, a
constitutionally required condition for the issuance of a search warrant.  

 

                   The search here was
conducted reasonably and did not affect the operations of the news media. 
There was no indication that the police were at the scene or even aware of the
crime when the film was made.  It is reasonable to infer that they learned the
details of the crime from the broadcast.

 

                   All members of the
community have an interest in seeing that crimes are investigated and
prosecuted and the media might accordingly even consider voluntarily delivering
their videotapes to the police.  Once the news media have published the
gathered information, that information then passes into the public domain.  The
publication of that information is a very important factor for the justice of
the peace to consider.  The publication or broadcasting of the information was
a sufficiently important factor to enable the justice of the peace to issue the
search warrant notwithstanding the failure of the police to explain that there
was no alternative source available that would give them the information
contained in the videotape.

 

                   The failure to set
out the lack of alternative sources was simply another factor to be taken into
account in assessing the reasonableness of the search.  Here, the actual search
was conducted reasonably and properly.  There was no interference with the
operation of the news media, nor was the freedom of the press threatened.  The
media had already completed their basic function of news gathering and news
dissemination and the seizure of the tapes at this stage therefore could not be
said to have a chilling effect on the media's sources of news.

 

                   Per La Forest J.:  As long as they are
strictly confined to situations similar to the present case, Cory J.'s reasons
were generally agreed with.

 

                   Freedom of the
press is vital to a free society  and comprises the right to disseminate news,
information and beliefs.  The gathering of information could in many
circumstances be seriously inhibited, if government had too ready access to
information in the hands of the media.  The press should not be turned into an
investigative arm of the police.  Thus, the fear that the police can easily
gain access to a reporter's notes could well hamper the ability of the press to
gather information.  Barring exigent circumstances, the seizure of a reporter's
handwritten notes and  ""contact book"" and items of this nature should
only be permitted when it is clear that all reasonable alternative sources have
been exhausted.

 

                   A line should be
drawn, however, between films and photographs of an event and items such as a
reporter's personal notes, recordings of interviews and source ""contact
lists"".  The ""`chilling effect' on newsgathering"" argument was
unpersuasive in so far as it pertained to films and photographs taken of an
event because the chill is already there.  Absent a promise of confidentiality,
no one can reasonably believe that there is no danger of identification when he
or she is being captured on film by the press.  With respect to films and
photographs, the exhaustion of alternative sources should not necessarily be
required, unless there has been a guarantee of confidentiality.

 

                   The possibility
that the police will uncover other confidential sources in the course of
searching for the relevant material is too attenuated to add restrictions
against searches of press organizations under all circumstances.  This concern
can probably best be addressed by limiting the warrant to specifically
delineated items.

 

                   The search here was
reasonable under s. 8  of the Charter .  There was no violation of s. 2 (b)
in the specific circumstances of this case, and it was not necessary to
speculate about possible infringements resulting from a search in other
circumstances.  Even given an infringement, the search would be reasonable
under s. 1  when the compelling requirements of law enforcement are weighed
against the highly tenuous interference with the right.  The question whether a
search constitutes a reasonable limit under s. 1  is probably not different from
the question whether a search is reasonable under s. 8 .

 

                   Per L'Heureux-Dubé J.:  The sole issue in
this case concerns the right of the police to obtain a warrant to search the
premises of an innocent third party (the CBC) in order to obtain evidence of
the commission of a crime.  The freedom of the press was not at issue, the more
so here since the material sought had already been broadcast on two occasions
before the search warrant was issued.  These reasons addressed only the
specific facts of this case; other sets of circumstances could warrant
different considerations.  No notion of confidentiality was attached or implied
to the object of the search warrant in this case. 

 

                   Once the conditions
set out in s. 487  are met, the justice of the peace has jurisdiction to issue a
search warrant to retrieve evidence of the commission of a crime even absent a
statement as to the availability of alternative sources.  Neither the law nor
jurisprudence mandate such a statement even when the premises searched are
those of an innocent third party, here a member of the media.  A balancing
process is neither mandated by s. 487  nor is it practical with regard both to
the functions of the justice of the peace and to the burden on those requesting
the search warrant.  

 

                   Notwithstanding its
importance, the constitutional protection of the freedom of the press does not
go as far as guaranteeing the press special privileges which ordinary citizens,
also innocent third parties, would not enjoy in a search for evidence of a
crime.  The law does not make such a distinction and the Charter  does
not warrant it. In fact, the press generally does not request special
privileges.

 

                   Conditions can be
imposed by a justice of the peace as to the manner in which a warrant can be
executed and, in that regard, particular considerations for the media are quite
relevant.  These conditions, however, have nothing to do with the jurisdiction
of the justice of the peace to issue the warrant once the conditions of s. 487 
are established, notwithstanding the fact that the premises to be searched
belong to innocent third persons or members of the press.  There is no
justification to add distinctions or nuances to the text of the Criminal
Code  based on the nature of the premises to be searched.

 

                   Per McLachlin J. (dissenting):  Freedom
of the press under the Charter  must be interpreted in a generous and
liberal fashion having regard to the history of the guarantee and focusing on
the purpose of the guarantee.  

                   The Charter 
guarantee is to protect the values underlying freedom of the press, like
freedom of expression, and includes the pursuit of truth.  Freedom of the
press, like freedom of expression, is important to the pursuit of truth, to
participation in the community and to individual self-fulfillment.  In
achieving these means, an effective and free press is dependent on its ability
to gather, analyze and disseminate information, independent from any state
imposed restrictions on content, form or perspective except those justified
under s. 1  of the Charter . 

 

                   The ways in which
police search and seizure may impinge on the values underlying freedom of the
press are manifest and can adversely affect the role of the media in furthering
the search for truth, community participation and self-fulfillment.  It is not
every state restriction on the press, however, which infringes s. 2 (b). 
Press activities which are not related to the values fundamental to freedom of
the press may not merit Charter  protection.  The press activity at issue
here - gathering and disseminating information about a labour demonstration -
was directly related to the furtherance of the values underlying the guarantee
of free expression.  Such search and seizure accordingly infringes freedom of
the press as guaranteed by s. 2 (b) of the Charter .

 

                   A search and/or
seizure on press premises which infringes s. 2 (b) can be justified
under s. 1  where:

 

(l)
The search/seizure is necessary because there are no alternative sources for
the information required;

 

(2)
The importance of the search/seizure outweighs the damage to be caused by the
infringement of freedom of the press; and 

 

(3)
The warrant ensures that the search/seizure interferes with the press's freedom
as little as possible.

 

                   Given the
seriousness of any violation of freedom of the press, the justice of the peace
must be satisfied that the special requirements for the issuance of a warrant
of search and seizure against a press agency are clearly established and made
out with some particularity.

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

//La Forest J.//

 

                   La
Forest J. -- I have had
the advantage of reading the reasons of my colleagues, Justices L'Heureux-Dubé,
Cory and McLachlin.  The facts, judicial history and much of the antecedent
jurisprudence are set forth in the reasons of Cory J., and I shall not repeat
them.  I would dispose of the case in the manner proposed by Cory J.  I agree
with much of what he has to say, but I would confine the reasons strictly to
situations similar to the present case.  I am particularly concerned with the
extent to which reliance should be placed on the facts that the respondent (the
CBC) had already placed the information sought to be obtained under the search
warrant in the public domain, and that the search did not interfere with its
broadcasting capabilities.  I agree that these facts may properly be taken into
account and that, in the circumstances of this case, they have great weight
having regard to the nature of the information sought and the circumstances in
which it was obtained, but reliance on such factors in other situations could,
I fear, lead to serious infringements of the freedom of the press and other
media of communications.  I, therefore, think it right to set forth my own
perspectives on the issues.

 

                   Like Cory J., I
take it as a given that freedom of the press and other media is vital to a free
society.  There can be no doubt, of course, that it comprises the right to
disseminate news, information and beliefs.  This was the manner in which the
right was originally expressed, in the first draft of s. 2 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  before its expansion to its present form. 
However, the freedom to disseminate information would be of little value if the
freedom under s. 2 (b) did not also encompass the right to gather news
and other information without undue governmental interference.

 

                   I have little
doubt, too, that the gathering of information could in many circumstances be
seriously inhibited if government had too ready access to information in the
hands of the media.  That someone might be deterred from providing information
to a journalist because his or her identity could be revealed seems to me to be
self-evident.  As Stewart J. (dissenting) stated in Zurcher v. Stanford
Daily, 436 U.S. 547 (1978), at p. 572:

 

It
requires no blind leap of faith to understand that a person who gives
information to a journalist only on condition that his identity will not be
revealed will be less likely to give that information if he knows that, despite
the journalist's assurance, his identity may in fact be disclosed.

 

                   Concerns over the
potential impact that unrestricted searches could have on freedom of the press
have apparently led to the adoption in the United States of protective
legislation by over half of the state legislatures as well as by the federal
government.  The Privacy Protection Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. 2000aa
(1988), for example, prohibits the seizure of media ""work product
materials"" except where ""there is probable cause to believe that the
person possessing such materials has committed or is committing the criminal
offense to which the materials relate"" or ""there is reason to believe
that the immediate seizure of such materials is necessary to prevent the death
of, or serious bodily injury to, a human being"".  A similar type of
legislation, that would require that search warrants be issued only when no
other reasonable alternative exists, was proposed by the Ducharme Committee, a
Quebec government Task Force instituted to study the issue of journalism and
the law in the province of Quebec.

 

                   In my view, the
threat to the freedom of the press that would result from unrestrained searches
of certain journalistic material goes beyond the merely speculative.  I would
draw a line, however, between films and photographs of an event and items such
as a reporter's personal notes, recordings of interviews and source
""contact lists"".  In both this case and the companion New Brunswick
case, Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. New Brunswick (Attorney General),
[1991] 3 S.C.R. 000, the only materials seized were videotapes and photographs
of the demonstration.

 

                   I find the CBC's
argument that there will be a ""chilling effect"" on newsgathering
unpersuasive, in so far as that argument pertains to films and photographs
taken of an event.  I think the chill is already there.  Absent a promise of
confidentiality, no one can reasonably believe that there is no danger of
identification when he is being captured on film by the press.  When the press
is covering an event under circumstances such as those in the present case, the
very reason for the presence of cameramen is to take film and photographs for
the purpose of broadcasting.  While not all of the photographs will get
published, there is a very real possibility that someone who commits a crime in
front of the camera will find himself on the evening news or on the front page
of a newspaper.  The situation might be different if the press had made an
undertaking to edit the film so that no identities would be revealed, or had
promised confidentiality.  Absent such a promise, however, it should be
apparent that a photograph of a demonstrator ""caught in the act"" of
vandalizing a post office or factory is precisely the sort of
""newsworthy"" item that is likely to make it into the paper.

 

                   As earlier
mentioned, however, I do think that the ""chilling effect"" argument
has merit in relation to other aspects of a reporter's work product.  A
distinguishing feature of the Pacific Press case (Re Pacific Press
Ltd. and The Queen (1977), 37 C.C.C. (2d) 487 (B.C.S.C.)), discussed by
Cory J., is that in that case reporters' handwritten notes and a reporter's
""contact book"" were also seized in the search.  The press should not
be turned into an investigative arm of the police.  The fear that the police can
easily gain access to a reporter's notes could well hamper the ability of the
press to gather information.  I would think that, barring exigent
circumstances, the seizure of items of this nature should only be permitted
when it is clear that all reasonable alternative sources have been exhausted.

 

                   With respect to
films and photographs, the exhaustion of alternative sources should not, in my
view, necessarily be required, unless there has been a guarantee of
confidentiality.  It can be argued that this distinction is not workable, since
the police, and hence the justice of the peace, will in most cases not know in
advance whether any information contained on a videotape is confidential or
not.  On the other hand, if the media organization claims that there is such
confidential material, it would be a simple enough matter to seal the seized
film in an envelope, as was done in this case, and subject it to an in
camera hearing by the reviewing judge.

 

                   Another matter
requiring consideration is the possibility that the police will uncover other
confidential sources in the course of searching for the relevant material. 
This arguably would point towards adding restrictions against searches of press
organizations under all circumstances.  While the CBC argues that the
possibility of this occurring will also render people less likely to provide
the press with information, I am, on the whole, of the opinion that this
connection is simply too attenuated; see Moysa v. Alberta (Labour Relations
Board), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1572, at p. 1581, where compulsion of testimony
from a journalist was held not to violate s. 2 (b) in the absence of
evidence that such compulsion would detrimentally affect the journalist's
ability to gather information.  Should there be evidence in a future case that
this does indeed give rise to a real problem, the issue can be addressed at
that time.  In the meantime, this concern can probably best be addressed by
limiting the warrant to specifically delineated items.

 

                   The foregoing
remarks have been made on the basis that the search here was reasonable under
s. 8  of the Charter , but I note that my colleague McLachlin J.
approaches the matter from the perspective that there has been a violation of
s. 2 (b), which would require justification under s. 1  of the Charter . 
I am clearly of the view for the considerations mentioned in discussing the
reasonableness of the search that there was no violation of s. 2 (b) in
the specific circumstances of this case, and I need not speculate about
possible infringements resulting from a search in other circumstances, some of
which I have postulated earlier.  Even had I been disposed to hold there was an
infringement, the compelling requirements of law enforcement, when weighed
against the highly tenuous interference with the right, would lead me to the
view that the search in this case would be justifiable under s. 1 .  I am not,
in any event, certain that the question whether a search constitutes a
reasonable limit under s. 1  is really different from the question whether a
search is reasonable under s. 8 .

 

                   Finally I should
draw attention to two other matters.  The first is that this appeal is solely
concerned with search warrants issued upon the media as a third party, i.e., a
party that is not a suspect in the investigation.  This may give rise to
different considerations and I have not considered it.  Nor have I considered
the standards that should apply to searches against third parties generally,
irrespective of whether they are members of the media or not.  It will be evident,
however, that I do not think the rights of such a party would be infringed in a
case like the present.

 

                   For these reasons,
I would allow the appeal.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

//L'Heureux-Dubé J.//

 

                   L'Heureux-Dubé
J. -- I have had the
benefit of my colleague Justice Cory's reasons.  I agree with the result he
reaches, for essentially the same reasons as Monet J.A. who dissented in the
Quebec Court of Appeal.

 

                   The sole issue in
this case concerns the right of the police to obtain a warrant to search the
premises of an innocent third party, here the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
(the CBC), in order to obtain evidence of the commission of a crime.

 

                   The CBC challenges
the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace to issue such a warrant.  By way
of certiorari it seeks to quash the warrant on the basis that the
affidavit in support of the application for its issuance did not disclose
efforts made to canvass alternative sources of evidence.

 

                   Section 487  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (formerly s. 443 ) sets out the conditions upon
which a justice of the peace has jurisdiction to issue a search warrant:

 

                   487. (1)  A justice who is satisfied by
information on oath in Form 1 that there are reasonable grounds to believe that
there is in a building, receptacle or place

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(b) 
anything that there is reasonable ground to believe will afford evidence with
respect to the commission of an offence against this Act or any other Act of
Parliament,

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

may
at any time issue a warrant under his hand authorizing a person named therein
or a peace officer

 

(d) 
to search the building, receptacle or place for any such thing and to seize it,
and

 

(e) 
subject to any other Act of Parliament, to, as soon as practicable, bring the
thing seized before, or make a report in respect thereof to, the justice or
some other justice for the same territorial division in accordance with section
489.1.

 

                   As my colleague
Cory J. points out, the constitutionality of the section is not at issue here
and it is not disputed that the justice of the peace has discretion to
determine whether to issue the warrant.  The debate centres rather on the
extent of that discretion as it bears on his or her jurisdiction.

 

                   I wish to make
clear at the outset that my reasons address only the specific facts of this
case since other sets of circumstances may warrant different considerations. 
Here, the material which was the object of the search warrant consisted of
films and photographs of a particular event to which no notion of
confidentiality was attached or implied.  The situation differed fundamentally
from that in Re Pacific Press Ltd. and The Queen (1977), 37 C.C.C. (2d)
487 (B.C.S.C).

 

                   According to Durand
J. of the Quebec Superior Court, once the conditions set out in s. 487  are met,
the justice of the peace is justified in issuing the search warrant.  Monet
J.A., in dissent, agreed with this position.  However, the majority of the
Court of Appeal held that, before issuing a warrant for the search of the
premises of innocent third persons (members of the press because of the
constitutional protection afforded by s. 2 (b) of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms , according to Jacques J.A.), the justice of the
peace must be satisfied that no alternative sources of the information sought
are available.  I disagree.  I also disagree with Cory J.'s enumeration of the
factors that must be taken into account by the justice of the peace in
determining whether a search warrant should be issued.  In my view, such a
balancing process at that stage is neither mandated by s. 487 of the Code
nor is it practical with regard both to the functions of the justice of the
peace and the burden on those requesting the search warrant, often as a matter
of urgency.

 

                   The search for
alternative sources may involve a lengthy and costly process apart from the
difficult determination of what constitutes an ""alternative source""
and the possibility of losing the benefit of the evidence requested should the
alternative sources be, for one reason or another, lost, declared inadmissible,
etc.  One can readily see the complexity of the task with which a justice of
the peace may be burdened should he or she be held to such a standard each time
the issuance of a search warrant is requested against an innocent third party. 
The respondent, however, has restricted its argument to the press, based on s.
2 (b) of the Charter .

 

                   While I agree with
my colleague Cory J. (at p. 000) that ""the media play a vital role in the
functioning of a democratic society"", as Vallerand J.A. pointed out
((1989), 50 C.C.C. (3d) 428, at p. 441), [translation]
""the freedom of the press is not in issue here"" and the more so here
since the material sought had already been broadcast on two occasions before
the search warrant was issued.  Moreover, presented with the warrant, the CBC
simply provided the police with the material in question, the whole without any
disturbance.  The CBC rather argues on behalf of the principle involved.

 

                   Important as the
constitutional protection of the freedom of the press is, it does not go as far
as guaranteeing the press special privileges which ordinary citizens, also
innocent third parties, would not enjoy in a search for evidence of a crime. 
The law does not make such a distinction and the Charter  does not
warrant it. In fact, the press itself does not generally request special
privileges.

 

                   The respondent
invokes the fear of a ""chilling effect"".  In Zurcher v. Stanford
Daily, 436 U.S. 547 (1978), a case involving a similar question,  the
United States Supreme Court had the following response when seized with this
argument:

 

The
general submission is that searches of newspaper offices for evidence of crime
reasonably believed to be on the premises will seriously threaten the ability
of the press to gather, analyze, and disseminate news. [p. 563]

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

Properly
administered, the preconditions for a warrant -- probable cause, specificity
with respect to the place to be searched and the things to be seized, and
overall reasonableness -- should afford sufficient protection against the harms
that are assertedly threatened by warrants for searching newspaper offices. [p. 565]

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

Nor
are we convinced, any more than we were in Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S.
665 (1972), that confidential sources will disappear and that the press will
suppress news because of fears of warranted searches. [p. 566]

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   The
fact is that respondents and amici have pointed to only a very few
instances in the entire United States since 1971 involving the issuance of
warrants for searching newspaper premises.  This reality hardly suggests
abuse;  and if abuse occurs, there will be time enough to deal with it.  Furthermore,
the press is not only an important, critical, and valuable asset to society,
but it is not easily intimidated -- nor should it be. [p. 566]

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

And
surely a warrant to search newspaper premises for criminal evidence such as the
one issued here for news photographs taken in a public place carries no
realistic threat of prior restraint or of any direct restraint whatsoever on
the publication of the Daily or on its communication of ideas.  The hazards of
such warrants can be avoided by a neutral magistrate carrying out his responsibilities
under the Fourth Amendment, for he has ample tools at his disposal to confine
warrants to search within reasonable limits.  [p. 567] [Emphasis added.]

 

                   For the same
reasons, I would dismiss the argument of the respondent.

 

                   As regards the two
decisions relied upon by the respondent, I will make the following comments.

 

                   In Descôteaux v.
Mierzwinski, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 860, this Court was concerned with the extent
of the power of the justice of the peace to authorize a search and seizure of
documents protected by the solicitor-client privilege.  Lamer J. (now Chief
Justice) writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, recognized that the
jurisdiction of the justice of the peace centered not on the nature of the
premises searched but on the reasonable belief that objects covered by
para. (b) of s. 443(1) (now s. 487(1) ) of the Code were to be
found on the premises (at p. 883).  He pointed out, however, that the nature
of the premises to be searched is relevant to ascertain the manner in
which the search is to be conducted (at p. 889):

 

One
does not enter a church in the same way as a lion's den, or a warehouse in the
same way as a lawyer's office.  One does not search the premises of a third
party who is not alleged to have participated in the commission of a crime in
the same way as those of someone who is the subject of such an allegation.

 

                   The comments on the
search of premises of the media are purely obiter.  I entirely agree,
however, with the remarks of Lamer J. that conditions can be imposed by a
justice of the peace as to the manner in which a warrant can be executed and,
in that regard, particular considerations for the media are quite relevant,
such as the hours during which the normal media operations would be less
disturbed, the areas of the search and so on.  But such conditions in the
execution of the warrant  have nothing to do with the jurisdiction of the
justice of the peace to issue the warrant once the conditions of s. 487 of the
Code are established, notwithstanding that the premises to be searched
belong to innocent third persons or members of the press.

 

                   As for Re
Pacific Press, supra, the very special circumstances of that case do
not warrant that this case be regarded as a precedent binding on the courts
when dealing with the press.  There is no justification, in my view, to add
distinctions or nuances to the text of the Code based on the nature of
the premises to be searched.  As Monet J.A. pointed out, at p. 435, this could
easily have been done in s. 487  as was the case in s. 185(1)(h):  [translation] ""When Parliament
intends to create a rule of subsidiarity, it does so in clear terms.""

 

                   He also states (at
pp. 431-32):

 

[translation]  Parliament did not
create exceptions.  Bankers . . . lawyers . . .
(subject to nuances, for example s. 444.1  of the Criminal Code ),
political parties . . . public service
businesses . . . hospitals . . . in principle, are treated in
the same manner as all others.

 

                   Common
sense, none the less,
requires that the judge of s. 443 not derogate from it but temper or modify it
depending on the circumstances.  One author, James A. Fontana, expressed this
in the following manner . . .

 

                   Where
the owner or occupier of the premises is an innocent third party, however, or
where the person is in lawful possession of the goods to be searched for, the
standards applicable to the search warrant process are, accordingly, much
higher, requiring greater accuracy of documentation and fairness of
enforcement. [Emphasis in original.]

 

                   I share that view.

 

                   Finally, Monet
J.A., after observing that ""[h]ard facts make bad law"", cites the
opinion of the Law Reform Commission of Canada (Working Paper 30, Police
Powers: Search and Seizure in Criminal Law Enforcement, 1983) which
criticizes the rule set by Pacific Press and does not recommend its
general application for reasons which I fully endorse.

 

                   In summary,
considering the text of s. 487 of the Code, the constitutionality of
which is not attacked, once the conditions set out in that section are met, the
justice of the peace has jurisdiction to issue a search warrant to retrieve
evidence of the commission of a crime even in the absence of a statement as to
the availability of alternative sources, which neither the law nor
jurisprudence mandate even when the premises searched are those of an innocent
third party, in this instance, a member of the media.  Besides, the freedom of
the press is not involved here.

 

                   Consequently, I
would allow the appeal and dispose of this appeal as my colleague Cory J.
suggests. 

 

                   The judgment of
Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory and Stevenson JJ. was delivered by

 

//Cory J.//

 

                   Cory
J. -- This appeal was
heard on the same day as Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. New Brunswick
(Attorney General), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 000, and raises similar issues.  Here
too, consideration must be given to the validity of a warrant issued for the
search of premises occupied by a media organization.  In this case, the
material sought had already been broadcast on two occasions by the respondent
when the search warrant was sought.  However, the affidavit in support of the
application for the warrant did not refer to any efforts made by the police to
obtain the evidence from alternative sources.

 

The Factual Background

 

                   On June 17, 1987, a
camera crew from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (the ""CBC"")
filmed a group of people occupying and damaging a post office building in
Pointe-Claire, Quebec.  Portions of the videotape were broadcast twice on both
the English and French networks of the CBC.  There is no indication that the
police were at the scene or were aware of the incident at the time the film was
made.

 

                   The day following
the broadcast of the footage, Ludger Cyr, an officer of the Montreal Urban
Community police force, sought an authorization from a justice of the peace to
search for the videotapes on which the acts of vandalism were recorded.  The
specific information sought and the basis for requesting it were described in
this way:

[translation] 1 - Videotape on which
persons were filmed while causing damage to the interior of the Post Office at
15 Donegani Street in Pointe-Claire.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

Police
investigation.

 

In
addition, part of this tape was shown on the 6:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. news on
17/6/87 on CBC TV Channels 2 and 6.

 

                   The parties are in
agreement that there was nothing in the information which would permit the
justice of the peace to determine if there were an alternative source of
information and, if there were such a source, whether reasonable steps had been
taken to get the information from that source.  Nonetheless, on the basis of
Cyr's information, a warrant was granted to enter, search and seize the
videotapes at the CBC's head office in Montreal.

 

                   Later that day, Cyr
and another officer seized five videotapes.  Four of these tapes contained raw
footage of the incidents filmed while the fifth tape was that of a news report
in the form in which it had been broadcast.  At the request of CBC officials,
the tapes were placed in a sealed envelope while the validity of the warrant
was contested.  To that end, CBC brought an application for certiorari
to quash the search warrant.

 

Judgments Below

 

Quebec Superior Court, [1987] R.J.Q. 2543

 

                   Durand J. dismissed
the CBC's application to quash the warrant.  He found the information provided
to the justice of the peace sufficient to support the issuance of the warrant. 
He wrote (at p. 2545):

 

                   [translation] This text, added to the
one mentioned above, explains the offence in question, the manner in which it
was committed and the item to be seized, as well as its probative value. 
Nothing more is required for an ordinary seizure.

 

                   CBC contended that,
where the police seek a warrant to seize items from a press organization which
is not implicated in the crime under investigation, the police must demonstrate
that either no alternative source of the information exists or that the police
had attempted and failed to elicit the information from those sources.  Durand
J. held that no reasonable alternative source existed.  He stated (at p. 2549):

 

                   [translation] The mis-en-cause did not
witness the incidents of June 17, 1987 in Pointe-Claire.  It must be concluded
that the tape described in the information will enable them to identify the
wrongdoer or wrongdoers and that they learned of it only by having watched the
television news the day before the warrant application.  The crime had just been
committed, they were beginning their investigation and they had reason to
believe that this tape would help them pursue it.

 

                   There
was no reasonable alternative to this seizure and there was no need to mention
this in the information.

 

Quebec Court of Appeal, [1989] R.J.Q. 2043, 50 C.C.C. (3d)
428

 

                   The majority of the
Court of Appeal allowed the appeal brought by CBC.  Relying on the decision of
the British Columbia Supreme Court in Re Pacific Press Ltd. and the Queen
(1977), 37 C.C.C. (2d) 487 and the decision of this Court in Descôteaux v.
Mierzwinski, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 860, Jacques J.A. held that the constitutional
protection of freedom of the press required that searches only be conducted in
the offices of a media organization when no other source of information was
available.  Therefore, because the supporting information did not address the
issue of alternative sources, he held that the warrant ought to be quashed.

 

                   Vallerand J.A. also
concluded that no search could be conducted when alternative sources of the
information sought were available.  He concluded that there is no distinction
between a press organization and any other entity in this regard.  He expressed
the view that search warrants, because of their intrusive nature, should always
be issued with reticence.  As a result, a justice of the peace should only
issue a warrant upon being satisfied that there was either no reasonable
alternative source available or, if there were, that all reasonable steps had been
taken to get the information from the alternative source and they were
unsuccessful.  As the justice of the peace did not have any information upon
which to make those findings, Vallerand J.A. held, he was without jurisdiction
to issue the warrant.  

 

                   Monet J.A., in
dissent, would have dismissed the appeal.  It was his position that since
Parliament had not specifically required proof of the lack of alternative
sources of information for the issuance of a search warrant, it was not
required.  By way of comparison, he referred to s. 185(1) (h) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , dealing with wiretaps.  There, Parliament had
specifically added the requirement that a police officer depose that all
alternative sources had been solicited but that no information had been
forthcoming.  He was therefore of the view that, had Parliament intended to
impose the same requirement on those seeking a search warrant, it would have
done so.

The Requirements for the Issuance of a
Search Warrant

 

                   Like Vallerand
J.A., I am of the view that warrants for the search of any premises constitute
a significant intrusion on the privacy of individuals and corporations alike. 
Family and business confidences which are irrelevant to the crime under
investigation may be reviewed by the unsympathetic eyes of a stranger.  A
search is always intrusive, upsetting and to some degree disruptive of the life
or business of the individual subjected to the search.  It is for this reason
that a justice of the peace considering a search warrant application must
undertake a careful weighing of the privacy interests of individuals in a
democratic society against the interests of the state in investigating and
prosecuting crimes.

 

                   The weighing and
balancing which must be undertaken will vary with the facts presented on each
application.  Certainly in every case the requirements of s. 487 of the Code
must be met.  However, this is not the end of the matter.  Even after the
statutory conditions have been met it may still be a difficult and complex
process to determine whether a search warrant should be issued.  For example, a
greater degree of privacy may be expected in a home than in commercial premises
which may be subject to statutory regulation and inspection.  At the same time,
among commercial premises, the media are entitled to particularly careful
consideration, both as to the issuance of a search warrant and as to the
conditions that may be attached to a warrant to ensure that any disruption of
the gathering and dissemination of news is limited as much as possible.  The
media are entitled to this special consideration because of the importance of
their role in a democratic society.

 

                   In the companion
appeal Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), I
attempted to summarize the factors that must be taken into account in the
balancing process in determining whether a search warrant should be issued. 
They are as follows (at p. 000):

 

1)
It is essential that all the requirements set out in s. 487(1) (b) of the
Criminal Code  for the issuance of a search warrant be met.

 

2)
Once the statutory conditions have been met, the justice of the peace should
consider all of the circumstances in determining whether to exercise his or her
discretion to issue a warrant.

 

3)
The justice of the peace should ensure that a balance is struck between the
competing interests of the state in the investigation and prosecution of crimes
and the right to privacy of the media in the course of their news gathering and
news dissemination.  It must be borne in mind that the media play a vital role
in the functioning of a democratic society.  Generally speaking, the news media
will not be implicated in the crime under investigation.  They are truly an
innocent third party.  This is a particularly important factor to be considered
in attempting to strike an appropriate balance, including the consideration of
imposing conditions on that warrant.

 

4)
The affidavit in support of the application must contain sufficient detail to
enable the justice of the peace to properly exercise his or her discretion as
to the issuance of a search warrant.

 

5)
Although it is not a constitutional requirement, the affidavit material should ordinarily
disclose whether there are alternative sources from which the information may
reasonably be obtained and, if there is an alternative source, that it has been
investigated and all reasonable efforts to obtain the information have been
exhausted.

 

6)
If the information sought has been disseminated by the media in whole or in
part, this will be a factor which will favour the issuing of the search
warrant.

 

7)
If a justice of the peace determines that a warrant should be issued for the
search of media premises, consideration should then be given to the imposition
of some conditions on its implementation,  so that the media organization will
not be unduly impeded in the publishing or dissemination of the news.

 

8)
If, subsequent to the issuing of a search warrant, it comes to light the
authorities failed to disclose pertinent information that could well have
affected the decision to issue the warrant, this may result in a finding that
the warrant was invalid.

 

9)
Similarly, if the search itself is unreasonably conducted, this may render the
search invalid.

 

                   In this case the
crucial factor is that, prior to the application for the warrant, the media had
broadcast portions of the videotape depicting the commission of a crime on two
occasions, both in French and English. 

 

                   There can be no
doubt it would have been preferable if the affidavit material had indicated
that there was either no alternative source of information to the police or, if
there was, that the information sought could not be obtained from that
alternative source.  The failure to set that out is certainly a basis upon
which the justice of the peace could refuse to issue the search warrant.  As a
result, I would expect that in the future, this information would in most cases
be placed before the justice of the peace.

 

                   However, this is
not a constitutionally required condition for the issuance of a search
warrant.  It is to be noted that factually, this case is far different from Pacific
Press, supra.  There, the search interfered with the operations of
the media and delayed the publication of the newspaper.  Here the search was
conducted reasonably and did not affect the operations of the news media. 
Further, there is no indication that the police were at the scene or even aware
of the crime when the film was made.  It is reasonable to infer that they, like
other members of the public, learned the details of the crime from the
broadcast. 

 

                   It must be
remembered that all members of the community have an interest in seeing that
crimes are investigated and prosecuted.  In a situation such as this, the media
might even consider voluntarily delivering their videotapes to the police.  For
example, if the tapes depicted a murder being committed and means of
identifying the killer, would the media seek to withhold the tapes on the
grounds that to release them would have a chilling effect on their sources and
thus interfere with freedom of the press?  I trust that such a position would
not be taken.

 

                   In any event, once
the news media have published the gathered information, that information then
passes into the public domain.  The publication of that information is a very
important factor for the justice of the peace to consider.  This is something
that favours the issuing of a search warrant.  When a crime has been committed
and evidence of that crime has been published, society has every right to
expect that it will be investigated and, if appropriate, prosecuted.  Here, the
publication or broadcasting of the information was a factor of sufficient
importance to enable the justice of the peace to exercise his discretion and
issue the search warrant notwithstanding the failure of the police to explain
that there was no alternative source available that would give them the
information contained in the videotape.

 

                   The failure to set
out the lack of alternative sources was simply another factor to be taken into
account in assessing the reasonableness of the search.  Here, the actual search
was conducted reasonably and properly.  There was no interference with the
operation of the news media, nor was the freedom of the press threatened.  The
media had already completed their basic function of news gathering and news
dissemination; thus, in my view, the seizure of the tapes at this stage could
not be said to have a chilling effect on the media's sources of news.  It was
therefore  appropriate for the justice of the peace to issue the search warrant
in this case.

 

Disposition

 

                   I would allow the
appeal and restore the order of Durand J.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by 

 

//McLachlin J.//

 

                   McLachlin
J. (dissenting) -- Having
concluded that the search and seizure by the police in this case infringed the
freedom of the press and media guaranteed by s. 2 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , I must respectfully disagree with the
reasons of my colleagues, Justices Cory and L'Heureux-Dubé. 

 

                   The central issue
on this appeal is the scope of the constitutional guarantee of freedom of the
press and how it is to be reconciled to the public interest in permitting the
police to have access to information relevant to the commission of offences. 
Unlike my colleagues,  I hold the view that this issue requires the court to
confront squarely two questions:  (1)  whether search and seizure of the press
offends s. 2 (b) of the Charter , and (2) if so, the conditions, if
any, on which such search and seizure can be justified under s. 1 .  Analyzing
s. 2(b) in the light of principles laid down in other cases, it is my conclusion
that the search here in question violates s. 2 (b) of the Charter 
and that the violation was not shown to be justified under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

The Issue

 

                   Section 487  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , permits a justice of the peace to issue a
warrant for the search of premises and seizure of things found on the premises
where the justice is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe
that items relevant to the commission of an offence may be found on the
premises.  The section applies to all premises, including those of the press.

 

                   The section does
not expressly confer on a justice of the peace a discretion to consider any
factor other than whether evidence relevant to the commission of a crime might
be found on the premises.  However, the phrase ""may . . .
issue a warrant"" has permitted the courts to take the view that there may
be some circumstances where other countervailing factors can and ought to be
considered in the exercise of the justice's ""judicial discretion"".  It
is not necessary for the purposes of this case to assume a general discretion
in every case to consider factors such as a householder's privacy in
determining whether a warrant should issue.  I content myself with the
interpretation of s. 487  adopted by this Court in Descôteaux v. Mierzwinski,
[1982] 1 S.C.R. 860, at pp. 889-90, where Lamer J. (as he then was) said that
the justice has a right to refuse to issue a warrant in ""special
circumstances"",  such as ""where the search would interfere with
rights as fundamental as freedom of the press"".

 

                   The general
constitutionality of s. 487  is not challenged.  Rather, what is at issue is the
exercise by the justices of the peace of their discretion to refuse a warrant
in special circumstances: Descôteaux, supra.  It is submitted
that searches and seizures on press premises can be permitted only in special
circumstances where it is established that the state's interest in the
administration of justice outweighs the interest in freedom of the press.  Our
task is to determine whether search and/or seizure on press premises infringes
freedom of the press under s. 2 (b) of the Charter , and if so,  to
define those circumstances, if any, in which the limitation on freedom of the
press imposed by a search or seizure on press premises can be justified under
s. 1  of the Charter .  It will then be for justices of the peace hearing
applications for search warrants to conduct themselves in accordance with the Charter : 
Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038, at p.
1080 per Lamer J. (as he then was), and at p. 1048 per Dickson
C.J.  The result in this appeal will depend on whether the justice acted within
the constraints imposed by the Charter .

 

Freedom of the Press: s. 2 (b)
of the Charter 

 

                   The Constitution of
Canada guarantees freedom of the press and media:

 

                   2.  Everyone has the following
fundamental freedoms:

                                                                   .

(b)
freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the
press and other media of communication;

 

                   By specifically
referring to freedom of the press, s. 2 (b) affirms the special position
of the press and other media in our society.  It affirms that the press and the
media have the constitutional right to pursue their legitimate functions in our
society.  Freedom of the press under the Charter  must be interpreted in
a generous and liberal fashion having regard to the history of the guarantee
and focusing on the purpose of the guarantee: see Edmonton Journal v.
Alberta (Attorney General), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1326 (per Cory J.); R.
v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295 (per Dickson J.); Hunter
v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145 (per Dickson J.) at pp. 156 et
seq.

 

                   The history of
freedom of the press in Canada belies the notion the press can be treated like
other citizens or legal entities when its activities come into conflict with
the state. Long before the enactment of the Charter , the courts
recognized the special place of the press in a free and democratic society.  In
England the matter was succinctly summarized by Denning M.R. in Senior v.
Holdsworth, Ex parte Independent Television News Ltd., [1976] 1 Q.B. 23
(C.A.), at p. 34 :

 

. .
.there is the special position of the journalist or reporter who gathers news
of public concern.  The courts respect his work and will not hamper it more
than is necessary.

 

                   Canadian courts
prior to the Charter  recognized the fundamental importance of freedom of
expression and the press and gave it quasi-constitutional status, striking down
laws which violated it:

 

                   Reference Re
Alberta Statutes,
[1938] S.C.R. 100.

 

                   Boucher v. The King, [1951] S.C.R. 265.

 

                   Switzman v. Elbling, [1957] S.C.R. 285.

 

                   Fraser v. Public
Service Staff Relations Board, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 455.

 

This tradition was aptly summarized by
McIntyre J. in RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573, at
pp. 583-84:

 

Freedom
of expression is not, however, a creature of the Charter .  It is one of
the fundamental concepts that has formed the basis for the historical
development of the political, social and educational institutions of western
society.  Representative democracy, as we know it today, which is in great part
the product of free expression and discussion of varying ideas, depends upon
its maintenance and protection.

 

. . .

 

                   Prior
to the adoption of the Charter , freedom of speech and expression had
been recognized as an essential feature of Canadian parliamentary democracy. 
Indeed, this Court may be said to have given it constitutional status. 

 

                   Even prior to the Charter ,
the special position of the press was recognized as sufficient to oust the
usual rights of the police to gather information by search and seizure: Re
Pacific Press Ltd. and the Queen (1977), 37 C.C.C. (2d) 487 (B.C.S.C.); Descôteaux
v. Mierzwinski, supra.  The position of the press can be no less
privileged under the Charter .

 

                   I pass from the
history of the freedom of expression in Canada to the purpose of the
guarantee.  The values underlying freedom of the press, like freedom of
expression, include the pursuit of truth.  The press furthers that pursuit by
reporting on facts and opinions and  offering its comment on events and ideas -
activities vital to the functioning of our democracy, which is premised on the
free reporting and interchange of ideas.  The press acts as the agent of the
public in monitoring and reporting on governmental, legal and social
institutions:  Vickery v. Nova Scotia Supreme Court (Prothonotary),
[1991] 1 S.C.R. 671,  per Cory J.; Edmonton Journal v. Alberta
(Attorney General), supra, per Cory J;  Law Reform Commission
of Canada: Public and Media Access to the Criminal Process (Working
Paper 56, 1987), chap. 1 at pp. 9-11.  Freedom of the press is also important
to participation in the community and individual self-fulfillment.  One need only
think of the role of a community newspaper in facilitating community
participation, or the role of arts, sports and policy publications to see the
importance of freedom of the press to these goals. We thus see that the values
identified in Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1989] 1
S.C.R. 927, as central to free expression, also underlie the guarantee of
freedom of the press and media.  As to the means by which these purposes are to
be achieved, it may be ventured that an effective and free press is dependent
on its ability to gather, analyze and disseminate information, independent from
any state imposed restrictions on content, form or perspective except those
justified under s. 1  of the Charter . 

 

                   The ways in which
police search and seizure may impinge on the values underlying freedom of the
press are manifest.  First, searches may be physically disruptive and impede
efficient and timely publication.  Second, retention of seized material by the
police may delay or forestall completing the dissemination of the news. Third,
confidential sources of information may be fearful of speaking to the press,
and the press may lose opportunities to cover various events because of fears
on the part of participants that press files will be readily available to the
authorities.  Fourth, reporters may be deterred from recording and preserving
their recollections for future use.  Fifth, the processing of news and its
dissemination may be chilled by the prospect that searches will disclose
internal editorial deliberations.  Finally, the press may resort to
self-censorship to conceal the fact that it possesses information that may be
of interest to the police in an effort to protect its sources and its ability
to gather news in the future. All this may adversely impact on the role of the
media in furthering the search for truth, community participation and
self-fulfillment. 

 

                   With deference to
Cory J., I cannot accept that the fact that a portion of the material seized
may have been published negates the chilling effect seizure might have on
informants and the press itself.  The fact that a portion of the material has
been published does not negate the fact that other portions adversely affecting
the privacy of press informants may be disclosed as a consequence of the
search.  But more fundamentally, it is the prospect of seizure of press
material in future cases without the imposition of conditions to protect press
freedom and the identity of informants which creates the chilling effect.  The
fact that some of the material may have been published in no way diminishes
such fears.

 

                   I add that it is
not every state restriction on the press which infringes s. 2 (b).  Press
activities which are not related to the values fundamental to freedom of the
press may not merit Charter  protection: see Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec
(Attorney General), supra.  For example, the press might not be
entitled to Charter  protection with respect to documents relating to an
alleged offence by the press itself. 

 

                   The press activity
at issue in this case -- gathering and disseminating information about a labour
demonstration -- is directly related to the furtherance of the values of truth,
community participation and self-fulfillment that underlie the guarantee of
free expression.  It follows that such search and seizure infringes freedom of
the press as guaranteed by s. 2 (b) of the Charter .

 

                   This, however, is
not the end of the analysis.  The more difficult question is how freedom of the
press is to be reconciled with society's interest in the administration of
justice and the conviction of the guilty.  Under the  Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms , that analysis takes place under the rubric of s. 1  of
the Charter .

 

Justification Under s. 1 of the Charter 

 

                   Section 1  of the Charter 
provides:

 

                   1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to
such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a
free and democratic society.

 

                   The first question
is whether there may ever be circumstances in which a search and/or
seizure on press premises infringing s. 2 (b) can be justified under s.
1 .  Pre-Charter  jurisprudence suggests that search and seizure of press
material may be justified in appropriate circumstances, as in the case where
there is no alternative source of the relevant evidence: Pacific Press, supra. 
The same view has been taken in the United States: Zurcher v. Stanford Daily,
436 U.S. 547 (1978).  Denying the police the power ever to search press offices
or seize press documents would have the advantage of eliminating ex parte
hearings and the spectre of police in a newsroom rifling though press files. 
But, since a subpoena cannot be issued for purely investigatory processes, such
a policy would effectively preclude police access to information in the hands
of the press at the investigation stage.  Access to information in the hands of
the press at an investigatory stage may be extremely important -- sufficiently
important in fact to outweigh the negative impact on freedom of the press of an
ex parte application and subsequent search and seizure.  Accordingly,
the argument that a warrant for search and seizure of an organ of the press can
never be made out must fail.

 

                   What we are faced
with then is the delicate task of finding the proper balance between the public
interest in the right of the press to conduct its activities free from state
interference, and the public interest in seeing that those guilty of offences
are charged and convicted.  To quote Lord Denning in Senior v. Holdsworth,
supra, at p. 34:

 

. .
. there is the special position of the journalist or reporter who gathers news
of public concern.  The courts respect his work and will not hamper it more
than is necessary.  They will seek to achieve a balance between these two
matters.  On the one hand there is the public interest which demands that the
course of justice should not be impeded by the withholding of
evidence. . . .  On the other hand, there is the public interest
in seeing that confidences are respected and that newsmen are not hampered by
fear of being compelled to disclose all the information which comes their
way. . . .

 

                   In my opinion, the
issuance of a warrant for search and for seizure of press information may be
justified provided the following conditions are met:

 

(l)
The search/seizure is necessary because there are no alternative sources for
the information required;

 

(2)
The importance of the search/seizure outweighs the damage to be caused by the
infringement of freedom of the press; and 

 

(3)
The warrant ensures that the search/seizure interferes with the press's freedom
as little as possible.

 

                   These requirements
mirror the concerns central to a s. 1  analysis as set out in R. v. Oakes,
[1986] 1 S.C.R. 103.  It goes without saying that the pressing objective
required by Oakes -- the effective prosecution and prevention of crime
-- will normally be established where the police seek evidence relevant to the
commission of an offence.  The requirement that the search be necessary (first
enunciated in Canada by Nemetz C.J. in Pacific Press, supra), is
in reality an insistence that there be a rational connection between the
infringing measure and the state objective; if there are other sources of
information, the necessary link between the infringement and the state goal
justifying it is absent.  The second and third elements of my proposed test
echo the remaining two branches of the proportionality test proposed in Oakes.

 

                   Given the seriousness
of any violation of freedom of the press, the justice of the peace must be
satisfied that the special requirements  for the issuance of a warrant of
search and seizure against a press agency are clearly established.  Bald
assertions of necessity or proportionality will not suffice.   They must be
backed up by more specific assertions.

 

                   For example, a
justice enquiring whether the warrant is made necessary by the absence of
alternative sources might well expect answers to questions like the following: 
Are there other sources known to the police?  Have the police made reasonable
efforts to find and utilize alternative sources?  Mere administrative
convenience will not suffice.

 

                   Similarly, in
weighing the seriousness of the invasion of press freedom against the
importance of the suspected evidence and the investigation, the justice might
ask questions like the following:  How serious is the alleged violation of the
law?  Is the search likely to disrupt the operations of the press organ?  What
is the likelihood of revealing the identity of informants in a way that may
inhibit future communications with the press?  Has the material already been
substantially published?  Can the search be conducted or the information
obtained in a way that will do little harm to the operations of the press now
and in the future?

 

                   The requirement
that the infringement go no further than is necessary to achieve the desired
object demands like particularity.  The justice should cast the warrant in
terms which reduce as far as possible the effects of the infringement.  Matters
such as timing, specificity of the items to be seized, and conditions
protecting the identity of informants may fall to be considered, as may the
manner in which the warrant is to be executed.  For example, where there is no
reason to believe the press will destroy the material or refuse to surrender
it, it might be reasonable for the warrant to require that the information be
surrendered rather than allowing the police to search the premises and seize
the materials.  (This appears to be a common practice at present.)

 

                   In some cases a
justice concerned to minimize impact or concerned as to whether the warrant
should issue at all may wish to receive representations from the press organ in
question, especially in circumstances where the need for the suspected evidence
is not particularly urgent and there is no reason to suspect that the evidence
in question will be concealed or destroyed. 

 

                   In summary, the
justice of the peace to whom an application for a warrant against the press is
made possesses jurisdiction to refuse the warrant or impose conditions on its
execution, so as to ensure that the limit on press freedom it represents is
justified under s. 1  of the Charter .  This is essential to ensure that
the action of the police in searching for and seizing press materials does not
violate the Charter .  Should more precision be deemed necessary it is
open to Parliament to enact legislation setting out special procedures
governing search and seizure on press premises, as it did in enacting s. 488.1 
of the Criminal Code , dealing with seizure of privileged documents,
after Descôteaux, supra.

 

Application of the Principles to this
Case

 

                   The warrant in the
case at bar does not comply with the requirements of the Charter .

 

                   The search of the
premises to obtain the video recordings of the vandalism which the police were
investigating and the subsequent seizure of a number of recordings violate the
freedom of the press guaranteed by s. 2 (b). While the aim of the search
and seizure was not to limit freedom of the press, that was the effect.  The
press activities represented by the tapes seized were directly related to the
legitimate pursuit of the values underlying the guarantee of press freedom and
were worthy of Charter  protection.  The search and seizure impinged on
the press's liberty.  The broadcaster's private offices were searched.  The
means by which it communicated the news to the public were seized and detained.
The fact that a portion of the material had already been published does not
detract from the fact that the broadcaster's legitimate press activities were
interfered with.  It follows that a breach of s. 2 (b) is established.

 

                   The search and
seizure are not shown to have been justified under s. 1  of the Charter . 
The warrant was issued notwithstanding the absence of any evidence that the
information could not be obtained elsewhere.  Nor was there any material to
permit the justice to weigh the importance of the search against the press
infringement and to ensure that it did not intrude on press freedom further
than necessary.  While it is not alleged that the police interfered with the
broadcaster's operations unduly, the absence of material enabling the justice
to conclude that the search and seizure were necessary and proportionate is
fatal.  Without such information, the Crown cannot justify its infringement of
press freedom under s. 1  of the Charter .

on appeal from the court of appeal for
ontario

 

Present:  Lamer C.J. and Gonthier,
Cory, McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ.

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Evidence ‑‑ Witnesses ‑‑ Competency ‑‑
Spouses ‑‑ Husband charged with using forged document after forging
wife's name on cheque and cashing it ‑‑ Spouses separated without
any reasonable possibility of reconciliation ‑‑ Whether wife of
accused competent witness for prosecution ‑‑ Whether appropriate
case for court to change common law rule of spousal incompetence.

 

                   The accused was
charged with using a forged document contrary to s. 368  of the Criminal
Code . He had signed his wife's name on a cheque payable to them jointly and
cashed it. At trial, the accused testified that he had his wife's authority to
do this.  The accused's wife, testifying for the Crown, denied giving him such
authority. The trial judge accepted her evidence and convicted the accused. At
the time of the offence, the accused and his wife were separated without any
reasonable possibility of reconciliation. The majority of the Court of Appeal
affirmed the conviction. This appeal raises only one question:  is there a
common law exception to the rule against spousal competence for spouses who are
separated without any reasonable possibility of reconciliation?

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   While complex
changes to the law with uncertain ramifications should be left to the
legislature, judges can and should  make incremental changes to the common law
to bring legal rules into step with a changing society when it is appropriate
to do so. Since the enactment of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ,
judges also have a duty to see that the common law develops in accordance with
the values of the Charter . Where the principles underlying a common law
rule are out of step with Charter  values, the courts should scrutinize
the rule closely. If it is possible to change the rule so as to make it
consistent with such values, without upsetting the proper balance between
judicial and legislative action, then the rule ought to be changed. This is an
appropriate case for a court to change the common law rule in order to make
spouses who are irreconcilably separated competent witnesses for the
prosecution.

 

                   It is apparent from
an examination of the history of the rule making a spouse an incompetent
witness for the prosecution that any policy justification which may at one time
have existed in support of the rule, including the preservation of marital
harmony, has now disappeared in the case of divorced or irreconcilably
separated spouses.  The rule, which followed naturally from the legal position
of the wife at the time, reflects a view of the role of women which is not
compatible with the importance now given to sexual equality.  In particular,
the rule making an irreconcilably separated spouse an incompetent witness is
inconsistent with the values enshrined in the Charter . The common law
rule of spousal incompetence involves a conflict between the capacity of the
individual to testify and the interests of society in preserving the marriage
bond.  Where spouses are irreconcilably separated, there is no marriage bond to
protect.  To give paramountcy to the marriage bond over the interests of
individual choice in cases of irreconcilable separation is thus inappropriate
in the age of the Charter . The Charter  requires that individual
choices not be restricted unnecessarily. Making a separated spouse a competent
witness for the prosecution may ultimately mean that an irreconcilably
separated spouse is also compellable at the instance of the prosecution;
however, this question was not raised on this appeal.

 

                   The amendments to
s. 4  of the Canada Evidence Act  do not indicate a parliamentary
intention to retain the common law rule of spousal incompetence as it presently
stands. The amendments made to the Act since 1906 were peripheral and largely
consequential to amendments to the Criminal Code .  They were made
without any recorded consideration of the scope of the common law rule and the
issues raised in this case.

//Iacobucci J.//

 

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

 

                   Iacobucci
J. -- This appeal raises
the question of the competence of a spouse who is separated from his or her
spouse without reasonable possibility of reconciliation to testify as a witness
for the prosecution.

 

I.  Facts

 

                   The appellant, Mr.
Pasquale Salituro, signed the name of his wife, Mrs. Carrie Salituro, on a
cheque payable jointly to her and to him.  It was admitted that the appellant signed
Mrs. Salituro's name and that he cashed the cheque, but the appellant's defence
was that he had his wife's authority to do so.  Mrs. Salituro denied this and
the trial judge accepted her evidence over the appellant's and convicted him of
forgery.  The trial judge concluded on the basis of the appellant's testimony
that the appellant and his wife were separated without any reasonable
possibility of reconciliation at the time the appellant forged his wife's
signature.

 

                   Without Mrs.
Salituro's testimony the appellant would not have been convicted.  The issue is
therefore whether Mrs. Salituro's testimony falls under an exception to the
common law rule that a spouse is an incompetent witness for the prosecution. 
Since this is an appeal as of right, the appeal is limited by s. 691(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , to questions of law on
which a judge of the court of appeal dissents.  As a result there is only one
question on this appeal: is there a common law exception to the rule against spousal
competence for spouses who are separated without any reasonable possibility of
reconciliation?

shall not be made the subject of comment by the judge or by counsel for the
prosecution.

III.  The Courts Below

 

A.  Provincial Court of
Ontario

 

                   BeGora Prov. Ct. J.
convicted the appellant of using a forged document contrary to s. 368  of the Criminal
Code .  Although Mrs. Salituro's testimony was essential to the appellant's
conviction, no objection was taken to the admissibility of her evidence at trial.

 

B.  Court of Appeal for
Ontario

 

                   The Court of Appeal
dismissed the appellant's appeal from conviction, but allowed his appeal from
sentence: (1990), 56 C.C.C. (3d) 350, 78 C.R. (3d) 68, 38 O.A.C. 241
(hereinafter cited to C.C.C.).  Galligan and Blair JJ.A. wrote separate
concurring reasons dismissing the appeal; Carthy J.A. dissented.

 

                   (1)  Reasons
of Galligan J.A.

 

                   Galligan J.A.
concluded that, as there were no sound reasons for applying the rule of spousal
incompetence to spouses who are separated without reasonable hope of
reconciliation, the rule should not be applied in this case.

 

                   Galligan J.A. began
by noting that while the rule of spousal incompetence has been subject to much
criticism, its continuing existence has been recognized by at least two recent
Ontario Court of Appeal judgments.  The only remaining rationale for the rule
is that it supports marital harmony.  Given that there is no marital harmony to
preserve if spouses are separated without reasonable hope of reconciliation,
Galligan J.A. concluded that there is no sound policy reason to apply the rule
in this case.

 

                   Galligan J.A. cited
the judgment of McLachlin J. in Watkins v. Olafson, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 750,
as support for the proposition that the courts may, in limited circumstances,
change a rule of the common law.  Acknowledging that such changes should be
slow and incremental, Galligan J.A. concluded that the change proposed to the
rule against spousal competence was a small step beyond the change to the
common law already effected in R. v. Bailey (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 21
(Ont. C.A.), and in R. v. Marchand (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 77 (N.S.S.C.,
App. Div.), of dissolving spousal immunity on divorce.

 

                   On the appeal from
sentence, considering the facts that the accused had no previous record and
that the pre‑sentence report was a favourable one, Galligan J.A. varied
the sentence from one year's imprisonment to a sentence of time already served.

 

                   (2)  Reasons
of Blair J.A.

 

                   In a comprehensive
judgment, Blair J.A. examined in detail the rationale for the common law rule,
the evolution of the rule, the effects of legislative intervention, and the
principles governing judicial changes to the common law.  In the end, he
concurred with his colleague Galligan J.A., and dismissed the appeal.

 

                   Blair J.A. found
that the only policy rationale for the rule that survives is that the rule
preserves marital harmony and he characterized this rationalization as
unrealistic where spouses have separated.  He cited at p. 354 the following
passage from McCormick on Evidence (3rd ed. 1984):

 

(F)amily
harmony is nearly always past saving when the spouse is willing to aid the
prosecution.  The privilege is an archaic survival of mystical religious dogma
and of a way of thinking about the marital relation that is today outmoded.  

 

                   Blair J.A. noted
that the traditional exceptions to the common law rule have been expanded, and
the scope of the rule restricted, by both s. 4  of the Canada Evidence Act ,
and recent judicial decisions.  In R. v. Czipps (1979), 48 C.C.C. (2d)
166 (Ont. C.A.), and in R. v. Sillars (1978), 45 C.C.C. (2d) 283
(B.C.C.A.), the courts held that a spouse is competent and compellable even if
the charge does not allege that the accused spouse had threatened the person,
liberty or health of the other spouse, provided the evidence discloses such a
threat.  This result was the opposite to that which had been arrived at in
England.  Similarly, in R. v. MacPherson (1980), 52 C.C.C. (2d) 547, the
Nova Scotia Court of Appeal concluded that a wife was competent to testify
against her husband accused of assault against a child of the marriage,
adopting the earlier decision of Borins Co. Ct. J. in R. v. McNamara
(1979), 48 C.C.C. (2d) 201 (Ont.).

 

                   In R. v. Bailey,
supra, the Ontario Court of Appeal refused to follow the English Court of
Criminal Appeal's decision in R. v. Algar, [1954] 1 Q.B. 279, following
instead the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in Marchand, supra, and
held that a divorced spouse was competent to testify against the other divorced
spouse.  Both the Ontario and Nova Scotia decisions looked to the underlying
policy justification for the rule ‑‑ the preservation of marital
harmony ‑‑ in arriving at their results.

 

                   Blair J.A. also
observed that the common law rule of spousal incompetence is in need of
legislative reform (at p. 357):

 

                   The
present common law rule governing spousal testimony in criminal cases is almost
universally recognized as archaic, anomalous and inconsistent with the factual
and legal position of spouses in modern society.  It cries out for
comprehensive legislative reform....  

 

                   Blair J.A. then
reviewed the history of legislative changes to the statutory scheme in s. 4  of
the Canada Evidence Act .  He concluded that the section has not been
materially altered since 1906.  The changes made to s. 4  have been peripheral
(at p. 359):

 

Viewed
in their proper context, it is clear that the amendments to s. 4 of the Act in
this century do not have the sweeping effect attributed to them by Carthy J.A.
The amendments were not made as parts of a comprehensive revision of the Act
and the common law rule and its exceptions such as that recommended by the law
reform reports referred to above.  The amendments, on the contrary, were
peripheral and largely consequential to amendments to the Code.  They
were made without any recorded consideration of the scope of the common law
rule and the issues raised in this case.  It is unrealistic to suggest that,
when making these amendments, Parliament directed its mind to all the ramifications
of the common law rule and its exceptions.  

 

                   Blair J.A. also
considered the role of the courts in effecting changes to the common law.  In
advancing the proposed change to the rule of spousal incompetence, Blair J.A.
agreed with Borins Co. Ct. J. in R. v. McNamara, supra, that it
was significant that the court was not being asked to abolish a rule of the
common law, but to extend it.  There are in fact no judicial decisions binding
on the court holding that separated spouses are incompetent witnesses against
one another.  Furthermore, the difficulties for courts in appreciating economic
and policy issues, recognized by McLachlin J. in Watkins, supra,
are not relevant in this case, because the change is not a dramatic one (at p.
361):

 

                   None
of these practical impediments exist in the present case.  This court, on the
basis of the material before it, is quite capable of deciding that the
extension of the exception to the common law rule of spousal testimonial
incompetency of permanently and irrevocably separated spouses will operate
beneficially to protect their interests and will conform with the realities of
the present age.  The extension of the exception in this case to separated
spouses, whose legal status has been recognized by statute, flows naturally
from our extension of the rule to divorced persons in Bailey...

 

                   Blair J.A.
therefore dismissed the appeal and concurred in the disposition on sentence
proposed by Galligan J.A.

 

                   (3)  Dissenting
Reasons of Carthy J.A.

 

                   Carthy J.A. agreed
with his two colleagues that the common law rule of spousal incompetence is
anachronistic and inappropriate for application to the facts of this particular
case.  He dissented on the grounds that Parliament has legislated and so given
implicit recognition to the common law rule.

 

                   Carthy J.A. noted
that the fact that Parliament has created specific statutory exceptions to the
common law rule, ""leaves no doubt that Parliament scrutinized the issue
with knowledge and recognition of the limitations of the common law rule and
exception"" (p. 364).  Carthy J.A. noted in particular the combined effect
of s. 329 of the Code and s. 4(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act  as
evidence that Parliament turned its mind expressly to the separation of
spouses.

 

                   Carthy J.A. also
noted that, while the effect of the decisions in Bailey and Marchand,
supra, which created an exception to the rule for divorced spouses, was
to harmonize the rule with the scope of the privilege for marital
communications, the proposed change would conflict with the legislative scheme
by creating inconsistencies with s. 4(2)  and (4)  of the Canada Evidence Act ,
which make the ""wife or husband"" of a person charged with certain
offences competent and compellable.  These sections refer simply to ""wife
or husband"" and not to a ""separated"" wife or husband.  As a
result, Carthy J.A. argued that, ""[i]ncompetence under the common law rule
would be for a more restricted period than the exceptions recited in s. 4(2) 
and (4)  [of the Canada Evidence Act ]"" (p. 365).

 

                   Carthy J.A. also
pointed to the fact that the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. D‑8,
encourages reconciliation until trial, in ss. 7 and 8.  Carthy J.A. took this
to mean that Parliament has emphasized that marriage lasts until divorce.

 

                   In the result,
Carthy J.A. would have allowed the appeal and quashed the conviction.

 

IV.  Issue

 

                   The only issue
which arises in this appeal is the following:

 

Is
the spouse of an accused a competent witness for the prosecution if he or she
is separated from the accused without any reasonable possibility of
reconciliation?

 

V.  Analysis

 

                   I say at the outset
that I would dismiss the appeal.  In arriving at this result, I have considered
three issues: the appropriate limits on the power of judges to change the
common law, the policy rationale for the common law rule making a spouse
(including an irreconcilably separated one) an incompetent witness, and whether
it is appropriate to make the proposed change to the common law given the
pattern of legislation that exists.  I conclude that judges do have the power
to make some changes to the common law, that there are sound policy reasons for
making the proposed change in this case, and that the pattern of legislation
does not indicate a contrary parliamentary intention to preserve the common law
rule.  I shall now discuss each of these conclusions in turn.

 

A.  What Are the Limits
on the Power of Judges to Change the Common Law?

 

                   (1)  Introduction

 

                   At one time, it was
accepted that it was the role of judges to discover the common law, not to
change it.  In Book One of his Commentaries on the Laws of England (4th
ed. 1770), Sir William Blackstone propounded a view of the common law as fixed
and unchanging, at p. 69:

 

For
it is an established rule to abide by former precedents, where the same points
come again in litigation; as well to keep the scale of justice even and steady,
and not liable to waver with every new judge's opinion; as also because the law
in that case being solemnly declared and determined, what before was uncertain,
and perhaps indifferent, is now become a permanent rule, which it is not in the
breast of any subsequent judge to alter or vary from, according to his private
sentiments, he being sworn to determine, not according to his own private
judgment, but according to the known laws and customs of the land; not
delegated to pronounce a new law, but to maintain and expound the old one.

 

                   However,
Blackstone's static model of the common law has gradually been supplanted by a
more dynamic view.  This Court is now willing, where there are compelling
reasons for doing so, to overturn its own previous decisions.  Prior to the
abolition of appeals to the Privy Council in 1949, this Court considered itself
bound by its own prior decisions: Stuart v. Bank of Montreal (1909), 41
S.C.R. 516.  However, since 1949, this Court has been prepared to overturn its
own decisions in appropriate cases: see for example, Reference Re Farm
Products Marketing Act, [1957] S.C.R. 198, at p. 212, Bell v. The Queen,
[1979] 2 S.C.R. 212, at pp. 219‑20, and Minister of Indian Affairs and
Northern Development v. Ranville, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 518, at p. 527.   I note
that similar developments have occurred in England.  In 1966, the House of
Lords issued a practice statement which reversed its long‑standing
practice of treating its own prior decisions as binding in every case.  In Practice
Statement (Judicial Precedent), [1966] 1 W.L.R. 1234, the court recognised
that rigidly adhering to precedent could interfere with the proper development
of the law (at p. 1234):

 

                   Their
Lordships ... recognise that too rigid adherence to precedent may lead to
injustice in a particular case and also unduly restrict the proper development
of the law.  They propose, therefore, to modify their present practice and,
while treating former decisions of this House as normally binding, to depart
from a previous decision when it appears right to do so.

 

                   The High Court of
Australia has adopted a similarly flexible approach to the common law in the
wake of the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council in 1975: see Viro v.
The Queen (1978), 141 C.L.R. 88.

 

                   (2)  Limits
on the Power of the Courts to Change the Common Law

 

                   In keeping with
these developments, this Court has signalled its willingness to adapt and
develop common law rules to reflect changing circumstances in society at
large.  In four recent cases, Ares v. Venner, [1970] S.C.R. 608, Watkins
v. Olafson, supra, R. v. Khan, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531, and R.
v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, this Court has laid down guidelines for
the exercise of the power to develop the common law.  The common theme of these
cases is that, while complex changes to the law with uncertain ramifications
should be left to the legislature, the courts can and should make incremental
changes to the common law to bring legal rules into step with a changing
society.  However, a brief review of these cases is warranted.

 

                   The issue in Ares,
supra, was whether it was appropriate to create a new exception to the
hearsay rule for hospital records.  Speaking for the Court, Hall J. adopted the
reasons of Lord Donovan in Myers v. Director of Public Prosecutions,
[1965] A.C. 1001, and accepted that the proposed new exception was required in
consequence of changes in the business environment which could not have been
foreseen at the time the hearsay rule was being developed.  Hall J. rejected
the argument that changes to the common law can only be made by Parliament.  In
support of his decision making hospital records admissible under a new exception
to the hearsay rule, Hall J. quoted the following passage from the reasons of
Lord Donovan in Myers at p. 1047:

 

The
common law is moulded by the judges and it is still their province to adapt it
from time to time so as to make it serve the interests of those it binds. 
Particularly is this so in the field of procedural law.

 

                   Hall J. followed
the minority in Myers, supra.  However, the majority in Myers
was not of the opinion that the courts should never change common law rules,
but only of the view that a change was not appropriate under the circumstances
of the case.  In the words of Lord Reid, at p. 1021:

 

                   I
have never taken a narrow view of the functions of this House as an appellate
tribunal.  The common law must be developed to meet changing economic
conditions and habits of thought, and I would not be deterred by expressions of
opinion in this House in old cases.  But there are limits to what we can or
should do.  If we are to extend the law it must be by the development and
application of fundamental principles.  We cannot introduce arbitrary
conditions or limitations: that must be left to legislation.

 

                   The more recent
decision of this Court in Watkins v. Olafson, supra, provides
some indication of the proper limits on the power of the judiciary to change
existing law.  At issue was an award of damages in a tort action.  The Manitoba
Court of Appeal had set aside a lump sum payment for future care and
substituted periodic payments.  Also questioned in the appeal to this Court was
the appropriateness of the gross‑up for taxation allowed by the trial
judge.

 

                   McLachlin J.
reinstated the lump sum payment awarded by the trial judge, on the grounds that
the change made to the law by the Court of Appeal was the kind of major
revision which should properly be left to the legislature.  She held that the
courts should not effect major changes to the law with complex ramifications
(at pp. 760‑61):

 

                   This
branch of the case, viewed thus, raises starkly the question of the limits on
the power of the judiciary to change the law.  Generally speaking, the
judiciary is bound to apply the rules of law found in the legislation and in
the precedents.  Over time, the law in any given area may change; but the
process of change is a slow and incremental one, based largely on the mechanism
of extending an existing principle to new circumstances.  While it may be that
some judges are more activist than others, the courts have generally declined
to introduce major and far‑reaching changes in the rules hitherto
accepted as governing the situation before them.

 

                   There
are sound reasons supporting this judicial reluctance to dramatically recast
established rules of law.  The court may not be in the best position to assess
the deficiencies of the existing law, much less problems which may be
associated with the changes it might make.  The court has before it a single
case; major changes in the law should be predicated on a wider view of how the
rule will operate in the broad generality of cases.  Moreover, the court may
not be in a position to appreciate fully the economic and policy issues underlying
the choice it is asked to make.  Major changes to the law often involve
devising subsidiary rules and procedures relevant to their implementation, a
task which is better accomplished through consultation between courts and
practitioners than by judicial decree.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly,
there is the long‑established principle that in a constitutional
democracy it is the legislature, as the elected branch of government, which
should assume the major responsibility for law reform.

 

                   Considerations
such as these suggest that major revisions of the law are best left to the
legislature.  Where the matter is one of a small extension of existing rules to
meet the exigencies of a new case and the consequences of the change are
readily assessable, judges can and should vary existing principles.  But where
the revision is major and its ramifications complex, the courts must proceed
with great caution.

 

McLachlin J. identified a number of
major difficulties with periodic payments which courts would have difficulty
responding to, including the fact that legal obligations between the parties
would not be finally resolved and would require supervision, presumably through
repeated court appearances.

 

                   McLachlin J. came
to the opposite conclusion on the issue of ""gross‑up"" for
taxation of the award.  She noted that the jurisprudence on the issue was
recent and unsettled, in spite of an earlier Supreme Court decision in which
this Court had declined to consider the impact of taxation on the award for future
care, namely Andrews v. Grand & Toy Alberta Ltd, [1978] 2 S.C.R.
229.  She also noted that there were strong policy reasons for taking the
impact of taxation into account, in that an award would not be fair to the
plaintiff if taxation were not considered in calculating the amount of the
award.  As well, calculating the amount of the award that would be lost to tax
would not present any great difficulty.  For these reasons, McLachlin J.
concluded that this was the kind of incremental change that the courts can and
should make to the common law, and she therefore upheld the gross‑up for
taxation allowed by the trial judge.

 

                   In R. v. Khan,
supra, the Court was called upon to respond to issues similar to those
that arose in Ares v. Venner, supra.  At issue was the
admissibility of statements made by a child to an adult concerning sexual
abuse.  The evidence was inadmissible hearsay according to the law as it then
stood.  In deciding to create a new exception to the hearsay rule, McLachlin J.
adopted a flexible approach to the articulation and development of the hearsay
rule (and by implication to the development of the common law in general),
grounded in principle and policy as well as in precedent (at p. 540):

 

                   The
hearsay rule has traditionally been regarded as an absolute rule, subject to
various categories of exceptions....  While this approach has provided a degree
of certainty to the law on hearsay, it has frequently proved unduly inflexible
in dealing with new situations and new needs in the law.  This has resulted in
courts in recent years on occasion adopting a more flexible approach, rooted in
the principle and the policy underlying the hearsay rule rather than the
strictures of traditional exceptions.

 

                   Finally, in R.
v. Seaboyer, supra, McLachlin J. again recognized the power of the
courts to change the common law.  She recognized that judges may broaden rules
of evidence to conform to their sense of justice, at p. 622:

 

The
judges perceived that the rules of evidence were unfairly restricting the right
to bring relevant and helpful evidence before the court, thereby undermining
the ability of the court to find the truth and do justice.  So the courts
broadened the rule to conform to their sense of justice by permitting judges
convinced of the reliability and trustworthiness of the evidence to admit it
despite its failure to conform to the traditional exceptions to the hearsay
rule.

 

                   (3)  Conclusion

 

                   These cases reflect
the flexible approach that this Court has taken to the development of the
common law.  Judges can and should adapt the common law to reflect the changing
social, moral and economic fabric of the country.  Judges should not be quick
to perpetuate rules whose social foundation has long since disappeared. 
Nonetheless, there are significant constraints on the power of the judiciary to
change the law.  As McLachlin J. indicated in Watkins, supra, in
a constitutional democracy such as ours it is the legislature and not the
courts which has the major responsibility for law reform; and for any changes
to the law which may have complex ramifications,  however necessary or
desirable such changes may be, they should be left to the legislature.  The
judiciary should confine itself to those incremental changes which are
necessary to keep the common law in step with the dynamic and evolving fabric
of our society.

 

B.  The Policy of the
Rule that a Spouse Is an Incompetent Witness for the

    Prosecution

 

                   From an examination
of the history of the rule making a spouse an incompetent witness for the
prosecution, it is apparent that any policy justification which may at one time
have existed in support of the rule has now disappeared in the context of divorced
or irreconcilably separated spouses.  The rule reflects a view of the role of
women which is no longer compatible with the importance now given to sexual
equality.  In particular, the rule making an irreconcilably separated spouse an
incompetent witness is inconsistent with the values enshrined in the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and preserving the rule would be contrary
to this Court's duty to see that the common law develops in accordance with the
values of the Charter .

 

                   (1)  The
Origins of the Rule in General

 

                   The first clear
authority for the rule that a spouse is not a competent witness is Lord Coke's Institutes
of the Laws of England, originally published in 1628.  The rule was
initially concerned only with the testimonial incompetence of wives: a wife was
an incompetent witness for or against her husband.  Lord Coke described the
rule as follows (1 Inst. 6b.):

 

Note, it hath been resolved by the
justices, that a wife cannot be produced either against or for her husband, quia
sunt duae animae in carne unâ; and it might be a cause of implacable
discord and dissention between the husband and the wife, and a meane of great
inconvenience...  

 

The rule that a wife was an
incompetent witness for or against her husband followed naturally from the
legal position of a wife at the time.  On marriage, a woman lost her
independent legal identity.  Blackstone, supra, described the legal
status of a married woman as follows, at p. 442 of Book 1:

 

                   By
marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is, the very being
or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage, or at least
is incorporated and consolidated into that of the husband; under whose wing,
protection, and cover, she performs every thing; and is therefore called
in our law-french a feme-covert, f{oe}mina viro co-operta; is said to be
covert-baron, or under the protection and influence of her husband, her baron,
or lord; and her condition during her marriage is called her coverture.

 

The general testimonial incompetence
of a wife for or against her husband was accepted in Lord Audley's Case
(1631), Hutt. 115, 123 E.R. 1140, at p. 1141.

 

                   (2)  Justifications
for the Rule

 

                   Since that time, at
least four distinct justifications have been advanced for the rule but only two
of these survive today.  The most important justification is that the rule
protects marital harmony.  The danger to marital harmony of making a spouse a
competent witness was first mentioned by Lord Coke, and was most recently
emphasized in the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case at bar, in R.
v. Bailey, supra, and in R v. Sillars, supra.  A second reason
sometimes mentioned is what Wigmore called the ""natural repugnance
to every fair‑minded person to compelling a wife or husband to be the
means of the other's condemnation"" (Wigmore on Evidence (McNaughton
rev. 1961), vol. 8, p. 217, {SS} 2228 (emphasis in original)).

 

                   The two
justifications which have not survived are that a spouse is an incompetent
witness because husband and wife are in law a single person (although this
justification survived into the eighteenth century), and that husband and wife
are disqualified from being witnesses for or against each other because their
interests are identical.

 

                   The policy grounds
supporting the rule have come in for sustained attack.  Wigmore scathingly
criticizes the variety of inconsistent arguments used to support the rule (at
p. 213):

 

                   The
record of judicial ratiocination defining the grounds and policy of this
privilege forms one of the most curious and entertaining chapters of the law of
evidence.  It is curious because the variety of ingenuity displayed, in the
invention of reasons ""ex post facto"" for a rule so simple and so long
accepted, could hardly have been believed but for the recorded utterances.... 
We behold the fantastic spectacle of a fundamental rule of evidence, which had
only questionable reasons for existence, surviving nonetheless through two
centuries upon the strength of certain artificial dogmas ‑‑
pronouncements wholly irreconcilable with each other, with the facts of life
and with the rule itself, and yet repeatedly invoked, with smug judicial
positiveness, like magic formulas to still the specter of forensic doubt.

 

                   In the study paper
""Competence and Compellability"" by the Evidence Project of the Law
Reform Commission of Canada, the rule was characterized as more a product of
history than the reflection of any clear policy decision:

 

. .
.  the rule, rather than the reflection of a clear-cut fundamental policy
decision, appears to be simply a product of history.  This is confirmed when we
note that a fundamental policy decision surely would be based on concern not
only for the married couple but for the family unit as a whole, and yet no one
has suggested legislation making fathers and sons or mothers and daughters
incompetent witnesses for the prosecution against their parents or children.

 

(Evidence (1972), Study Paper
No. 1, at p. 5.)

 

                   There is in my
opinion a more fundamental difficulty with the reasons for the rule.  The
grounds which have been used in support of the rule are inconsistent with
respect for the freedom of all individuals, which has become a central tenet of
the legal and moral fabric of this country particularly since the adoption of
the Charter .  In R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295,
Dickson J. (as he then was) defined freedom in this way (at p. 336):
""Freedom must surely be founded in respect for the inherent dignity and
the inviolable rights of the human person.""  The common law rule making a
spouse an incompetent witness involves a conflict between the right of the
individual to choose freely whether or not to testify and the interests of
society in preserving the marriage bond.  It is unnecessary for me to consider
the difficult question of how this conflict ought to be resolved, because in
this appeal we are concerned only with spouses who are irreconcilably
separated.  Where spouses are irreconcilably separated, there is no marriage
bond to protect and we are faced only with a rule which limits the capacity of
the individual to testify.

 

                   To give paramountcy
to the marriage bond over the right of individual choice in cases of
irreconcilable separation may have been appropriate in Lord Coke's time, when a
woman's legal personality was incorporated in that of her husband on marriage,
but it is inappropriate in the age of the Charter .  As Wilson J. put it
in R. v. Morgentaler, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 30, at p. 166, the Charter 
requires that individual choices not be restricted unnecessarily.

 

                   The
idea of human dignity finds expression in almost every right and freedom
guaranteed in the Charter .  Individuals are afforded the right to choose
their own religion and their own philosophy of life, the right to choose with
whom they will associate and how they will express themselves, the right to
choose where they will live and what occupation they will pursue.  These are
all examples of the basic theory underlying the Charter , namely that the
state will respect choices made by individuals and, to the greatest extent
possible, will avoid subordinating these choices to any one conception of the
good life.

 

                   Through its family
and divorce laws, our society has recognized that spouses have the right to
seek dissolution of the marriage where relations between them have irrevocably
broken down.  The recognition that a marriage may be dissolved is reflected in
the long history of divorce legislation.  Divorce without a special Act of
Parliament has been possible in England since the 1857 Matrimonial Causes
Act (U.K.), 20 & 21 Vict., c. 85.  In Canada, there was a divorce Act
as early as 1758 in Nova Scotia and later in other provinces; the first federal
divorce Act was the Divorce Act, S.C. 1967‑68, c.  24, later
R.S.C. 1970, c. D‑8.  See ""Competence and Compellability"", supra,
at p. 6, and more generally Alastair Bissett‑Johnson and David C. Day, The
New Divorce Law (1986).

 

                   Modern divorce Acts
explicitly recognize that marriage is a partnership between equally free
individuals, as this excerpt from the preamble to the Family Law Act, 1986,
S.O. 1986, c. 4, illustrates:

 

Whereas
it is desirable to encourage and strengthen the role of the family; and whereas
for that purpose it is necessary to recognize the equal position of spouses as
individuals within marriage and to recognize marriage as a form of partnership;
and whereas in support of such recognition it is necessary to provide in law
for the orderly and equitable settlement of the affairs of the spouses upon the
breakdown of the partnership ....

 

                   (3)  Conclusion

 

                   The Charter 
has played and will continue to play a central role in defining the legal and
social fabric of this country.  As the Charter  is the supreme law of
Canada, any legislation or government action or law inconsistent with it is, to
the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect.  But the Charter 
will also be influential even in the absence of legislation or government
action.  In RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573,
McIntyre J. noted at p. 603 that the question of the application of the Charter 
to private litigation,

 

...
is a distinct issue from the question whether the judiciary ought to apply and
develop the principles of the common law in a manner consistent with the
fundamental values enshrined in the Constitution.  The answer to this question
must be in the affirmative.  In this sense, then, the Charter  is far
from irrelevant to private litigants whose disputes fall to be decided at
common law.

 

This passage was cited with approval
by L'Heureux-Dubé J., speaking for the Court in Cloutier v. Langlois,
[1990] 1 S.C.R. 158, at p. 184.    

 

                   Where the
principles underlying a common law rule are out of step with the values
enshrined in the Charter , the courts should scrutinize the rule
closely.  If it is possible to change the common law rule so as to make it
consistent with Charter  values, without upsetting the proper balance
between judicial and legislative action that I have referred to above, then the
rule ought to be changed.  The common law rule making an irreconcilably
separated spouse an incompetent witness for the prosecution against the other
spouse is inconsistent with the values in the Charter .  Subject to
consideration of the limits on the judicial role, the rule ought therefore to
be changed.   Society can have no interest in preserving marital harmony where
spouses are irreconcilably separated because there is no marital harmony to be
preserved.

 

                   The facts of this
case do not raise the issue of whether a spouse who is a competent witness for
the prosecution will also be compellable.  That question is for another day. 
However, were it necessary to decide this question, the possibility that a
competent spouse would be found also to be compellable is a real one, in light
of the reasons in R. v. McGinty (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 36 (Y.T.C.A.), R.
v. Marchand, supra, R. v. Czipps, supra, and R. v. Lonsdale
(1973), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 201 (Alta. S.C., App. Div.), although I would note that
in the U.S., a spouse is a competent but not a compellable witness for the
prosecution: Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40 (1980).

 

                   Making a separated
spouse a competent witness for the prosecution may ultimately mean that an
irreconcilably separated spouse is also compellable at the instance of the
prosecution.  However, I do not think that should affect the result in this
case.  I return to the idea of human dignity.  The dignity of the person arises
not only from the exercise of rights such as the freedom to choose, but also,
and just as importantly, from the assumption of the responsibilities that
naturally flow from participation in the life of the community.  At the level
of principle, it is just as much a denial of the dignity of an irreconcilably
separated spouse to exempt the spouse from the responsibility to testify
because of his or her status as it is a denial of the spouse's dignity to deny
his or her capacity to testify.  This is all the more true where historically
it has been women who have been unable to testify.

 

                   Concerns were
raised before us that making an irreconcilably separated spouse a competent
witness would increase the risk of violence to women.  Violence against women
is a very grave problem in our society, and any possibility of an increase in
the risk of violence must be taken most seriously.  But I find it difficult to
accept that the proper response to the threat of violence is to limit the
capacity of women in the hope that preventing women from testifying will
decrease the risk of violence against them.  If our expectations for a society
founded on respect for the dignity of the human person are to have meaning, we
must encourage and protect everyone in the exercise of their rights and
responsibilities as equal members of our society.  Furthermore, if a competent
spouse is also compellable, I would note that McLachlin J.A. (as she then was)
suggested in McGinty, supra, at p. 60, that making a spouse
compellable may in fact reduce the risk of violence by giving the spouse no
choice but to testify.  The same argument was made by the Evidence Project of
the Law Reform Commission of Canada in their study paper ""Competence and
Compellability"", supra, at pp. 6-7.

 

                   Moreover, if I were
to accept the argument that a separated spouse ought not to be competent to
testify because of the possibility of violence, I cannot see how I could resist
the argument that the same principle should be applied to divorced spouses. 
The difference between irreconcilable separation and divorce may have
significance de jure, but it has no significance de facto: 
irreconcilable separation is tantamount to divorce.  The conclusion that a
divorced spouse should not be a competent witness because of his or her former
marital status is contrary to common sense, and has been rejected in a number
of cases, including R. v. Bailey, R. v. Marchand and R. v.
Algar, supra.  However, I would repeat that the question of compellability
is not raised on this appeal.

 

C.  Should the Common Law
Rule Be Changed?

 

                   Absent
parliamentary intervention, I would conclude that changing the common law rule
to make spouses who are irreconcilably separated competent witnesses for the
prosecution would be appropriate.  Although the principles upon which this
change is based would appear to favour abolishing the rule entirely and making
all spouses competent witnesses under all circumstances, policy considerations
and uncertainty as to the consequences of such a change suggest that a more
cautious approach is appropriate.  The parties before us did not argue for such
a change, and in my opinion a far-reaching change of this kind is best left to
the legislature.  However, expanding the exceptions to the common law rule to
include irreconcilably separated spouses is precisely the kind of incremental
change which the courts can and should make.  The courts are the custodians of
the common law, and it is their duty to see that the common law reflects the
emerging needs and values of our society.

 

                   In argument before
us, the appellant contended, following the dissenting reasons of Carthy J.A. in
the Court of Appeal below, that the pattern of legislation in the Canada
Evidence Act  shows a parliamentary intention to retain the common law rule
as it presently stands.  The appellant also argued that there would be
difficulties in implementing the proposed new exception to the common law
rule.  I propose to deal with these arguments briefly.

 

                   (1)  Pattern
of Legislation

 

                   As I understand it,
the argument is that the various amendments which have been made to s. 4  of the
Canada Evidence Act  since 1906 indicate that Parliament has turned its
mind to the common law rule making a spouse an incompetent witness, and that
the rule has therefore been effectively ratified.  With respect, I must disagree. 
I do not propose to recount the history of the amendments to the Canada
Evidence Act  in detail but prefer to adopt the following excerpt from the
reasons of Blair J.A. in the Court of Appeal (at pp. 358-59):

 

                   With
respect, I cannot agree with my brother Carthy that the amendments made to the
Act since 1906 were enacted after careful scrutiny by Parliament acting with
full knowledge of the common law rule and its exceptions....  

 

...
The amendments were not made as parts of a comprehensive revision of the Act
and the common law rule and its exceptions such as that recommended by the law
reform reports referred to above.  The amendments, on the contrary, were
peripheral and largely consequential to amendments to the Code.  They
were made without any recorded consideration of the scope of the common law
rule and the issues raised in this case.  It is unrealistic to suggest that,
when making these amendments, Parliament directed its mind to all the
ramifications of the common law rule and its exceptions.  The most that can be
deduced from any of the amendments made to the Act is that Parliament was not
presented with any other proposals for change at the time they were passed.

 

                   (2)  Difficulties
of Implementation

 

                   The appellant
argued before us that determining if there is a reasonable possibility of
reconciliation between spouses will be a difficult task for the courts.  Since
the determination is necessarily entirely subjective, it will be the spouse
offered as a witness by the prosecution who will effectively determine if there
is in fact a reasonable possibility of reconciliation.

 

                   I must reject this
argument out of hand.  Courts are daily called upon to make subjective
determinations such as the existence of a reasonable possibility of
reconciliation.  To take one example, under s. 10 of the Divorce Act, R.S.C.,
1985, (2nd Supp.), c. 3, a court is required to ""satisfy itself that there
is no possibility of the reconciliation of the spouses, unless the
circumstances of the case are of such a nature that it would clearly not be
appropriate to do so"".  Our legal system turns on the ability of judges to
make such subjective determinations, and I have every confidence in the ability
of trial judges to make them.

 

D.  Conclusion

 

                   I would conclude
that in appropriate cases, judges can and should change the common law.  This
is such a case.  The common law should be the servant of society.  While there
are changes to the common law that are best left to the legislature, the change
made by the Court of Appeal in the present case to the rule that a spouse is an
incompetent witness for the prosecution is not an example of such a change.

 

E.  Disposition

 

                   For the foregoing
reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

                   Appellant was
convicted of second‑degree murder and his appeal to the Court of Appeal
was dismissed.  All the evidence against the appellant was of a circumstantial
nature.  The police had arranged for a friend to visit the appellant, while the
appellant was in custody, and provided the friend with a body pack recording
device.  A tape recording of the conversation, which established that the
appellant knew of the time of the victim's death, was admitted into evidence. 
During the conversation, the friend encouraged the appellant to ignore his
lawyer's advice that he remain silent and elicited information.  At issue was
whether the authorities obtained evidence of the appellant's conversation with
the informer in a manner that violated the appellant's right to silence,
including his right to choose whether or not to speak to the authorities.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
allowed.

 

                   The right to
silence is triggered when the accused is subjected to the coercive powers of
the state through his or her detention.  This right protects against the use of
state power to subvert the right of an accused to choose whether or not to
speak to the authorities.  Where the informer who allegedly acted to subvert
the right to silence of the accused is not obviously a state agent, the
analysis must focus on both the relationship between the informer and the state
and the relationship between the informer and the accused.  The right to
silence will only be infringed where the informer was acting as an agent of the
state at the time the accused made the statement and where it was the informer
who caused the accused to make the statement.  Accordingly, two distinct
inquiries are required.  First, as a threshold question, was the evidence
obtained by an agent of the state?  Second, was the evidence elicited?  The
right to silence in s. 7  will be violated only if both questions are
answered in the affirmative.

 

                   In answering the
threshold question of whether the evidence was obtained by an agent of the
state, one should remember that the purpose of the right to silence is to limit
the coercive power of the state.  If the person to whom the impugned remarks
are made is not an agent of the state, there will be no violation of the right
to silence.  The test for determining whether an informer is a state agent for
the purposes of the right to silence is a simple one:  would the exchange
between the accused and the informer have taken place, in the form and manner
in which it did take place, but for the intervention of the state or its
agents?

 

                   Only if the answer
to this question is in the negative will it be necessary to go on to consider
whether the evidence in question was elicited by the informer.  There will be
no violation of the right to silence if the suspect freely decides to provide
the information;  for there to be a violation, the information must be actively
elicited by the state agent.  In deciding whether the information was elicited,
two sets of factors should be considered to determine whether, considering all
the circumstances, there is a causal link between the conduct of the state
agent and the making of the statement by the accused.

 

                   The first set of
factors concerns the nature of the exchange between the accused and the state
agent.  Looking at the conversation as a whole, did the informer conduct his or
her part of the conversation as the accused would ordinarily have expected, or
was the conversation the functional equivalent of an interrogation?  The second
set of factors concerns the nature of the relationship between the state agent
and the accused:  did the state agent exploit any special characteristics of
the relationship to extract a statement? 

 

                   The authorities may
not take the benefit of the actions of their agent who exceeds his or her
instructions.  To hold otherwise would be to ignore the fact that the primary
emphasis of the right to silence in s. 7  is on the use of the coercive
power of the state against the suspect.  The authorities ought not to be able
to shield themselves behind the subtleties of their relationship with the
informer.

 

                   Applying the above
principles to the facts of this case, it is clear that the informer was an
agent of the state for the purposes of the right to silence in s. 7 .  The
conversation here would not have occurred or would have been materially
different but for the authorities' intervention.  Furthermore, the impugned
statement was elicited.  Parts of the conversation were functionally the
equivalent of an interrogation, and the appellant's trust in the informer as a
friend was used to undermine the appellant's confidence in his lawyer's advice
to remain silent and to create a mental state in which the appellant was more
likely to talk.  That the police did not instruct the informer to elicit a
statement from Broyles was irrelevant. 

 

                   The actions of the
police were not expressly or impliedly provided for by statute or the result of
a common law rule and therefore cannot be justified under s. 1  since they
were not ""prescribed by law"".  The admission of the evidence would
bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  Considering the three sets
of factors from Collins in turn, evidence obtained by conscripting the
accused against himself or herself will generally render the trial unfair and
the existence of other admissible evidence also tending to incriminate the
accused will not make the trial fair.  Self‑incriminatory evidence
strikes at one of the fundamental tenets of a fair trial, the right against
self‑incrimination, and the unfairness of the trial will be only
increased if the conviction depends on the self-incriminatory evidence.  

                   The violation of
the appellant's right to silence was sufficiently serious to operate in favour
of excluding the evidence.  The informer systematically undermined the
appellant's confidence in his counsel.  Moreover, where the fairness of the
trial has been affected by the admission of tainted evidence, good faith on the
part of the police cannot justify admitting the evidence.

 

                   The fact that an
offence is serious can provide no justification for the admission of the
evidence where the fairness of the trial has been affected.  This is all the
more so where the impugned evidence is not the only evidence incriminating the
accused.

 

                   This was not an
appropriate case to exercise the power granted by s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  to dismiss the appeal where no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred.  This section cannot be invoked if there
is any possibility that a trial judge would have a reasonable doubt on the
admissible evidence.  Given the importance of the evidence that resulted from
the informer's conversation with the appellant, it is possible that a trier of
fact would have a reasonable doubt as to the appellant's guilt if the evidence
in question were removed from consideration.

J. -- This appeal raises

police, who made arrangements for the visit including providing the friend with
a body pack recording device.

 

I. Facts

 

                   The appellant,
Emerson Raymond Broyles was sixteen years old at the time of the alleged murder
of his grandmother.  He had been living with his mother until she threw him out
of the house in January or February of 1984.  Broyles then lived with a number
of people, including his grandmother, Lorraine Briggs.  Briggs had a one
bedroom basement suite in a house owned by an elderly man.  Briggs slept in a
camperized van which she parked in the back of the house, and which she drove
to work.  When Broyles stayed with her, he slept in an upstairs bedroom. 
Briggs worked as a cook at the Edmonton Journal Cafeteria.  She started work at
six in the morning, and was never late.

 

                   On June 26, 1984,
Briggs did not show up for work.  Repeated phone calls to her home by her
supervisor went unanswered.  On July 3, Briggs' body was found under the
stairwell in her home, wrapped in green plastic garbage bags.  The body had
begun to decompose.  The cause of death was asphyxia resulting from
strangulation; two coils of thick rope were still wrapped tightly around her
neck when she was found.  The body was dressed in a long sleeved sweater, a
camisole and a nightie with a bra loosely arranged on the body but not in
place.  The nightie had been pulled up and the thighs and genital area exposed
but it was impossible to say if Briggs had been sexually molested.  A palm
print was found on one of the garbage bags which was positively identified as
being that of the accused Broyles.  In the expert opinion of an R.C.M.P. laser
expert, the print was ""most likely placed on the bag at a time when there
was an item in the bag"".  On July 4, Broyles was charged with two counts
of forgery.  On July 6, he was charged with murder.  

 

                   The only evidence
implicating Broyles in the murder was circumstantial.  Broyles was seen driving
his grandmother's van at seven or seven thirty on the morning of her
disappearance.  He drove the van until his arrest on July 3.  Broyles made
numerous inconsistent statements about the events surrounding his grandmother's
disappearance.  Of particular importance on this appeal are statements made by
Broyles to Todd Ritter.  Ritter was Broyles' friend.  He was asked by the
police to visit Broyles wearing a body pack recording device.  Although Broyles
did not admit to killing his grandmother to Ritter, he did admit that he knew
she was dead the day she went missing.  Broyles added, ""[b]ut the cops
don't know that I knew she was downstairs.  Only my [lawyer] knows that.  And
now you do"".  Broyles was convicted at trial before a judge and jury of
second degree murder.  He was given the minimum sentence of life in prison
without eligibility for parole for ten years.

 

                   Broyles was advised
of his right to counsel when he was first arrested for fraud on July 3.  At the
station, Broyles asked to call a lawyer.  He was given a telephone and a
telephone book, and left alone to make a telephone call.  Broyles was seen to
punch numbers into the phone, but he did not appear to be talking.  Broyles was
then questioned by Detective Anderson.  He was told that he was not obliged to
say anything unless he wished to do so, but that anything he said might be
given in evidence.  The interview lasted from 8:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. on July 3. 
Detective Anderson identified himself as being from the Homicide Branch of the
Edmonton City Police.  He did not tell Broyles that he was a suspect in the
disappearance of the deceased Briggs.  The interview was brought to an abrupt
end when Anderson was called out of the room to be informed that Briggs' body
had been discovered.  

 

                   Anderson began a
second interview of Broyles at 11 p.m. on the same day.  Anderson testified
that, at the beginning of the second interview, Broyles was not a suspect in a
homicide.  Anderson added that at that time the police were not even sure that
what they had was a homicide.  Anderson brought the interview to an end at
11:30 p.m. because he thought he would get nothing new from Broyles.  Anderson
then processed the paper work for the forgery charges.  However, Broyles was
not released because the ""investigation of the `suspicious death' was not
concluded so they kept him in the holding area in case they wanted to talk to
him again ...."" 

 

                   Detective Stewart
saw the body of the deceased that same night at 10:25 p.m.  He testified that
he suspected that it was an unnatural death because of the way in which the
body was found wrapped in plastic bags and entwined in ropes.  He returned to
headquarters, where it was decided that he would interview Broyles.  Broyles
was questioned by Stewart beginning at two in the morning on the same night. 
He was again given the caution about not being required to say anything.  The
interview was tape‑recorded.  There was some question whether Broyles had
asked for a lawyer during this interview, but the trial judge ruled that the
relevant part of the tape was inaudible.  Stewart testified that neither before
nor after the interview was he prepared to charge Broyles with murder.  

 

                   Broyles was
questioned again shortly before three in the morning of the same night by a
Detective Peters.  He was given the caution once again.  Peters had viewed the
body between 10:30 p.m. and 1:10 a.m. of the same night.  He suspected foul
play.  He suspected Broyles but did not have the basis to charge him.  The
interview ended at 3:39 a.m. on July 4.  On July 6, Broyles was charged with
murder.

III. The Courts Below

 

A. Alberta Court of Queen's Bench

 

                   Foster J. held a voir
dire on the voluntariness of the statements made by Broyles to Detectives
Anderson, Stewart and Peters, and to Todd Ritter.  The trial judge found that
the statements to the detectives were made to persons in authority and were
voluntary according to the tests in Ibrahim v. The King, [1914]
A.C. 599 (P.C.), and Rothman v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640.  The
trial judge also rejected the argument of defence counsel that the Charter 
cautions given to the accused were only in respect of the first charges for
fraud, while the later interviews related to a suspicion of murder:

 

The
accused also argues that while he may have been cautioned, the cautions were
with regard to a charge of fraud and that the interviews instead related to a
suspicion of murder.  This is not a case where an accused was arrested on one
charge and then questioned on an unrelated matter.  Nor was there any lack of
bona fides in the fraud or forgery charges being laid.  Nor indeed were these
charges insignificant.  It was at all times clear in the accused's mind what
incidents he was being questioned about, namely the disappearance of his
grandmother, his possession of her van, and her cheques.  As soon as the
investigation reached the stage where it was possible, the murder charge was
added to the forgery charges.  These matters were all interrelated and I do not
see any misleading or prejudice to the accused in connection with the caution. 

 

                   There was some
question whether Broyles had asked for a lawyer during the interview with
Detective Stewart.  The trial judge ruled that portion of the tape inaudible,
and accepted Detective Stewart's testimony that Broyles had not asked to call
his lawyer.  The trial judge also ruled that even if there were infringements
of Broyles' Charter  rights, the admission of the statements would not
bring the administration of justice into disrepute, and that consequently the
statements would have been admissible in any case.

 

                   The trial judge
rejected the contention of defence counsel that the Remand Centre had a duty
not to allow Ritter to see the accused where Ritter's purpose was to allow the
police to monitor a conversation between himself and the accused.  The trial
judge held that no s. 7  rights were involved:

 

[Defence
counsel argues] [t]hat the duty [of the Remand Centre] included a duty not to
allow Ritter in to see the accused where Ritter's purpose was to allow the
police to surreptitiously monitor a conversation between Ritter and the
accused.  I do not accept this argument.  I find no such duty on the Remand
Centre and I do not see how these circumstances can in any way be construed to
be a breach of Section 7  of the Charter .  There is no violation of the
accused's right to security of the person.  The Ritter statement is accordingly
admissible in evidence.

 

B. Alberta Court of Appeal
(1987), 82 A.R. 238

 

                   The Alberta Court
of Appeal dismissed Broyle's appeal.  Writing for the Court, Stevenson J.A. (as
he then was) rejected the s. 7  argument summarily.  He found that s. 7  did not
prohibit the conduct complained of at p. 240:

 

The
second ground [of appeal] was an assertion that the officers of the Remand
Centre were under a duty imposed by s. 7  of the Charter  not to permit
access to the accused by anyone whose object was to obtain any admission
against his interest.  We were not pointed to anything in the section that
would justify that conclusion. 

 

                   Stevenson J.A.
dealt at greater length with the issue of the rights of the accused under s.
10 (b) of the Charter .  He considered, but ultimately rejected,
the argument of defence counsel that a fresh duty to give s. 10 (b)
advice arose when the focus of the police investigation changed from fraud to
murder.  Stevenson J.A. noted that the accused was fully aware of his Charter 
rights from the caution given to him on his initial arrest, and that he had
been given an opportunity to contact his counsel.  He rejected the notion that
an accused should again be informed of a right which he already understands: 
""There is no reality to any suggestion that the accused should be again
informed of a right which he understood, in relation to circumstances which he
also understood"".  In addition, the Court of Appeal declined to interfere
with the ruling of Foster J. that Broyles had not asked to call his lawyer
during the interview with Detective Stewart.  

 

IV. Issues

 

                   The parties raise
the following issues:

 

1.Was
the evidence of the conversation between the appellant and Ritter obtained in a
manner which infringed s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If
the answer to the first question is yes, should the evidence be excluded under
s. 24(2)  of the Charter ?

 

3.Is
it appropriate to invoke the curative proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code ?

 

                   The issue of a
possible violation of s. 10 (b) of the Charter  was abandoned on
appeal by the appellant.

 

V. Analysis

 

A. Section 7 of the Charter

 

                   In R. v. Hebert,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, this Court found that s. 7  of the Charter  includes
a right to silence which includes the right to choose whether or not to make a
statement to the authorities.  In Hebert, Justice McLachlin described
the right as follows, at p. 186:

 

                   The
essence of the right to silence is that the suspect be given a choice; the
right is quite simply the freedom to choose ‑‑ the freedom to speak
to the authorities on the one hand, and the freedom to refuse to make a
statement to them on the other.

 

The question before us here is
therefore:  did the authorities obtain evidence of the appellant's conversation
with Ritter in a manner that violated the appellant's right to silence,
including his right to choose whether or not to speak to the authorities?

 

                   (1) R. v.
Hebert

 

                   At issue in Hebert,
supra, was the admissibility of evidence obtained by an undercover
police officer posing as a fellow cell mate of the appellant Hebert.  McLachlin
J. held that, where an undercover police officer does more than passively
observe the suspect, but goes so far as to elicit information from him or her,
s. 7  of the Charter  will be infringed.  On the facts of Hebert,
it was evident that the authorities had used a trick to undercut Hebert's
clearly asserted choice to remain silent.

 

                   It is clear from Hebert
that the right to silence is triggered when the accused is subjected to the
coercive powers of the state through his or her detention.  The question of
what right to silence, if any, remains after a detainee is released is a
question not raised by the facts of this case.

 

                   This case requires
this Court to answer two questions which were not raised in Hebert.  In Hebert
it was indisputable that the undercover officer was an agent of the state.  In
this case, Ritter was not a police officer.  He was a friend of the appellant
who was asked to visit the accused by the authorities, and whose visit was
facilitated by them.  We must therefore decide if Ritter was an agent of the
state for the purposes of s. 7 .  Moreover, it is not self‑evident, in
light of Hebert, whether the manner in which Ritter conducted his
conversation with the appellant did or did not infringe the appellant's s. 7 
rights.  On the facts of Hebert, it was unnecessary to define
""elicitation"" precisely, whereas such a definition is required to
reach a conclusion in this case.

 

                   (2) The Two‑Part
Test for the Right to Silence in s. 7 

 

                   It is clear from Hebert,
supra, that the purpose of the right to silence is to prevent the use of
state power to subvert the right of an accused to choose whether or not to
speak to the authorities. Where the informer who allegedly acted to subvert the
right to silence of the accused is not obviously a state agent, the analysis
will necessarily focus not only on the relationship between the informer and
the accused, but also on the relationship between the informer and the state.
The right to silence will only be infringed where it was the informer who
caused the accused to make the statement, and where the informer was acting as
an agent of the state at the time the accused made the statement. Accordingly,
two distinct inquiries are required. First, as a threshold question, was the
evidence obtained by an agent of the state? Second, was the evidence elicited?
Only if the answer to both questions is in the affirmative will there be a
violation of the right to silence in s. 7 .

 

                   (a) The
Threshold Question

 

                   In every case where
the right to silence is raised, the threshold question will be:  was the person
who allegedly subverted the right to silence an agent of the state?  In
answering this question one should remember that the purpose of the right to
silence is to limit the use of the coercive power of the state to force an
individual to incriminate himself or herself; it is not to prevent individuals
from incriminating themselves per se.  Accordingly, if the person to
whom the impugned remarks is made is not an agent of the state, there will be
no violation of the right to silence.

 

                   In some cases, it
will be clear that the person to whom the statements were made was an agent of
the state.  For example, if the statements were made to a police officer or to
a prison official, whether in uniform or in plainclothes, there could be no question
that the statements were made to an agent of the state.  In other cases, it
will be less clear.  Where the statements are made to an informer, as in the
case at bar, it may be arguable whether or not the coercive power of the state
was brought to bear on the suspect in obtaining the statement from him or her.

 

                   In determining
whether or not the informer is a state agent, it is appropriate to focus on the
effect of the relationship between the informer and the authorities on the
particular exchange or contact with the accused.  A relationship between the
informer and the state is relevant for the purposes of s. 7  only if it affects
the circumstances surrounding the making of the impugned statement.  A
relationship between the informer and the authorities which develops after the
statement is made, or which in no way affects the exchange between the informer
and the accused, will not make the informer a state agent for the purposes of
the exchange in question.  Only if the relationship between the informer and
the state is such that the exchange between the informer and the accused is
materially different from what it would have been had there been no such
relationship should the informer be considered a state agent for the purposes
of the exchange.  I would accordingly adopt the following simple test:  would
the exchange between the accused and the informer have taken place, in the form
and manner in which it did take place, but for the intervention of the state or
its agents?

 

                   If this test is
applied to a conversation between a police officer and a suspect in custody, it
is clear that the conversation would not have taken place but for the
intervention of the officer.  If it is applied to a conversation with a cell
mate who has no contact with the authorities until after the conversation is
concluded, it is equally clear that the actions of the authorities had no
effect on the conversation, and that there would be no violation of the s. 7 
right to silence.  If, however, the cell mate spoke with the authorities before
the conversation took place, then the question will be whether the conversation
would have occurred or would have taken the same course had the cell mate had
no contact with the authorities.

 

                   I would add that
there may be circumstances in which the authorities encourage informers to
elicit statements without there being a pre-existing relationship between the
authorities and individual informers.  For example, the authorities may provide
an incentive for the elicitation of incriminating statements by making it known
that they will pay for such information or that they will charge the informer
with a less serious offence.  The question in such cases will be the same: 
would the exchange between the informer and the accused have taken place but for
the inducements of the authorities?

 

                   (b) Elicitation

 

                   Even if the
evidence in question was acquired by an agent of the state, it will only have
been acquired in violation of s. 7  if the manner in which it was acquired
infringed the suspect's right to choose to remain silent.  In general, there
will be no violation of the suspect's right to silence if the suspect
volunteers the information, knowing he or she is talking to an agent of the
state.  In the words of McLachlin J. in Hebert, supra, at p. 184:

 

If
the police are not posing as undercover officers and the accused chooses to
volunteer information, there will be no violation of the Charter . 
Police persuasion, short of denying the suspect the right to choose or
depriving him of an operating mind, does not breach the right to silence.

 

                   In Hebert, supra,
my colleague McLachlin J., left open the possibility that there will be cases
amounting to more than permissible police persuasion but less than deprivation
of an operating mind which will infringe the suspect's right to choose to
remain silent.  I would agree that there may well be such cases, but it is
unnecessary to decide that question in this case.

 

                   If, on the other
hand, the suspect is ignorant of the fact that he is talking to an agent of the
state, whether a suborned informer or an undercover police officer, somewhat
different considerations will apply.  It is clear from the majority reasons in Hebert,
supra, that statements volunteered by the suspect to the agent of the
state will not infringe the suspect's right to silence.  There will be a violation
of the s. 7  right to silence only if the statement is elicited by the agent of
the state.  As McLachlin J. expressed it in Hebert, supra, at p.
184, the state agent must ""actively elicit"" the information or
statement.  The focus will be on what constitutes ""elicitation"" in
the context of the right to silence.     

 

                   In developing a
definition of elicitation, I have found it unnecessary to refer at length to
the U.S. jurisprudence dealing with the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the U.S.
Constitution.  In broad terms, the concern with Sixth Amendment right to
counsel is, to quote the judgment of Brennan J. in Maine v. Moulton, 474
U.S. 159 (1985), at p. 176, to protect the right of an accused ""to rely on
counsel as a `medium' between him and the State,"" and not specifically to
protect the right of an accused to choose whether or not to make a statement. 
Although the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is similar in
form to the right to silence in s. 7  of the Charter , the Supreme Court
of the United States has recently held, in Illinois v. Perkins, 110
S.Ct. 2394 (1990), that Fifth Amendment rights do not prohibit surreptitious
jail house conversations of the kind which this Court found to violate s. 7  in Hebert. 
This is not to say that the U.S. jurisprudence will not be useful in resolving
particular problems that may arise in developing the contours of the right to
silence as McLachlin J. did in Hebert.  In general, however, Canadian
courts should not be hesitant to develop a uniquely Canadian approach to the
right to silence, in keeping with the overall goals of the Charter .

 

                   In my view, it is
difficult to give a short and precise meaning of elicitation but rather one
should look to a series of factors to decide the issue.  These factors test the
relationship between the state agent and the accused so as to answer this
question:  considering all the circumstances of the exchange between the
accused and the state agent, is there a causal link between the conduct of the
state agent and the making of the statement by the accused?  For convenience, I
arrange these factors into two groups.  This list of factors is not exhaustive,
nor will the answer to any one question necessarily be dispositive.

 

                   The first set of
factors concerns the nature of the exchange between the accused and the state
agent. Did the state agent actively seek out information such that the exchange
could be characterized as akin to an interrogation, or did he or she conduct his
or her part of the conversation as someone in the role the accused believed the
informer to be playing would ordinarily have done?  The focus should not be on
the form of the conversation, but rather on whether the relevant parts of the
conversation were the functional equivalent of an interrogation.

 

                   The second set of
factors concerns the nature of the relationship between the state agent and the
accused.  Did the state agent exploit any special characteristics of the
relationship to extract the statement?  Was there a relationship of trust
between the state agent and the accused?  Was the accused obligated or
vulnerable to the state agent? Did the state agent manipulate the accused to
bring about a mental state in which the accused was more likely to talk?

 

                   In considering
whether the statement in question was elicited, evidence of the instructions
given to the state agent for the conduct of the conversation may be important. 
As McLachlin J. noted in Hebert, supra, evidence that the agent
was instructed not to initiate the conversation nor to ask leading questions
will tend to refute the allegation that the resulting statement was obtained in
violation of s. 7 .  I would add, however, that in my opinion evidence that the
state agent was instructed not to elicit information will not end the inquiry. 
The authorities may not take the benefit of the actions of their agent which
exceed his or her instructions.  To hold otherwise would be to ignore the fact
that the primary emphasis of the right to silence in s. 7  is on the use of the
coercive power of the state against the suspect.  The authorities ought not to
be able to shield themselves behind the subtleties of their relationship with
the informer.  It is the authorities who are in a position to control the actions
of their informer; if they fail to do so, they ought not to benefit from that
failure at the expense of the accused.  See United States v. Henry, 447
U.S. 264 (1980), at pp. 271‑72.

 

                   (c) Application
to the Facts of This Case

 

                   There is no
question that Ritter was an agent of the state during his conversation with the
appellant.  It is clear on the evidence that the meeting was set up and
facilitated by the police.  Ritter was able to have an ""open visit""
with the appellant, which made possible a free‑ranging conversation, only
because of the intervention of the police.  In fact, Ritter went so far as to
admit that he was not frightened during his visit with the appellant
""because it had been set up by the police"".  Moreover, in their
discussions with Ritter, the authorities effectively instructed him to elicit
information about the death of Briggs, as the following excerpt from Ritter's
cross‑examination illustrates:

 

Q.So
Detective Anderson phoned you, and he said what?

 

A.Well,
he said ‑‑‑ I asked him how the investigation was going.  He
said they were having a bit of problems [sic].  James wasn't saying
anything.  He asked me if I would be interested in wearing a body pack and
talking to James.  If he would set up the meeting, would I talk to James.

 

                                                                    ...

 

Q.It
became clear to you that Detective Anderson required your assistance because
James was not talking to the police about this?

 

A.Yeah,
I suppose.

 

                                                                    ...

 

Q....
Why did you agree to do it?

 

A.Because
I thought it was the right thing to do.

 

Q.Why
did you think it was the right thing to do?

 

A.Well,
the police were having trouble, and I thought if I could help out, why
shouldn't I.

 

                                                                    ...

 

Q.What
were you going to talk to James about?

 

A.They
wanted to know if I could find out whether he killed her or not.

 

Q.And
this was all on the phone with Detective Anderson the first time?

 

A.Yes.

 

If the authorities had not intervened,
the conversation between Ritter and the appellant would either not have
occurred at all, or else would have taken a materially different course.  I
would therefore conclude that for the purposes of the right to silence in s. 7 
of the Charter , Ritter was an agent of the state.  This issue was also
effectively conceded by the respondent. 

 

                   But did Ritter
elicit the statements in question from the appellant?  Turning to the first set
of factors relating to the nature of the conversation, did Ritter allow the
conversation to flow naturally, or did he direct the conversation to those
areas where he knew the police needed information?  Looking to the transcript
of the conversation between Ritter and the appellant, I find there is no question
that parts of the conversation were functionally the equivalent of an
interrogation, as the following excerpt illustrates:

 

JAMESLike
I, I already said stuff and whatnot.  There's really no more that I can say.

 

TODDYou
could admit to them that you killed her.

 

JAMESBut
I didn't.

 

TODDAre
you sure?

 

JAMESYeah.

 

TODDYou
weren't out on drugs or nothing.

 

JAMESNo.

 

TODDThat
you don't remember.  That you would have lost control.

 

JAMESNo.

 

In cross-examination, Ritter admitted
that his intention had been to elicit information about the killing from the
appellant:

 

Q.You
didn't think that he [i.e., the appellant] killed her, but you went in there to
elicit a statement to the effect that he had killed her?

 

A.Yes.

 

                   With respect to the
second group of factors concerning the nature of the relationship between
Ritter and the appellant, Ritter did exploit the special characteristics of his
relationship with the appellant to extract the statement. Ritter sought to
exploit the appellant's trust in him as a friend to undermine the appellant's
confidence in his lawyer's advice to remain silent and to create a mental state
in which the appellant was more likely to talk:

 

JAMESWell
like I talked to my lawyer and what not and he told me not to say anything to
anybody else.

 

TODDWhy?
What good is it gonna do you man?

 

JAMESHey
I don't know what he has planned to do and whatnot.

 

TODDWell
you better talk to him.  Cause sounds like he's trying to screw you around. 
That's what he's doing.  Well what good is it gonna do you to spend twenty five
years [sic] in jail for something you didn't do cause your lawyer tells
you not to say anything.

 

JAMESNo
like he, he has all the information and whatnot.  But he doesn't want me to
talking [sic] to the crown about it yet.  Not until we get up there in,
like the court room and whatnot.  And on the record.  

 

                                                                    ...

 

TODDWell
I don't see why he's [i.e., the appellant's lawyer] not doing anything then. 
But he's the one getting paid the bucks.

 

JAMESYeah. 
Plenty I think too.

 

TODDThat's
why he's not doing nothing.

 

JAMESLike
when my social worker ever comes down here and what not I'm gonna tell her that
bla, bla, bla, to get Pringle .. Instead of Hannington [sic].

 

TODDThat's
who you got now, Hannington [sic]...  I think Pringle's a much better
lawyer.

 

                   Ritter's ploy was
not only an obvious attempt to elicit a confession from the appellant, but it
also undermined the appellant's right to counsel.  In Hebert, supra,
McLachlin J.  recognized the close connection between the right to counsel and
the right to silence, at p. 176:

 

                   The
most important function of legal advice upon detention is to ensure that the
accused understands his rights, chief among which is his right to silence.  The
detained suspect, potentially at a disadvantage in relation to the informed and
sophisticated powers at the disposal of the state, is entitled to rectify the
disadvantage by speaking to legal counsel at the outset, so that he is aware of
his right not to speak to the police and obtains appropriate advice with
respect to the choice he faces.  Read together, ss. 7  and 10 (b) confirm
the right to silence in s. 7  and shed light on its nature.

 

The right to counsel would indeed be
meaningless if the authorities were entitled to undermine the confidence of the
accused in his counsel in order to extract a confession.  I note that the
relationship between the right to silence and against self‑incrimination
and the right to counsel was also recognized in Miranda v. Arizona, 384
U.S. 436 (1966).

 

                   That the police did
not instruct Ritter to elicit a statement from Broyles is irrelevant.  They
should not have the benefit of an informer who will elicit a statement without
being instructed to do so.

 

                   Considering all
these factors, I think it is clear that Ritter did elicit the statements from
the appellant.  Accordingly, I would conclude that the statements of the
appellant made during his conversation with Ritter were obtained in violation
of his right under s. 7  of the Charter  to choose to remain silent.

 

B. Justification Under s. 1

 

                   As in Hebert,
supra, the actions of the police were not expressly or impliedly
provided for by statute or the result of a common law rule.  Since they were not
""prescribed by law"", the actions of the police cannot be justified
under s. 1.

 

C. Section 24(2) of the Charter

 

                   Since the judgment
of Lamer J. (as he then was) in R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, the
question of whether the admission of the evidence would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute has been analyzed in terms of three
groups of factors. These three groups of factors were conveniently summarized
in R. v. Strachan, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 980, at p. 1006:

 

The
first group concerns the fairness of the trial. The nature of the evidence,
whether it is real evidence or self-incriminating evidence produced by the
accused, will be relevant to this determination. The second group relates to
the seriousness of the Charter  violation. Consideration will focus on
the relative seriousness of the violation, whether the violation was committed
in good faith or was of a merely technical nature or whether it was wilful,
deliberate and flagrant, whether the violation was motivated by circumstances
of urgency or necessity, and whether other investigatory techniques that would
not have infringed the Charter  were available. The final set of factors
relates to the disrepute that would arise from exclusion of the evidence.

 

This Court has often had occasion to consider
s. 24(2)  of the Charter . More recent cases include R. v. Ross,
[1989] 1 S.C.R. 3; R. v. Genest, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 59; R. v. Black,
[1989] 2 S.C.R. 138; R. v. Debot, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140; R. v. Duarte,
[1990] 1 S.C.R. 30; R. v. Brydges, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 190; Thomson
Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive
Trade Practices Commission), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425; R. v. Greffe,
[1990] 1 S.C.R. 755; R. v. Ladouceur, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1257; R. v.
Hebert, supra; R. v. Thompson, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1111; R. v.

Smith, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 714; R. v. Evans, [1991] 1 S.C.R 869; R.
v. Elshaw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 24.

 

                   I will consider the
three sets of factors in turn.

 

                   (1) Fairness of
the Trial

 

                   In general, the
admission of self‑incriminating obtained as a result of a breach of the Charter ,
unlike the admission of real evidence which would have existed regardless of
the breach, will make the trial unfair:  R. v. Collins, supra,
per Lamer J. (as he then was).  In Hebert, supra, McLachlin J.
held that self‑incriminating statements obtained in violation of the
suspect's right to remain silent should be excluded because their admission
would render the trial unfair.  McLachlin J.'s reasoning turned on both the
unfair trick practised by the police, and on the absence of other evidence
against the accused (at pp. 188-89):

 

I am
of the view that the evidence sought to be adduced in this case would render
the trial unfair.  I should not be taken as suggesting that violation of an
accused's right to silence under s. 7  automatically means that the evidence
must be excluded under s. 24(2) .  I would not wish to rule out the possibility
that there may be circumstances in which a statement might be received where
the suspect has not been accorded a full choice in the sense of having decided,
after full observance of all rights, to make a statement voluntarily.  But
where, as here, an accused is conscripted to give evidence against himself after
clearly electing not to do so by use of an unfair trick practised by the
authorities, and where the resultant statement is the only evidence against
him, one must surely conclude that reception of the evidence would render the
trial unfair.  The accused would be deprived of his presumption of innocence
and would be placed in the position of having to take the stand if he wished to
counter the damaging effect of the confession.  The accused's conviction if
obtained would rest almost entirely on his own evidence against himself,
obtained by a trick in violation of the Charter .  

 

                   In the present
case, the conversation between Ritter and the appellant is not the only piece
of evidence against the appellant.  The appellant was convicted at trial on the
basis of a circumstantial case, and there are a number of other pieces of
evidence which were introduced by the Crown to establish consciousness of guilt
by the appellant.  In my opinion, however, the fact that evidence is obtained
by conscripting the accused against himself or herself will generally be
sufficient to render the trial unfair.  The existence of other admissible
evidence also tending to incriminate the accused will not make the trial fair. 
Self‑incriminatory evidence renders a trial unfair because it
""strikes at one of the fundamental tenets of a fair trial, the right
against self‑incrimination"" (Collins, supra, per
Lamer J., at p. 284), not because of the effect of its admission on the outcome
of the trial.  However, if the impugned evidence is the only evidence tending
to incriminate the accused, the fact that the conviction of the accused depends
on self‑incriminatory evidence will increase the unfairness of the trial,
as McLachlin J. indicated in Hebert, supra.

 

                   I would therefore
conclude that the admission of the evidence would render the trial unfair.

 

                   (2) Seriousness
of the Violation

 

                   In the present
case, the violation of the appellant's right to silence was a serious one. 
Ritter systematically undermined the appellant's confidence in his counsel so
as to get him to talk in spite of the instructions of his lawyer to remain
silent.  The attack on his counsel together with what amounted to an
interrogation about the death of his grandmother were successful, and the
appellant made one very damaging admission.  In my opinion, the seriousness of
the violation operates in this case as a factor favouring exclusion of the
evidence.

 

                   The respondent
argued before us that the good faith of the police in sending Ritter in to talk
with the appellant was a factor tending to reduce the seriousness of the
violation.  With respect, I must disagree.  As I indicated in Elshaw, supra,
I agree with the reasons of Sopinka J. in Hebert, supra, that, at
least where the fairness of the trial has been affected by the admission of
tainted evidence, good faith on the part of the police cannot reduce the
seriousness of the violation.

 

                   (3) Effect of
Excluding the Evidence

 

                   The appellant was
charged with a very serious offence.  However, where the fairness of the trial
would be affected by the admission of the evidence, the mere fact that the
offence is a serious one provides no justification for admitting the evidence. 
To adopt the words of Lamer J. (as he then was), in R. v. Brydges, supra,
at p. 211:  ""... this Court has repeatedly held that ... a serious offence
provides no justification for admitting the evidence where there has been a
serious Charter  violation and the admission of the evidence would affect
the fundamental fairness of the trial.""  I would also note that the fact
that the impugned evidence is not the only evidence incriminating the accused
further reduces the effect on the reputation of the administration of justice
of excluding the evidence.  Accordingly, I would conclude that exclusion of the
evidence would not significantly affect the repute of the administration of
justice.

 

                   The respondent
argued before us that because the accused declined to testify at trial, the
exclusion of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.  This argument is without merit.  The right of an accused not to
testify is a fundamental value of our criminal justice system, enshrined in s.
11 (c) of the Charter :

 

                   11. Any person charged with an offence
has the right 

 

                                                                    ...

 

(c)
not to be compelled to be a witness in proceedings against that person in
respect of the offence;

 

The right against self‑incrimination
was identified by Lamer J. in Collins, supra, as one of the
""fundamental tenets of a fair trial"" (at p. 284).  The failure of the
accused to testify cannot be a factor against the exclusion of the evidence.

 

                   (4) Conclusion
on s. 24(2) 

 

                   In my opinion, the
evidence should be excluded.  Because the evidence was obtained by conscripting
the accused against himself, its admission would render the trial unfair.  The
violation was a serious one and I am satisfied that the exclusion of the
evidence will not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  Having
considered the factors enumerated in Collins, supra, I am
satisfied that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute and thus the evidence must be excluded.

 

D. The Curative Proviso

 

                   In my opinion, this
is not an appropriate case to exercise the power granted to this Court by s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  to dismiss the appeal where no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred.  The appropriate standard for the
application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) is an onerous one.  I adopt the
approach of Sopinka J. in R v. P.L.S., [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909, at p. 919: 
s. 686(1) (b)(iii) cannot be invoked if there is ""any possibility
that a trial judge would have a reasonable doubt on the admissible
evidence"".  A similar approach to s. 686(1) (b)(iii) was adopted by
Spence J. in Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739, at p. 756, with
respect to a predecessor provision of the Code.

 

                   I
am of the opinion that this Court cannot place itself in the position of a jury
and weigh these various pieces of evidence.  If there is any possibility that
twelve reasonable men, properly charged, would have a reasonable doubt as to
the guilt of the accused, then this Court should not apply the provisions of s.
592(1)(b)(iii) to affirm a conviction.

 

                   Accordingly, the
question here is whether there is any possibility that the trier of fact would
have had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused had the impugned
evidence been removed from their consideration.  In argument, the respondent
maintained that there was overwhelming evidence of guilt in addition to the
impugned evidence, and that the fact that the appellant knew that his
grandmother was dead at the bottom of the stairs was inferrable from other
facts properly before the jury.  With respect, I am unable to agree.  The
evidence in question was an important element in the Crown's case at trial, and
was emphasized in the Crown prosecutor's charge to the jury.  The trial judge
went so far as to state in her charge to the jury that the appellant's
admission that he knew the victim was dead before the body was discovered was a
""rather important statement"".  The fact that the jury asked to listen
to the tape of the conversation between Ritter and the appellant again can only
mean that they too considered the evidence to be important.

 

                   Given the
importance of the evidence that resulted from Ritter's conversation with the
appellant, I must conclude that it is possible that a trier of fact would have
a reasonable doubt as to the appellant's guilt if the evidence in question were
removed from her or his consideration.  Accordingly, I would not apply s.
686(1) (b)(iii) to dismiss the appeal.

                   For the foregoing
reasons, I would allow the appeal and order a new trial.

                   This appeal, which
comes to us as of right, involves the issuance of a search warrant to a police
officer by a judge, pursuant to the provisions of the Narcotic Control Act,
R.S.C., 1985, c. N‑1, to search the appellant's dwelling house for
cocaine.  That is, a judge was satisfied, by information on oath, that there
were reasonable and probable grounds for believing that there was cocaine in
the appellant's dwelling house, and that the offence of possession of a
narcotic for the purpose of trafficking had been committed in the dwelling
house.  These grounds were based on information that the police received from a
reliable informant to the effect that the sale of narcotics was taking place in
the dwelling house and that the front door might be barricaded, from which the
police could infer that the occupant wished to have time to destroy any
evidence.  The legality of the warrant has not been challenged by the
appellant.

 

                   It was recognized
by this Court in R. v. Genest, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 59, at pp. 85‑86,
following Eccles v. Bourque, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 739, at pp. 746‑47,
that the police may enter a dwelling house without first announcing their
presence if it is necessary to do so to prevent the destruction of evidence. 
We are all of the opinion that, under all the circumstances of this case, the
police were entitled to enter the appellant's dwelling to execute their search
warrant in order to prevent the destruction of evidence.  Accordingly, the
appeal is dismissed.

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered orally by

 

                   The
Chief Justice ‑‑
This is a summary conviction proceeding.  The case concerns the withdrawal of
two informations by the Crown, subsequent to the accused pleading not guilty
but before any evidence was adduced against him, and the immediate issuance of
a new information in which both of the old charges were consolidated.  The
accused argues that the new information can be successfully met with a plea of autrefois
acquit, and the sole aspect of this special plea which is in issue is
whether the withdrawal of the informations can be characterized as in the
nature of an acquittal.

 

                   We are all of the
opinion that the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan did not err in holding that a
plea of autrefois acquit was not available to the accused on the facts
of this case.  The withdrawal flowed from a purely technical consideration, and
did not represent a decision on legal or factual grounds.  Moreover, to expose
the accused to a new information based upon the same events and offences
mentioned in the original informations would expose him to no prejudice. 
Finally, the withdrawal occurred at the very beginning of the trial, before any
evidence was adduced.  The appeal is dismissed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for
manitoba

 

    Criminal
law -- Criminal negligence causing death -- Comments by trial judge relating to
the relevance of consequences and intention -- Whether or not comments affected
outcome of trial -- Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34,
ss. 202(1), (2), 203, 237(2), (3) [R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
ss. 219(1) , (2) , 220 , 255(2) , (3) ].

 

    Appellant
was charged with criminal negligence causing death.  He had been thinking of
something else, ran a red light and a passenger in the car he hit died as a
result injuries suffered in the accident.  There was no evidence of any erratic
driving apart from driving through the red traffic light.  Appellant, although
legally impaired, showed little sign of impairment.  The trial judge found that
the Crown had failed to prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.  During the
course of his reasons the trial judge stated that neither the mens rea nor the
consequences of the manner of driving were material in making a decision as to
guilt or innocence.  An appeal was allowed by the Court of Appeal.  The sole
issue here was whether the trial judge's comments relating to the relevance of
consequences and intention affected the outcome.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should allowed.

 

    The
conclusion that there is a wanton or reckless disregard is to be drawn from the
conduct which falls below the applicable standard.  The conduct relied on here
was (a) the combination of drinking and driving, and (b) the breach of a
traffic light regulation.  The trial judge considered both and concluded that
the conduct was not a marked departure from the norm.  A conclusion that the
appellant had a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives and safety of others
could not therefore be drawn on either a subjective or objective basis.  The
unfortunate fact that a person was killed added nothing with respect to
appellant's conduct.  The negligence proved against him by evidence of his
drinking and driving and of his going through a red light was found not to be a
marked departure from the norm and the fatal collision added nothing to
appellant's conduct to bring it within the realm of a marked departure.  In
some circumstances, however, the actions of the accused and the consequences
flowing from them may be so interwoven that the consequences may be relevant in
characterizing the conduct of the accused.

 

    The
trial judge's finding of reasonable doubt could be supported on the
facts.  Although he made some general remarks that perhaps should not have
been made without elaboration, no error of law resulted.  The trial judge's
statements did not affect the outcome.

    The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

    Sopinka
J. --  This is an appeal as of right from the Manitoba Court of Appeal which
allowed an appeal from the judgment of Ferg J. acquitting the appellant of the
charge of criminal negligence causing death.  The sole issue in this appeal is
whether certain comments by Ferg J. relating to the relevance of
consequences and intention affected the outcome.

 

Facts

 

    The
following facts were found by the trial judge.

 

    At
approximately 5:06 p.m. on May 21, 1983, the appellant was driving his parents'
automobile westerly along Logan Avenue in the City of Winnipeg.  At the
intersection of Logan Avenue and Arlington Street he went through a red traffic
light and struck a northerly bound vehicle broadside.  The collision took place
in the northeast quadrant of the intersection.  A passenger in the north bound
vehicle died as a result of injuries received in the collision.  Apart from
driving through the red traffic light, there was no evidence of any erratic
driving.  He was driving within the speed limit.

 

    The
appellant had been drinking.  A blood alcohol reading taken approximately one
hour after the accident revealed that he had a blood alcohol level of 200
milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.  A police officer with 34
years' experience who observed the appellant and administered the breathalyser
test found no sign of gross impairment.  He conceded on cross-examination that
the appellant ""showed very little impairment at all"".   The trial
judge accepted the evidence of this witness.  A statement taken from the
appellant the day after the occurrence and tendered by the Crown disclosed that
the appellant admitted that he was thinking about something else and he went
through the red light.

 

Trial
Judgment

 

    The
trial judge reviewed the above facts and considered them in the light of the
Crown's argument that there was wanton and reckless disregard of the lives and
safety of others in the appellant's getting into his automobile in his impaired
condition and then driving through a red light.  Ferg J. remarked that
these factors were insufficient to establish the degree of negligence
required.  After reviewing the authorities he concluded that the Crown had
failed to prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.  He stated:

 

    Looking
at the circumstances in this case, looking at the facts, I cannot find that the
Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that this accused in his manner of
driving and in the circumstances and the facts as we have them, I cannot find
that he was guilty of blatant disregard for the lives and safety of others. 
Certainly, however, his driving was dangerous.

 

    During
the course of his reasons, Ferg J. made the following statement which was
the basis for the attack on his judgment both here and in the Court of Appeal:

 

    Consequences
of the manner of driving are not material in making a decision as to the guilt
or innocense [sic]; nor is mens rea, or the intention required to be
proved by the Crown.  It matters not what the man's intention was when he
entered the automobile to put it into use.  Nevertheless, of course, the Crown
must carry its burden, as always, of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the
offence.

 

Court of
Appeal (1985), 33 Man. R. (2d) 308

 

    The
Court of Appeal gave effect to two grounds of appeal which were based on the
passage in the reasons of the trial judge to which I have referred.  These
grounds were stated in the Notice of Appeal as follows:

 

2. THAT the learned Trial Judge erred in refusing to
consider the consequences of the manner of driving in arriving at a verdict;

 

3. THAT
the learned Trial Judge erred in disregarding the intention of the Respondent
at the time he entered his automobile prior to the collision; . . .

 

    In
connection with these grounds the respondent Crown advanced an argument that
self-induced drunkenness cannot be used as a defence and hence drunk driving
coupled with the creation of a risk must always result in a conviction
of criminal negligence.  O'Sullivan J.A., speaking for the Court, was of
the view that this proposition went too far.  Although a trial judge must take
alcohol consumption into account as one of the circumstances from which wanton
or reckless driving can be inferred, there was no presumption of law as
suggested by the Crown.  Furthermore, on the facts of this case there was
nothing to suggest that the trial judge had not considered the factor of
alcohol consumption.

 

    O'Sullivan J.A.
was, however, of the opinion that the trial judge had misdirected himself as to
the relevance of consequences and intention.  Since he could not say that this
misdirection did not affect the verdict, a new trial was directed.

 

Criminal
Negligence -- General

 

    In
approaching the critique of a trial judgment dealing with a charge of criminal
negligence, one can only have profound sympathy for the plight of the trial
judge.  This area of the law, both here and in other common law countries, has
proved to be one of the most difficult and uncertain in the whole of the
criminal field.  The sections of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, now R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , under consideration here are
relatively simple.  They provide:

 

    202. (1) [now s. 219 ]  Every one is
criminally negligent who

 

(a) in doing anything, or

 

(b) in omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do,

 

shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or
safety of other persons.

 

    (2)  For the purposes of this section,
""duty"" means a duty imposed by law.

 

    203. [now
s. 220 ]  Every one who by criminal negligence causes death to another
person is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for
life.

 

    The
use of the word ""negligence"" suggests that the impugned conduct must
depart from a standard objectively determined.  On the other hand, the use of
the words ""wanton and reckless disregard"" suggests that an ingredient
of the offence includes a state of mind or some moral quality to the conduct
which attracts the sanctions of the criminal law.  The section makes it clear
that the conclusion that there is a wanton or reckless disregard is to be drawn
from the conduct which falls below the standard.  The major disagreement in the
cases centers around the manner in which this conclusion is to be drawn.

 

    On
the one hand, there are the cases that hold that it is to be done on an
objective basis.  If the conduct is a marked departure from the norm, then,
based on the standard of an ordinary prudent individual, the accused ought to
have known that his actions could endanger the lives or safety of others.  On
the other hand, there are cases that apply a subjective standard and require
some degree of advertence to the risk to be proved.  This may be done by
inferring advertence from the nature of the conduct in the context of the
surrounding circumstances.  A refinement on the latter view is that a marked
departure constitutes a prima facie case of
negligence.  The trier of fact may but is not obliged to infer the necessary
mental element from the conduct which is found to depart substantially from the
norm.

 

    In
both the objective and subjective approaches, the court is determining
foreseeability of consequences.  In a civil negligence case concerned with
adjustment of losses, the connection between conduct and consequences is often
quite tenuous.  The mythical reasonable man has been equipped with a great deal
of clairvoyance in order to compensate the innocent victim.  Often the
defendant will not, in fact, have foreseen the consequences of his negligent
acts for which he is held accountable on an objective basis.  In a criminal
case the connection must be more substantial.  To establish recklessness, the
consequences must be more obvious.  That is the rationale for the requirement
of a marked departure from the norm.  The greater the risk created, the easier
it is to conclude that a reasonably prudent person would have foreseen the
consequences.  Equally, it is easier to conclude that the accused must have
foreseen the consequences.  It is apparent, therefore, that as the risk of harm
increases, the significance of the distinction between the objective and
subjective approaches decreases.  The ultimate in this process of reasoning is
reached when the risk is so high that the consequences are the natural result of
the conduct creating the risk.  The conduct in such circumstances can be
characterized as intentional.

 

    A
finding that the impugned conduct is a marked departure from the standard is,
accordingly, central to both the objective and subjective approaches.  In R. v.
Tutton, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1392, this Court was divided as to
which approach is correct.  McIntyre J., with whom Lamer J. and
L'Heureux-Dubé J. concurred, was of the view that an objective test ought
to be adopted.  Wilson J., with whom the Chief Justice and
La Forest J. concurred, preferred a subjective test.  In his reasons
at p. 1431, McIntyre J. stated:

 

The test
is that of reasonableness, and proof of conduct which reveals a marked and
significant departure from the standard which could be expected of a reasonably
prudent person in the circumstances will justify a conviction of criminal
negligence.

 

Wilson J.
also underlined the importance of a finding of conduct which constitutes a
marked departure from the norm.  She states, at p. 1408:

 

It can be
assumed that a person functioning with normal faculties of awareness and
engaging in conduct which represents such a grave departure from the norm is
either aware of the risk or is wilfully blind to the risk.  Proof of the
conduct will, in other words, cast an evidential burden on the accused to
explain why the normal inference of conscious awareness or wilful blindness
should not be drawn.

 

    Lamer J.,
in a separate judgment concurring in the result with McIntyre J., was of
the view that the objective test was the correct one with a generous allowance
for certain individual factors.  He referred to the fact that the conduct under
consideration is ""high risk conduct"".

 

Criminal
Negligence -- Application to This Case

 

    In
this case as in most of these cases there is no direct evidence of the state of
mind of the appellant.  The conclusion that he had a wanton or reckless
disregard for the lives and safety of others must be drawn from the conduct
which is alleged to be a marked departure from the norm.  If an objective
standard is employed, this will be determined on the basis of the state of mind
of an ordinary prudent person in the circumstances.  If the subjective standard
or its refinement are applied, then the conclusion, if drawn, must be drawn
from the conduct of the appellant.

 

    The
conduct relied on in this case is (a) the combination of drinking and driving,
and (b) the breach of a traffic light regulation.  Clearly the trial judge
considered both.  He concluded that the conduct was not a marked departure from
the norm.  That being the case, a conclusion that the appellant had a wanton or
reckless disregard for the lives and safety of others could not be drawn on
either a subjective or objective basis.

 

    The
trial judge specifically addressed the question of the drinking and driving. 
The Court of Appeal agreed that this was so.  Nevertheless he was not prepared
to find that this, together with the traffic violation, was sufficient.  It
left him in a state of doubt.  No doubt setting out to drive after drinking in
some circumstances may be sufficient to conclude either objectively or
subjectively that there is a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives and
safety of others.  It will not be so, however, in every case.  The contrary
conclusion would render redundant subss. (2) and (3) of s. 237 (now s.
255) of the Criminal Code   which provide
specific penalties for causing death or bodily harm through the operation of a
motor vehicle while impaired.  The decision, however, in each case is one of
fact, and in this case the trial judge was not prepared to so conclude.

 

    Was
this finding affected by the reference to intention?  The statement in context
is as follows:  ""nor is mens rea, or the intention required to be proved
by the Crown.  It matters not what the man's intention was when he entered the
automobile to put it into use.""  I do not read this statement to mean that
the evidence that the appellant chose to drive his car knowing he had been
drinking was not relevant.  Such an interpretation would constitute too
microscopic an approach to the trial judge's reasons.  Clearly, the trial judge
went on to consider the relevance of this evidence.  What the trial judge was
dealing with here was the Crown's obligation.  Intention need not be proved by
the Crown.  From the Crown's point of view, it did not matter that the appellant
intended to drive safely when he entered the automobile.  The sentence
following the above-quoted passage emphasizes that this is the context in which
the statement is made:  ""Nevertheless, of course, the Crown must carry its
burden . . . .""

 

    The
trial judge's statement that the consequences are not relevant must also be
dealt with in the context in which it was made.  This reference is undoubtedly
one to the tragic death of the passenger in the other vehicle involved in the
collision.  The death of the passenger was a necessary ingredient of the actus reus.  It
was not otherwise relevant unless a conclusion could be drawn from it with
respect to whether there was a wanton and reckless disregard for the lives and
safety of other persons.  It was not suggested by the Crown that it was a
circumstance from which such a conclusion could be drawn either on an objective
or subjective basis.

 

    In
the circumstances of this case, the unfortunate fact that a person was killed
added nothing to the conduct of the appellant.  The degree of negligence proved
against the appellant by means of the evidence that he drove after drinking and
went through a red light was not increased by the fact that a collision
occurred and death resulted.  If driving and drinking and running a red light
was not a marked departure from the standard, it did not become so because a
collision occurred.  In some circumstances, perhaps, the actions of the accused
and the consequences flowing from them may be so interwoven that the consequences
may be relevant in characterizing the conduct of the accused.  That is not the
case here.

 

    In
my opinion, the trial judge came to the conclusion on the evidence that there
was a reasonable doubt that the conduct of the accused constituted criminal
negligence.  He was entitled to do so on the facts.  Although he made some
general remarks that perhaps should not have been made without elaboration, I
am satisfied that no error of law resulted.  In any event, the statements to
which I have alluded did not affect the outcome.  The respondent has not
satisfied me that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same.  The
Court of Appeal ought not to have set aside the acquittal.

 

    In
view of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to deal with the appellant's submissions
with respect to R. v. Caldwell, [1981] 1 All E.R.
961, nor the appellant's submissions that the judgment of the Manitoba Court of
Appeal is inconsistent with the principle in R. v. Vaillancourt,
[1987]  2 S.C.R. 636.

    Criminal
law -- Autrefois acquit -- Issue estoppel -- Kienapple principle -- Accused
charged in Canada of breach of trust after being acquitted in the U.S. of three
charges based on the same facts and circumstances  -- Application of the
principles of double jeopardy -- Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 111,
534, 535, 537.

 

    Constitutional
law -- Charter of Rights  -- Double jeopardy  --  Accused charged in Canada of
breach of trust after being acquitted in the U.S. of three charges based on the
same facts and circumstances -- Whether accused can benefit from the protection
of s. 11(h) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms?

 

    The
appellant, an R.C.M.P. officer and a member of an international drug
enforcement team, was arrested in Florida and charged in the U.S. with
soliciting and accepting bribes in exchange for information given to him by the
American authorities.  The appellant was acquitted at trial.  He was
subsequently charged in Canada with breach of trust under s. 111  of the Criminal Code .  The
trial judge held that the appellant had already been acquitted of the same
offences in the U.S. and ordered a stay of proceedings.  The Court of Appeal
allowed the Crown's appeal, rejected the plea of autrefois acquit and
ordered that the trial proceed.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

    The
double jeopardy concept is a principle of general application which is
expressed in the form of more specific rules, such as the plea of autrefois
acquit, issue estoppel and the Kienapple
principle.  Despite their common origin, these principles differ in the way
they are applied.  The application of s. 11 (h) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  must be determined by considering the
wording of this provision.  The Court of Appeal thus erred in considering only
the defence of autrefois acquit without dealing
with the other defences raised by the appellant.

 

    The
defences put forward by the appellant are rejected.  To make out the defence of autrefois
acquit, an accused must show that the two charges laid against
him are the same.  In particular, he must prove that the following two
conditions have been met:  (1) the matter is the same, in whole or in part; and
(2) the new count must be the same as at the first trial, or be implicitly
included in that of the first trial, either in law or on account of the
evidence presented if it had been legally possible at that time to make the
necessary amendments.  In the present case, the appellant could not have been
convicted on the American charges of the offences with which he is charged in
Canada even if the necessary amendments (not altering the nature of the
offence) had been made.  The Canadian charges deal with Canadian events,
require no proof of payment in exchange for information or illegal influence
and are based on a breach of trust by a Canadian official in relation to the
people of Canada.  They are thus clearly different from the American charges.

 

    The Kienapple
principle does not apply to offences involving different victims.  Since in the
present case the appellant had a general duty of loyalty to the Canadian people
and a temporary duty of loyalty to the United States, the Kienapple
principle is not applicable.

 

    A
court should not rule on an issue that has already been decided by another court. 
Issue estoppel, however, applies only in circumstances where it is clear from
the facts that the question has already been decided.  In the present case, in
view of the differences between the American and the Canadian charges, there is
nothing to indicate that the American jury found in the appellant's favour on
the particular issues raised in the Canadian charges.

 

    Finally,
s. 11(h) of the Charter  applies only in
circumstances where the two offences with which an accused is charged are the
same.  In the present case the American and Canadian offences are different
because they are based on duties of a different nature.  Even though the
American and Canadian offences are purely criminal in nature, the alleged
conduct of the appellant has a double aspect:  wrongdoing as a Canadian
official with a special duty to the Canadian public under s. 111 of the Code and
wrongdoing as an American official or member of the American public temporarily
subject to American law.  Since the offences relate to different duties, the
appellant must account for his conduct to the Canadian public as well as to the
American public.

    English
version of the judgment of the Court delivered by

 

    McLachlin
J. -- The point at issue in this case is as follows:  can a person,
specifically an R.C.M.P. officer, be prosecuted for offences under the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, after being acquitted
in the United States of three charges based on the same facts and circumstances
as those submitted to the Canadian court?

 

    The
facts may be summarized as follows:  officer Van Rassel worked for the R.C.M.P.
in Roberval.  The latter was conducting an investigation in Montréal together
with the United States Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration,
in the Southern District of Florida.  In his official capacity as a member of
the international team, Van Rassel received official reports from the United
States Drug Enforcement Administration.  The reports implicated Mr. Réal
Gaudreau, a former resident of the Lac St‑Jean area living in Hollywood,
Florida at the time.  Van Rassel applied for and obtained vacation leave and
went to Florida.  It was alleged that Van Rassel met with Gaudreau and
disclosed to him confidential information contained in some of the reports in
question.

 

    The
American authorities filed a complaint against Van Rassel.  The charges
mentioned that Van Rassel had solicited and accepted bribes in exchange for
information given to him by the American authorities, thereby contravening 18
U.S.C. {SS} 201(c).  Van Rassel was acquitted after a jury trial.

 

    The
U.S. charges read as follows:

 

    The Grand Jury charges that:

 

    1.  At all times relevant to this Indictment,
defendant MICHAEL ADRIAN VAN RASSEL was a constable in the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police in Roberval, Quebec, Canada.

 

    2.  At all times relevant to this Indictment, the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police were assisting the United States Department of
Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, in an investigation being conducted
in the Southern District of Florida by following investigative leads in Canada.

 

    3.  At all times relevant to this Indictment,
defendant MICHAEL ADRIAN VAN RASSEL received confidential Drug Enforcement
Administration investigative reports in Roberval, Canada in his official
capacity in connection with said investigation.

 

    1.  On or about May 1, 1985, at Dade County,
in the Southern District of Florida, and elsewhere, the defendant, MICHAEL
ADRIAN VAN RASSEL, knowingly and willfully did travel in interstate and
foreign commerce, from Montréal, Canada, to Miami, Florida with intent
to promote and carry on and facilitate the promotion and carrying on of an
unlawful activity, that is, the solicitation and acceptance of a bribe,
in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 201(c), and thereafter
performed and attempted to perform acts to promote and carry on and facilitate
the promotion and carrying on of said unlawful activity, by seeking and
obtaining payment for the unauthorized disclosure of confidential investigative
information of the United States Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement
Administration; in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section
1952(a)(3).

 

    2.  On or about May 5, 1985, at Dade County, in the
Southern District of Florida, the defendant, MICHAEL ADRIAN VAN RASSEL, knowingly,
willfully and without authority did convey a record and thing of value of the
United States, which value exceeded $100, that is, confidential law
enforcement information in an investigative report of the United States
Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration; in violation of Title
18, United States Code, Section 641.

 

    3. 
Between on or about May 3, 1985 and on or about May 9, 1985, at Dade County
in the Southern District of Florida, the defendant, MICHAEL ADRIAN VAN RASSEL, being
a public official, acting for and on behalf of the . . . Drug Enforcement
Administration, in an official function, that is, as a constable in the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police assisting the Drug Enforcement Administration in an
investigation being conducted under and by the authority of the Drug
Enforcement Administration knowingly, willfully and corruptly, directly and
indirectly, did ask, demand, exact, solicit, seek, accept, receive and agree
to receive a thing of value, that is, money, for himself, in return for being
influenced in the performance of official acts and being induced to do acts in
violation of his official duty, in that the defendant, MICHAEL ADRIAN VAN
RASSEL, accepted a $2,000 cash payment and did agree to receive an
additional $20,000 cash payment for the unauthorized disclosure of confidential
investigative reports and information of the United States Department of
Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration; in violation of Title 18, United
States Code, Section 201(c).  [Emphasis added.]

 

    Van
Rassel was subsequently charged in Canada with breach of trust. The charges
read as follows:

    The
trial judge accepted the accused's arguments that he could not be prosecuted in
Canada because he had already been acquitted in the U.S. of the same offences. 
The judge accordingly ordered a stay of proceedings on the Canadian charges. 
The trial judge relied on the rules and principles of the plea of autrefois
acquit, res judicata, the rule in Kienapple
v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, the maxim nemo debet
bis vexari pro una et eadem causa and s. 11 (h) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

    The
Quebec Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the Crown's appeal, rejecting the
plea of autrefois acquit, but it did not rule on the other principles argued by
the accused: [l988] R.J.Q 112, 11 Q.A.C. 151.  In the Court of Appeal's view,
the Canadian charges differed from the U.S. charges, especially in that the
Canadian charges were based on a breach of trust toward Canada:  hence the
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.

 

    The
accused argued that the Court of Appeal erred in considering only the question
of autrefois acquit and in holding that the American and Canadian charges
were different in composition.

 

Points
in Issue

 

1.Do the principles relating to the concept of double
jeopardy apply between two nations?

 

2.If the answer to the first question is yes, does
applying the principles of double jeopardy lead to the conclusion that the
trial judge was right in ordering a stay of proceedings against the accused?

 

Discussion

 

1.Do the
Principles Relating to the Concept of Double Jeopardy Apply Between Two Nations?

 

    The
common law authorities have accepted the proposition that the concept of double
jeopardy may apply between two nations:  Halsbury's Laws of
England (4th ed. 1976), vol. 2, para. 88; R. v.
Thomas, [1985] Q.B. 604 (C.A.)  In this regard, Martin J.A. of
the Ontario Court of Appeal wrote in R. v. Stratton (1978),
3 C.R. (3d) 289, at p. 298 (obiter), that the plea of autrefois
acquit applies to foreign convictions.  In his view, s.
535(5) (a) of the Criminal Code  refers
to an acquittal or to a conviction, including a conviction or acquittal in
another country.  In Libman v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
178, at p. 212, La Forest J., after ruling that each of the countries had
a concomitant jurisdiction to try the offenders, said the following:

 

    I am
also aware that the view I have taken leaves open the possibility that a person
could be prosecuted for the same offence in more than one country, but any
injustice that might result from this eventuality could be avoided by resort to
the pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois
convict, which have been applied to persons tried in other
countries; [Emphasis added.]

 

    Additionally,
the American courts have held that the double jeopardy rule does not preclude
two prosecutions for the same offence, one for a breach of federal law and the
other for a breach of State law, noting that applying the double jeopardy
principle in such circumstances could adversely affect the sovereignty of each
government:  Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S. 187
(1959); Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121 (1959).  The problem
does not arise in this form in Canada, in view of the federal Parliament's
supreme powers.  Still, it can be argued by analogy that a rule which prohibits
the Canadian government from prosecuting someone because of an earlier
conviction or acquittal in another country adversely affects Canadian
sovereignty.

 

    In
view of the conclusion I have arrived at on the second question, it is not
necessary to decide in this case which of these two positions should prevail.

 

2.If the
Answer to the First Question is Yes, Does Applying the Principles of Double
Jeopardy Lead to the Conclusion That the Trial Judge Was Right in Ordering a
Stay of Proceedings Against the Accused?

 

    Before
answering this question, an answer must first be given to the following
question:  did the Court of Appeal err in considering only the defence of autrefois
acquit, without dealing with the other principles relied on by
the accused, namely res judicata, the rule in Kienapple, the
Latin maxim nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa and s.
11 (h) of the Charter ?

 

    I
would answer this question in the affirmative.  The double jeopardy concept
expressed in the Latin maxim cited is a principle of general application which
is expressed in the form of more specific rules, such as the plea of autrefois
acquit, issue estoppel and the rule stated in Kienapple.  The
term res judicata, likewise, has sometimes been used in a broad sense to
comprise all of these various principles, though since Laskin J. (as he then
was) expressed his preference for the term in Kienapple, at
p. 748, to describe the principle in that case it has often been used as a
term of art.  The case law shows that these principles differ in the way they
are applied, despite their common origin.  The application of s. 11 (h) of the Charter  must be
determined by considering the wording of this provision.  For these reasons,
each of the defences put forward by the accused must be considered separately.

 

    (a) 
Autrefois acquit

 

    The
defence of autrefois acquit is codified in the Criminal
Code .  The relevant sections read as follows:

 

    534. (1)  An accused who is called upon to
plead may plead guilty or not guilty, or the special pleas authorized by
this Part and no others.

 

    535. (1)  An accused may plead the special
pleas of

 

(a)  autrefois acquit,

 

(b)  autrefois convict, and

 

(c)  pardon.

 

                                                                          . . .

 

    (5) Where an accused pleads autrefois
acquit or autrefois convict it is sufficient
if he

 

(a)  states that he has been lawfully acquitted,
convicted or discharged under subsection 662.1(1), as the case may be, of
the offence charged in the count to which the plea relates;

 

    537. (1)  Where an issue on a plea of autrefois
acquit or autrefois convict to a count is
tried and it appears 

 

(a)  that the matter on which the accused was given
in charge on the former trial is the same in whole or in part as that on
which it is proposed to give him in charge, and

 

(b)  that on the former trial, if all proper amendments
had been made that might then have been made, he might have been convicted of
all the offences of which he may be convicted on the count to which the plea of autrefois
acquit or autrefois convict is
pleaded,

 

the
judge shall give judgment discharging the accused in respect of that count. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

    To
make out the defence of autrefois acquit, the accused must
show that the two charges laid against him are the same.  In particular, he
must prove that the following two conditions have been met:

 

(1)  the matter is the same, in whole or in part; and

 

(2)  the new count must be the same as at the first
trial, or be implicitly included in that of the first trial, either in law or
on account of the evidence presented if it had been legally possible at that
time to make the necessary amendments.

 

    It
is sometimes difficult to apply the principle of autrefois acquit to
charges arising in criminal law systems completely different from our own. 
While the laws of different countries are rarely the same, it must be
recognized that the plea of autrefois acquit is based on the
principle of justice and fairness and that the Criminal Code  does
not require that the charges be absolutely identical.  Despite the technical
form of the relevant sections of the Criminal Code , the
substantive point is a simple one:  could the accused have been convicted at
the first trial of the offence with which he is now charged?  If the
differences between the charges at the first and second trials are such that it
must be concluded that the charges are different in nature, the plea of autrefois
acquit is not appropriate.  On the other hand, the plea will
apply if, despite the differences between the earlier and the present charges,
the offences are the same.  For example, the presence under foreign law of a
defence which does not exist under domestic law will not prevent the principle
of autrefois acquit from applying:  R. v. Aughet (1918),
118 L.T. 658 (C.A.)

 

    The
elements of the Canadian charges are as follows:

 

1.  At Roberval (in the province of Quebec), between
February 22 and May 3, the accused (counts 1, 2, 3 and 4),

 

2.  Being a Canadian official (counts 1, 2, 3 and 4),

 

3.  Committed a breach of trust in connection with his
duties as a Canadian official (counts 1, 2, 3 and 4),

 

4.  That is to say, converted to his personal use
(confidential information contained in two reports and a telex (counts 1 and
3), copies, photocopies or reproductions of two reports and a telex containing
confidential information (counts 2 and 4)) from the Drug Enforcement Administration,

 

5.  With the intent to derive a profit therefrom (counts
1 and 2).

 

    Applying
the principle of autrefois acquit, the question
which arises in this case is the following:  could the accused have been
convicted on the American charges of the offences with which he is charged in
Canada if the necessary amendments (not altering the nature of the offence) had
been made?

 

    In
my opinion the answer to this question must be no.  First, the Canadian charges
are limited to events which occurred in Canada.  None of the American charges
would have been laid if, for example, the accused had copied the telex in
Canada without taking the copies to the United States.  Only the first American
charge mentions Montréal, and it does so only with reference to the question of
""interstate travel"", which does not arise in the Canadian charges.

 

    Second,
the conduct referred to in the American and Canadian charges is different. 
American counts 1 and 3 require that the accused be an American official
(according to a very broad definition) and that there should have been a
transaction, that is an exchange of money for information or to exert illegal
influence.  The Canadian charges, for their part, require that the accused be a
Canadian official and make no reference to any exchange of money.

 

    The
second American count requires only that a transaction have taken place.  The
count mentions that the accused ""did convey a record and thing of value of
the United States"".  The provision under which the charge was laid (18
U.S.C. {SS} 641) states that it is a crime for anyone to ""knowingly
convert [. . .] to his use . . . [a] record . . . or thing of value of the
United States"".

 

    Viewing
this case in the light most favorable to the appellant, it could be assumed
that the second count could have been amended to read as follows: 
""Michael Adrian Van Rassel did knowingly convert to his use a record or
thing of value of the United States""; this aspect of the charge would then
have been the same as the Canadian charges.

 

    I am
of the view, however, that the identity test in s. 537(1)(b) has
not been met.  Even as amended, the second American charge would not include
one essential element of the Canadian charge, that of being a Canadian
official, because this latter element is not part of the offence defined in 18
U.S.C. {SS} 641.  (The American provision in question does not require that the
accused be an official.)

 

    This
analysis leads me to conclude that the accused could not have been convicted in
the United States for offences of the same nature as those in the Canadian
charges.  Since the Canadian charges deal with Canadian events, require no
proof of payment in exchange for information or illegal influence and are based
on a breach of trust by a Canadian official in relation to the people of
Canada, they are clearly different from the American charges.

 

    For
these reasons, I conclude that the plea of autrefois acquit does
not apply in the circumstances.

 

    (b) 
Rule in Kienapple

 

    This
rule, which is said to be based on the broader principle of res judicata,
applies when two separate charges are based on the same delict or cause.  It
prescribes that a conviction cannot be registered on the second charge if there
has been a conviction on the first charge.  The same delict or cause is
involved where there is no additional and distinguishing element contained in
the offence that goes to guilt:  R. v. Prince, [1986]
2 S.C.R. 480.

 

    The
rule stated in Kienapple does not assist the accused's case as
the rule does not apply to offences involving different victims (assuming
without deciding the point that the rule in Kienapple applies
to charges laid after an acquittal).  In Prince,
Dickson C.J. wrote, at pp. 506-7:

 

It would appear from this passage that, at least in so
far as crimes of personal violence are concerned, the rule against multiple
convictions is inapplicable when the convictions relate to different victims. 
Indeed, I believe it was never within the contemplation of the majority in Kienapple that
the rule enunciated therein would preclude two convictions for offences
respectively containing as elements the injury or death of two different
persons.

 

    Society,
through the criminal law, requires Prince to answer for both the injury to
Bernice Daniels and the death of the child, just as it would require a person
who threw a bomb into a crowded space to answer for the multiple injuries and
deaths that might result, and just as it compels a criminally negligent driver
to answer for each person injured or killed as a result of his or her driving: 
see R. v. Birmingham and Taylor (1976), 34 C.C.C.
(2d) 386 (Ont. C.A.)

 

    There
is no question in this case of bodily injuries to different victims.  Multiple
victims are nonetheless involved.  Van Rassel had a general duty of loyalty to
the Canadian people and a temporary duty of loyalty to the United States, based
on the trust placed in him.

 

    For
this reason, I am of the view that the rule in Kienapple does
not apply in the circumstances.

 

    (c) Issue
Estoppel

 

    The
rule that a court should not rule on an issue that has already been decided by
another court is a fundamental principle of our system of justice.  The fact
that a matter has already been the subject of a judicial decision may raise an
estoppel against the party seeking to relitigate the matter.  This is the
principle of issue estoppel, and it too is related to the principle of res
judicata.  Issue estoppel is recognized in Canadian criminal
law:  Gushue v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 798.

 

    The
respondent suggests that issue estoppel could not apply with respect to a
foreign criminal judgment since the parties involved are not the same.  It will
not be necessary to decide this point since it is well established that the
principle applies only in circumstances where it is clear from the facts that
the question has already been decided.  Laskin C.J. wrote in Gushue, at
p. 807:

 

    I am of opinion that the question of issue estoppel
in respect of the robbery conviction is put to rest by the following statement,
which I adopt, in Friedland, Double Jeopardy (1969), at
p. 134:

 

    . .
. The possibility or even the probability that the jury found in the accused's
favour on a particular issue is not enough.  A finding on the relevant issue
must be the only rational explanation of the verdict of the jury.

 

See also Wright v.
The Queen, [1963] S.C.R. 539; Connelly v. Director
of Public Prosecutions, [1964] A.C. 1254.

 

    In
the present case there is nothing to indicate that the American jury found in
the accused's favour on the particular issues raised in the Canadian charges. 
The jury might have acquitted the accused for reasons entirely distinct from
those underlying the Canadian jury's decision.  This becomes apparent when we
consider the differences between the American and Canadian charges.  The result
might perhaps have been different if the appellant had adduced in evidence the
opinion of an expert in American law establishing that an issue in the Canadian
proceedings had been decided in his favour in the United States, but he did
nothing in this regard.  This defence thus does not assist the accused's case.

 

    (d) Section
11 (h) of the Charter 

 

    Section
11 (h) reads as follows:

 

11.Any person charged with an offence has the right

 

                                                                          . . .

 

(h)  if
finally acquitted of the offence, not to be tried for it again and, if finally
found guilty and punished for the offence, not to be tried or punished for it
again;

 

    Section
11 (h) of the Charter  applies only in
circumstances where the two offences with which the accused is charged are the
same.  In R. v. Wigglesworth, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
541, this Court held that the same act can give rise to different offences,
each offence being based on a separate duty.  Wilson J. said, at p. 566:

 

    I
would hold that the appellant in this case is not being tried and punished for
the same offence.  The ""offences"" are quite different.  One is an
internal disciplinary matter.  The accused has been found guilty of a major
service offence and has, therefore, accounted to his profession.  The other
offence is the criminal offence of assault.  The accused must now account to
society at large for his conduct.  He cannot complain, as a member of a special
group of individuals subject to private internal discipline, that he ought not
to account to society for his wrongdoing.  His conduct has a double aspect as a
member of the R.C.M.P. and as a member of the public at large.  To borrow from
the words of the Chief Justice quoted above, I am of the view that the two
offences were ""two different `matters', totally separate one from the
other and not alternative one to the other"".  While there was only one act
of assault there were two distinct delicts, causes or matters which would
sustain separate convictions.

 

In the
present case the American and Canadian offences are different because they are
based on duties of a different nature.  Even though the American and Canadian
offences are purely criminal in nature, the alleged conduct of the accused has
a double aspect:  first, wrongdoing as a Canadian official with a special duty
to the Canadian public under s. 111  of the Criminal Code , and
second, wrongdoing as an American official or member of the American public,
temporarily subject to American law.  The accused must now account for his conduct
to the Canadian public as well as to the American public, as the offences
relate to different duties.  For this reason, I am of the opinion that s. 11 (h) of the Charter  is of
no assistance to the accused.

 

Conclusion

 

    For
all these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and refer the matter back to the
trial judge for the trial to proceed.

This appeal raises the
question of the existence and scope of the power of the police to search a
person who has been lawfully arrested.  The appellants, both officers with the
Montréal Urban Community Police Department, stopped the vehicle driven by the
respondent after the latter had violated a municipal by‑law.  They
proceeded to arrest him upon being informed by police headquarters that a
warrant of committal for unpaid traffic fines had been issued against him in
Municipal Court.  Highly agitated and abusive, the respondent accompanied the
officers to their car, where they carried out a ""frisk"" search:  with
the respondent's hands on the hood of the car and his legs spread, the officers
patted him down.  The respondent was then taken to the police station, where he
filed an information against each of the police officers for common assault. 
At trial, the respondent argued that the police officers were not authorized to
search him and that the search was an assault within the meaning of s. 245 (b)
of the Criminal Code .  The Summary Convictions Court judge dismissed the
informations and this judgment was upheld by the Superior Court.  The Court of
Appeal in a majority judgment allowed the respondent's appeal and entered a
verdict of guilty.  Section 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
was not invoked by the parties.

 

Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 

Determining the legality
of the search in this case is strictly a question of law within the meaning of
s. 771(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .  The resolution of the dispute
as to the basis of the power to carry out a search after an arrest is not
dependent on the facts, since it concerns the exact scope of the legal rule.

 

At common law a police
officer may carry out a ""frisk"" search of a person who has been
lawfully arrested and the existence of reasonable and probable grounds is not a
prerequisite to the existence of such a power.  A ""frisk"" search
incidental to a lawful arrest reconciles the public's interest in the effective
and safe enforcement of the law and its interest in ensuring the freedom and
dignity of individuals since it constitutes a minimal intrusion on individual
rights which is necessary to ensure that criminal justice is properly
administered.

 








The exercise of the power
to search is not however unlimited.  First, this power does not impose a duty. 
The police have some discretion and, if satisfied that the law can be
effectively and safely applied, they may see fit not to conduct a search.  They
must also be in a position to assess the circumstances of each case so as to
determine whether a search meets the underlying objectives forming the basis of
the right to search.  Second, as regards these objectives, the search must be
for a valid objective in pursuit of the ends of criminal justice ‑‑
such as the discovery of an object that may be a threat to the safety of the
police, the accused or the public, or that may facilitate escape or act as
evidence against the accused ‑‑ and the purpose of the search must
not be unrelated to the objectives of the proper administration of justice. 
Third, the search must not be conducted in an abusive fashion, and in
particular, the use of physical or psychological constraint should be
proportionate to the objectives sought and the other circumstances of the
situation.  A search which does not meet these objectives could be
characterized as unreasonable and unjustified at common law.

 

In this case, the frisk
search of the respondent was justified.  The evidence showed that the police
carried out the search taking into account all the circumstances and the
desired objectives, that they searched the respondent in pursuit of a valid
objective, i.e., police safety in making a lawful arrest, and that the search
was conducted without excessive constraint.  Therefore the Summary Convictions
Court judge made no error in dismissing the informations for assault brought
against the appellants.

APPEAL from a judgment of
the Quebec Court of Appeal, [1987] R.J.Q. 1479, 7 Q.A.C. 169, allowing an
appeal by respondent from a judgment of the Superior Court[1],
dismissing respondent's appeal from the acquittals of the appellants pronounced
by a judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace[2],
on informations for common assault laid by respondent.  Appeal allowed.

//L'Heureux-Dubé//

 

The judgment of the Court
was delivered by

 

L'HEUREUX‑DUBÉ J.
-- This appeal raises squarely, for the first time in this Court the question
of the existence and scope of the power of the police to search a person who
has been lawfully arrested.

 

Facts

 

The facts out of which
this issue arose are not in dispute and may be summarized as follows.  The
appellants Langlois and Bédard are constables employed by the police department
of the Montréal Urban Community.  The respondent Cloutier is a lawyer
practising in that city.  On November 3, 1983, early in the evening, the
respondent made a right turn from the centre lane of St‑Denis Street in
Montréal.  In so doing, the respondent's vehicle passed directly in front of a
police vehicle parked at the street corner.  The constables decided that the
respondent's turn was in breach of a municipal by‑law, stopped him and
asked for his driver's licence and other documents for identification
purposes.  As conceded by the respondent in this Court, [TRANSLATION] ""the
tone became somewhat heated"" during this exchange.

 








While constable Langlois
was writing up a notice of violation, officer Bédard learned by radio contact
with police headquarters that a warrant of committal had been issued against
the respondent in the Municipal Court for unpaid traffic fines.  The constables
informed the respondent and asked him to accompany them to the police station. 
When they asked the respondent to get into the patrol car, the constables
carried out a ""frisk"" search:  the hands of the accused were placed
on the hood of the car, his legs spread and the constables patted him down.  The
respondent was then taken to the police station.

 

Subsequent to these
events the respondent, relying on the provisions of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, dealing with summary convictions, filed an
information against each of the police officers for common assault, contrary to
s. 245 (b) of the Criminal Code .

 

The primary allegation
made by the respondent in his pleading was that the arrest was illegal, since
the police officers had no power to arrest him unless they had actual
possession of the arrest warrant issued by the Municipal Court.  The respondent
also argued incidentally that the police officers were not authorized to search
him.  He contended that the arrest and the search constituted assaults within
the meaning of the Criminal Code .  However, in the course of events, the
respondent's incidental submission became his principal argument.

 

Decisions of Quebec Courts

 

Summary Convictions Court

 








Judge Choquette dismissed
the informations laid against each of the two constables.  First, he found that
the arrest was lawful in light of ss. 25  and 29  of the Criminal Code ,
even though the police did not have in their possession at the time of the
search the arrest warrant issued by the Municipal Court.  The judge further
concluded that the Canadian law on the subject granted to the police officers
the power to search a lawfully arrested person.  He added that in the case at
bar the constables had reasonable grounds to conduct the search and the force
used was neither excessive nor disproportionate.  Though it is not clear from
the reasons of Judge Choquette, it appears that he relied on the common law,
not s. 25  of the Criminal Code , in concluding that a defence
existed against the information for assault.

 

Superior Court

 

Barrette‑Joncas J.,
who heard the appeal brought by the respondent, dismissed it on the ground that
the trial judge had committed no manifest error.

 

Court of Appeal

 

The Court of Appeal,
which granted leave to appeal [TRANSLATION] ""on questions of law
only"", in a majority judgment (Kaufman and McCarthy JJ.A.) allowed the
appeal and entered a verdict of guilty on the informations laid against each of
the police officers, Rothman J.A. dissenting:  [1987] R.J.Q. 1479.  However,
the court ruled unanimously that the arrest was lawful and justified by
s. 25  of the Criminal Code .  It was divided on the question of
whether the search was lawful, the majority concluding that in the
circumstances the search was illegal and therefore constituted an assault. 
Kaufman J.A. was of the opinion that the police officers did not have the power
to search the accused and that the search was a ""technical assault""
(p. 1481).  McCarthy J.A. also expressed the view that s. 25  of the Criminal
Code  did not protect the constables against an information for assault in
connection with the search (at p. 1481):

 

[TRANSLATION]  Although
opinion is divided it seems to be generally accepted that there is no common
law right to automatically search a person who has been arrested [Del Buono, Procédure
pénale au Canada (1983), at p. 180, note 136].  The right only exists
if the circumstances make such a search necessary to preserve evidence or to
prevent escape or the commission of another offence by the person arrested.  It
is clear in the case at bar that the respondents could not rely on any of these
grounds as reasonable or probable.  Cloutier was arrested only because he had
failed to pay a fine imposed ""for a traffic offence"".

 

                                                                                                                                                       .
. .








In my
view, s. 25  Cr. C. did not protect the respondents.  Though the force they
used in searching Cloutier was minimal, they were guilty of assault.

 

Rothman J.A. was of a
different opinion.  In his view, the police officers were justified in
conducting the search.  He also appears to have concluded that the legality of
the search is a defence at common law against an information for assault.  He
wrote (at pp. 1484-85):

 

The reasonableness of a
search made as an incident to a lawful arrest is, of course, a function of all
the circumstances that existed at the time of the arrest.  Often enough, these
decisions must be made in difficult circumstances and with little time for
reflection.  For this reason, while police officers have no automatic right to
conduct a personal search on making an arrest, I believe they must be accorded
some latitude in deciding whether or not it would be prudent to search and, if
so, the nature of the search that should be done.

 

                                                                                                                                                       .
. .

 

In my
respectful opinion, the personal search conducted by the police officers may
have been unnecessary but, in the circumstances, it was not unreasonable.

 

The Court of Appeal
accordingly appears to have unanimously held that at common law, in Canada, the
power to search a person lawfully arrested is not incidental to the arrest but
requires the existence of reasonable grounds, which in turn depends on the circumstances
of the particular case, circumstances which the majority and the dissenting
judge interpreted differently.  This Court granted leave to appeal in order to
determine the existence and scope of the police power of search at the time of
a lawful arrest.

 

Arguments

 

Besides the legality of
the search, the parties raised two other issues, namely the jurisdiction of the
Court of Appeal and costs.

 








Appellants

 

As to the legality of the
search, the appellants contend that if the power to search is not expressly
conferred by specific legislation such power has its origin in common law.  The
appellants submit that, at the time of arrest, the police may make a
[TRANSLATION] ""related or incidental"" search of the individual, for
safety reasons, in order to transport the person arrested or to preserve
evidence, provided of course that the search is not wrongful in the
circumstances.

 

So far as jurisdiction is
concerned, the appellants argue that the legality of the search is a mixed
question of law and fact.  They submit that the Court of Appeal had undertaken
a reassessment of the facts, though leave to appeal was granted on questions of
law only, in accordance with s. 771(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .

 

Respondent

 

The respondent, who
represented himself throughout the proceedings, did not file a brief in this
Court and confined his oral argument to the legality of the search.  He
contended that the power to search is not automatic but instead depends upon
the existence of reasonable grounds, especially in cases where the arrest is
made in connection with a penal rather than criminal offence.  In his view, the
search seriously compromised his human integrity and dignity.  He added that
the search, which occurred in public, in the neighbourhood where he lives and
practices his profession, had an adverse effect on his professional reputation.

 

In the event that the
appeal is allowed however, the respondent asked not to be ordered to pay
costs.  He stated that he brought the action [TRANSLATION] ""for the sake
of human justice and freedom, not through any desire for vengeance or in bad
faith"".








Neither of the parties
pleaded s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

Jurisdiction

 

I do not think that it is
necessary to deal with this matter at any length.  The respondent's principal
argument was not that the search was wrongful in the circumstances, but rather
that there was no legal basis for it.  Precedent and scholarly opinion are not
unanimous as to the basis of the power to search.  According to one view, the
power to carry out a search flows automatically from the arrest of an
individual, while another view feels that the existence of reasonable grounds
is a prerequisite.  The resolution of this dispute is not dependent on the
facts, since it concerns the exact scope of the legal rule, a rule essentially
derived from a series of common law precedents.  In this context, determining
the legality of the search seems to me to be strictly a question of law within
the meaning of s. 771(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .  The
appellants' argument therefore fails.

 

Legality of Search

 

In the absence of any
specific Canadian legislation, it is necessary to review the origin and
evolution of the common law rule.  It will also be instructive in my view to
see how the rule, originally developed by the English courts, has been treated
in the U.S., whose law is also derived from the common law and whose criminal
procedure is, in many areas, similar to that applicable in Canada.

 

British Precedent and Academic Opinion

 








The first common law
cases dealing with the right to ""frisk"" search a lawfully arrested
person date from the last century, though it appears that the practice has a
much longer history.  In Bessell v. Wilson (1853), 1 El. & Bl. 489,
118 E.R. 518, 17 J.P. 52 (Q.B.), an arrest warrant was issued against the
defendant requiring him to explain to the court the reason for his failure to
pay a fine which a court had ordered him to pay.  Upon arresting the defendant
under this warrant, the constable conducted a search.  The court in analyzing
the power to search observed (1 El. & Bl., at p. 492):

 

He was
apprehended by the police force for the city of London, and, upon being put
into custody, was searched; which, it was stated, was the invariable practice
of the city police.  Lord Campbell C.J., upon the motion for the rule mentioned
in the text, very strongly reprobated the application of the practice to such a
case.

 

Lord Campbell C.J. was
not so much concerned with the existence of the power as he was with the decision
of the police to search the accused on the facts of the case, and in this
regard stated (17 J.P., at p. 52):

 

. . . I wish to
take this opportunity of correcting a misapprehension as to what is my opinion
with respect to the practice of searching persons who are charged with
offences.  At the conclusion of the trial of this case, I expressed my
disapprobation of the manner in which the plaintiff had been searched when
taken to the station house.  I repeat the disapprobation which I then
expressed, for there is no right in a case of this kind to inflict the
indignity to which the plaintiff had been subjected.  But I have been informed
that an erroneous impression of what I said has gone abroad.  It was supposed
that I had said that there was no right in any one to search a prisoner at any
time.  I have not said so.  It is often the duty of an officer to search a
prisoner.  If for instance, a man is taken in [for] the commission of a felony,
he may be searched to see whether the stolen articles are in his possession, or
whether he has any instruments of violence about him, and, in like manner, if
he be taken on a charge of arson, he may be searched to see whether he has any
fire-boxes or matches about his person . . . . It may be highly
satisfactory, and indeed necessary that the prisoner should be searched.  I
have never said that searching a prisoner was always a forbidden act.  What I
said applied to circumstances such as existed in this case.  [Emphasis added.]

 








Leigh v. Cole (1853), 6 Cox C.C. 329, concerned a civil action for unjustified
arrest and assault brought against a police officer following the arrest of the
plaintiff.  The police officer arrested the plaintiff for disturbing the peace
and then searched him and seized a tobacco-box and a piece of paper that were
on his person.  The court decided that the arrest was justified.  In his charge
to the jury Williams J. made the following comments on the search (at
p. 332):

 

With respect to searching a
prisoner, there is no doubt that a man when in custody may so conduct himself,
by reason of violence of language or conduct, that a police officer may
reasonably think it prudent and right to search him, in order to ascertain
whether he has any weapon with which he might do mischief to the person or
commit a breach of the peace; but at the same time it is quite wrong to
suppose that any general rule can be applied to such a case.  Even when a
man is confined for being drunk and disorderly, it is not correct to say that
he must submit to the degradation of being searched, as the searching of
such a person must depend upon all the circumstances of the case. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

In Williams J.'s mind, the power to search a
lawfully arrested person does not flow automatically from the fact of the
arrest.

 

In another series of
cases, it was held that police officers are authorized to seize from a lawfully
arrested person evidence that can be used against that person.  These cases are
relevant in as much as the power to seize imports that of search.

 

R. v. Barnett (1829), 3 Car. & P. 600, 172 E.R. 563; R. v. Jones
(1834), 6 Car. & P. 343, 172 E.R. 1269; R. v. Kinsey (1836), 7 Car.
& P. 447, 173 E.R. 198, and R. v. O'Donnell (1835), 7 Car. & P.
138, 173 E.R. 61, hold that police officers have no right to seize property
from the arrested person unless it is connected with the charge against him. 
These cases implicitly recognize a right to seize property which may be used as
evidence.  This right was expressly acknowledged in the Irish case Dillon v.
O'Brien (1887), 16 Cox C.C. 245 (Exch.), a civil action for unjustified
arrest and seizure, trespass and assault (at p. 249):

 

I, therefore, think that it
is clear, and beyond doubt, that, at least in cases of treason and felony, constables
(and probably also private persons) are entitled, upon a lawful arrest by them
of one charged with treason or felony, to take and detain property found in his
possession which will form material evidence in his prosecution for that crime
. . . . [Emphasis added.]








In that case, the plaintiff was apprehended
under an arrest warrant issued in connection with the commission of an offence
punishable on summary conviction.  Palles C.B., speaking for the court,
dismissed the civil action and observed that the common law authorized the
seizure of evidence in such a case.  The judgment is silent however as to the
requirement of grounds in order to seize the plaintiff's money and documents. 
It does not appear, at least at this stage in the evolution of the common law,
that reasonable grounds had to exist.  Rather, the opposite would appear from Dillon
v. O'Brien.

 

The power of seizure was
later affirmed by the British courts in R. v. Lushington, [1894] 1 Q.B.
420, at p. 423:

 

In this
country I take it that it is undoubted law that it is within the power of, and
is the duty of, constables to retain for use in Court things which may be
evidences of crime, and which have come into the possession of the constables
without wrong on their part.

 

In Elias v. Pasmore,
[1934] 2 K.B. 164, constables who entered premises to arrest a suspect seized
documents belonging to other persons.  Although it was held that the scope of
the right did not justify the particular seizure in this case, the power of
search was upheld (at p. 169):

 

As to the right to search on
arrest.  This right seems to be clearly established by the footnote to Bessell
v. Wilson in the report in the Law Times, where Lord Campbell
clearly lays down that this right exists, but this right does not seem to me to
authorize what was done in this case, namely, to seize and take away large
quantities of documents and other property found on premises occupied by
persons other than the person of whom the arrest was made.

 








In two recent cases the
British courts again ruled on the power of police officers to seize property in
the possession of a person lawfully in custody in circumstances where that
property is likely to threaten the safety of either the prisoner or the police
officers.  In R. v. Naylor, [1979] Crim. L.R. 532, the court held
that the seizure of a necklace and other jewellery owned by a woman charged
with obstructing justice was unjustified, and in Lindley v. Rutter,
[1981] Q.B. 128, the seizure of the brassiere of a woman charged with
disturbing the peace was also found to be illegal.  Though the seizures in
these judgments were found to be illegal, the power of search itself was not
disputed.  It was held that the interference with individual rights was
disproportionate to the importance of the objective sought.  These cases are
exceptions that prove the rule.  They confirmed and set limits on the power to
search and seize in the context of a lawful arrest.  In Lindley,
Donaldson L.J. said the following on the power to search a lawfully arrested
person (at pp. 134-35):

 

It is the duty of the
courts to be ever zealous to protect the personal freedom, privacy and dignity
of all who live in these islands.  Any claim to be entitled to take action
which infringes these rights is to be examined with great care.  But such
rights are not absolute.  They have to be weighed against the rights and duties
of police officers, acting on behalf of society as a whole.  It is the duty of
any constable who lawfully has a prisoner in his charge to take all reasonable
measures to ensure that the prisoner does not escape or assist others to do so,
does not injure himself or others, does not destroy or dispose of evidence and
does not commit further crime such as, for example, malicious damage to
property.  This list is not exhaustive, but it is sufficient for present
purposes.  What measures are reasonable in the discharge of this duty will
depend upon the likelihood that the particular prisoner will do any of these
things unless prevented.  That in turn will involve the constable in
considering the known or apparent disposition and sobriety of the prisoner. 
What can never be justified is the adoption of any particular measures without
regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.

 

This is
not to say there can be no standing instructions.  Although there may always be
special features in any individual case, the circumstances in which people are
taken into custody are capable of being categorised and experience may show
that certain measures, including searches, are prima facie reasonable and
necessary in a particular category of case.  The fruits of this experience may
be passed on to officers in the form of standing instructions.  But the officer
having custody of the prisoner must always consider, and be allowed and
encouraged to consider, whether the special circumstances of the particular
case justify or demand a departure from the standard procedure either by
omitting what would otherwise be done or by taking additional measures.  So far
as searches are concerned, he should appreciate that they involve an affront to
the dignity and privacy of the individual.  Furthermore, there are degrees of
affront involved in such a search.  Clearly going through someone's pockets or
handbag is less an affront than a body search.  In every case a police
officer ordering a search or depriving a prisoner of property should have a
very good reason for doing so.  [Emphasis added.]

 

This case was recently affirmed:  Brazil
v. Chief Constable of Surrey, [1983] 3 All E.R. 537 (Q.B.)

 








Under the common law as
it has evolved in England, the existence of reasonable grounds does not appear
to be a prerequisite to searching a lawfully arrested person.  In Lindley,
supra, the court could simply have found that the police officers lacked
reasonable grounds, but instead, it left the door open to a wider
""justification"" for searches (at p. 135):

 

. . . a search would have been justified if,
bearing in mind the defendant's condition, including her reaction to being in
custody, W.P.C. Fry or the station officer had had any reason for
thinking that the defendant might have some object on her with which she might
accidentally or intentionally injure herself or others.

 

The
forcible removal of her brassiere was understandably regarded by the defendant
as peculiarly offensive.  Such conduct would require considerable justification
. . . . [T]here would have had to have been some evidence that young
female drunks in general were liable to injure themselves with their brassieres
or that the defendant had shown a peculiar disposition to do so.  It would
obviously be a justification if the defendant had by words or conduct
threatened to do so.  But that is not this case.  [Emphasis added.]

 

The ""some evidence"" standard
applied by Donaldson L.J. is a considerably different threshold than that of
""reasonable grounds"".  This is significant in view of the seriousness
of the invasion of human dignity which occurred in Lindley, as compared
to the ""frisk"" search which occurred in the case before us.

 

This line of authority
has been the subject of considerable scholarly comment.  To a large degree it
appears to be recognized that the common law authorizes the incidental search
of a lawfully arrested person.  Opinions differ mainly as to the extent of this
power.  L. H. Leigh, Police Powers in England and Wales (1975), at
p. 50, writes:

 

A
constable has a common law power to search a person on arrest and to take into
custody articles in possession of the prisoner which the constable believes to
be connected with the offence charged, or which may be used in evidence against
him, or which may give a clue to the commission of the crime or the
identification of the criminal, or any weapon or implement which might enable
the prisoner to commit an act of violence or effect his escape.

 








C. Hampton, Criminal Procedure (3rd
ed. 1982), at p. 41, essentially shares this view:

 

The police have further
powers at common law.  Firstly, they may search a person who has been lawfully
arrested and they may take and keep any property found in his possession which
may form material evidence of the offence for which he is arrested or of any
other serious offence which they reasonably believe he has committed.

 

St John A. Robilliard and J. McEwan, Police
Powers and the Individual (1986), at pp. 133-34, for their part, expressed
the view that:

 

At common law it has long
been recognised that the arrest of a suspect may justify searching him and his
immediate vicinity, although originally a search had to be justifiable
according to the overall circumstances; viz., the search of an arsonist for
matches was justified, as was the search of a person arrested for acting in a
disorderly way in order to ascertain whether he had on him a weapon which could
be used to harm himself or another.  However, as the twentieth century
progressed this has become seen as a general right to search on arrest. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

See also the discussion by D. Feldman, The
Law Relating to Entry, Search and Seizure (1986), at pp. 227-48.

 

The scope of the common
law rule has lost much of its importance in England since the adoption of the Police
and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (U.K.), 1984, c. 60.  In particular, s. 32
authorizes the search of a lawfully arrested person if ""the constable has
reasonable grounds for believing that the arrested person may present a danger
to himself or others"" (s. 32(1)) or reasonable grounds for believing
that the person has anything on him which he might use to escape or which might
be evidence (s. 32(1) and (5)).

 

U.S. Case Law and Scholarly Opinion

 








The appellants based
their argument in part on the U.S. rule, which reached its zenith in United
States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218 (1973), and Gustafson v. Florida,
414 U.S. 260 (1973).  In the United States the power to search is recognized as
being incidental to arrest and the police are not required to have reasonable
grounds for searching a lawfully arrested person.

 

In Robinson, the
police arrested the accused for driving without a licence, searched his
clothing and found a quantity of heroin on him.  A majority of the judges of
the Supreme Court held that this search did not contravene the Fourth Amendment
to the Constitution.  The court had to decide whether the police had the power
to conduct such a search.  The court exhaustively reviewed the U.S. precedents
and concluded that since the decision in Weeks v. United States, 232
U.S. 383 (1914), it has been recognized that the search of a lawfully arrested
person is incident to arrest.  Two older cases, Spalding v. Preston, 21
Vt. 9 (1848), and Closson v. Morrison, 47 N.H. 482 (1867), in the view
of the majority, illustrated that this power of search was well rooted in the
U.S. legal tradition.  In Robinson the majority left no doubt as to
their view that a search is incident to arrest and does not have to be
justified each time a police officer makes an arrest (at p. 235):

 

The authority to search
the person incident to a lawful custodial arrest, while based upon the need to
disarm and to discover evidence, does not depend on what a court may later
decide was the probability in a particular arrest situation that weapons or
evidence would in fact be found upon the person of the suspect.  A custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a
reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment; that intrusion being lawful, a
search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification.  It is
the fact of the lawful arrest which establishes the authority to search,
and we hold that in the case of a lawful custodial arrest a full search of the
person is not only an exception to the warrant requirement under the Fourth
Amendment, but is also a ""reasonable"" search under that Amendment. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

Similarly, in Gustafson
the majority clearly established that it was not necessary for the police to
believe on reasonable grounds that their safety was threatened prior to
searching the person arrested for weapons.

 








These two cases were
subsequently followed by the Supreme Court in Michigan v. DeFillippo,
443 U.S. 31 (1979), at p. 35, and in New York v. Belton, 453 U.S.
454 (1981), at p. 461.

 

The conclusions that
emerge from this line of authority have been commented on and accepted in
scholarly analysis recognizing that a power of search exists as an incident of
arrest:  Wharton's Criminal Procedure (12th ed. 1984), vol. 1, No. 180,
at pp. 363‑73, and C. H. Whitebread, Criminal Procedure
(1980), at p. 133.  The only controversy in the U.S. concerns the extent of
this power: W. R. LaFave, Search and Seizure (2nd ed. 1987), vol.
2, No. 5.2.

 

However, U.S. law is of
limited assistance since Canadian public law is derived primarily from British
common law, which, in the absence of specific legislation or modification by
our courts, continues to be relevant.

 

Having completed this
review of relevant British and American authorities I now turn to the law as it
has been recognized and developed in Canada.

 

Canadian Case Law and Scholarly Opinion

 

Canadian courts have
sometimes thought it useful to consider the U.S. rule in their analysis of the
power to search a lawfully arrested person:  Gottschalk v. Hutton
(1921), 66 D.L.R. 499 (Alta. S.C., App. Div.); R. v. McDonald (1932), 59
C.C.C. 56 (Alta. S.C., App. Div.); R. v. Morrison (1987), 20 O.A.C. 230
and R. v. Miller (1987), 38 C.C.C. (3d) 252 (Ont. C.A.)  However, the
Canadian courts have more often turned to British common law in this area.

 








Leigh v. Cole, supra, was considered in Canada for the first time in Gordon
v. Denison (1895), 22 O.A.R. 315.  Though dissenting on another point,
MacLennan J.A. noted about Leigh that ""there can be no question of
its correctness"" (p. 327).

 

The British case Leigh
v. Cole was again applied in Canadian case law in Yakimishyn v. Bileski
(1946), 86 C.C.C. 179 (Man. K.B.) which stated (at p. 181): ""It is
well established that when a prisoner is in custody the right to search his
person exists"".  In Yakimishyn, a prisoner was searched when he
arrived at the penitentiary and his money was seized.  The court held that a
creditor of the prisoner had no right to the money.  I note here that in Welch
v. Gilmour (1955), 111 C.C.C. 221 (B.C.S.C.), the principles put forward in
Yakimishyn were approved.

 

The power to search
received additional support in R. v. Brezack (1949), 96 C.C.C. 97 (Ont.
C.A.), a case involving the prosecution of a police officer for assault.  The
accused was arrested for the possession of narcotics.  When the police officer
tried to search inside his mouth he resisted and hit the officer.  Robertson
C.J. wrote (at p. 101):

 

It is
important to observe that the search that was made is justifiable as an
incident of the arrest.  The constable who makes an
arrest has important duties, such as to see that the prisoner does not escape
by reason of being armed, and to see if any evidence of the offence for which
he was arrested is to be found upon him.  A constable may not always find his
suspicions to be justified by the result of a search.  It is sufficient if the
circumstances are such as to justify the search as a reasonable precaution. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

These comments are all the more forceful as
they were made in connection with a considerably more intensive search than
that conducted in the case at bar.

 








The legality of a search
at the time of an arrest was again the subject of a judgment in Laporte v.
Laganière (1972), 18 C.R.N.S. 357 (Que. S.C.)  Hugessen J. noted that the
power to search could not be extended so as to authorize surgery several months
after the arrest to obtain a bullet lodged in the body of the arrested person. 
On the other hand, in Reynen v. Antonenko (1975), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 342
(Alta. S.C.), it was held that, in the circumstances, the right of search
authorized a rectal search of the accused.

 

In R. v. Rao
(1984), 12 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.), Martin J.A. speaking for the court
summarized the Canadian law on this point as follows (at p. 110):

 

At common
law there is no power to search premises without a warrant (or with a warrant
except for stolen goods) save as incident to lawful arrest.  After making a
lawful arrest, an officer has the right to search the person arrested and take
from his person any property which he reasonably believes is connected with the
offence charged, or which may be used as evidence against the person arrested
on the charge, or any weapon or instrument that might enable the arrested
person to commit an act of violence or effect his escape . . . .  The power
to search the person of the arrestee has generally been considered to extend to
the premises where he is arrested and which are under his control . . . . 
Thus, where a person has been arrested in his house, it seems that his house
may be searched for evidence of the crime with which he is charged . . .
[Emphasis added ‑‑ references omitted.]

 

Though that case involved the power to
search the premises where the arrest was made, which is not the case here,
these comments are relevant in so far as they discuss the existence of the
right to search a lawfully arrested person.

 

The power to search has
also been recognized in R. v. Rousseau, [1985] R.L. 108 (C.S.P.)  In R.
v. Lerke (1986), 43 Alta. L.R. (2d) 1, the Alberta Court of Appeal extended
this right to cover arrests carried out by ordinary citizens.  In Morrison,
supra, a woman was arrested for theft, and when she arrived at the
police station she was asked to remove her clothing so that a search could be
made.  As she was removing her clothing a quantity of narcotics fell out, which
resulted in a charge of possession.  The police argued that the strip search
was necessary to locate all the money reported as stolen.  Dubin J.A., speaking
for the Ontario Court of Appeal, wrote (at p. 232):








At common law, as
incident to a lawful arrest, an officer has the right to search the person
arrested.  The proposition is an old one and has
never been seriously challenged.

 

                                                                                                                                                       .
. .

 

With
respect, the right of a peace officer to search the person under arrest with a
view of determining whether that person has on his or her person any property
which may be connected to the offence charged or any weapon is not dependent
upon his belief that the person arrested has in fact such property or weapons
on his or her person.  [Emphasis added.]

 

And at p. 233:

 

As
incident to a lawful arrest, a peace officer has the right to search the person
arrested and take from his person any property which he reasonably believes is
connected with the offence charged, or may be used as evidence against the
person arrested, or any weapon or instrument found upon the person arrested,
but he need not have reasonable grounds to believe that either such weapons
or evidence will be found.  It is the fact that the search of the person is
made as incident to a lawful arrest which gives the peace officer the authority
to search the person arrested.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Morrison rejected in the clearest possible terms the theory that reasonable
grounds are a prerequisite to the existence of the power to search a lawfully
arrested person.  This case was recently applied by the Ontario Court of Appeal
in Miller, supra.

 

To conclude this review
of Canadian case law, two recent judgments of this Court have discussed in obiter
the power of search.  In R. v. Beare, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387, at
pp. 403-4, La Forest J. alluded to the power to fingerprint a lawfully
arrested person:

 

It should be observed that
the common law permitted a number of other, in my view more serious, intrusions
on the dignity of an individual or persons in custody in the interest of law
enforcement.  As an incident to a lawful arrest, a peace officer has a right to
search the person arrested and to take any property the officer reasonably
believes is connected with the offence charged, or any weapon found upon such
person; see R. v. Morrison (1987), 20 O.A.C. 230.  This authority is
based on the need to disarm an accused and to discover evidence.  In the course
of custodial arrest an accused may be stripped.

 








Also, in R. v. Debot, [1989] 2 S.C.R.
1140, Lamer J. assumed that ""[t]he right to search incident to arrest
derives from the fact of arrest or detention of the person"" (p. 1146).

 

Turning to consider
writings in the area, P. Béliveau, J. Bellemare and J.‑P. Lussier, On
Criminal Procedure (1982), simply indicate that ""[a]t common law, one
may, during a legal arrest, seize the product of the crime or anything that may
serve as evidence.  The person being arrested may also be searched for
evidence"" (p. 200).  B. P. Archibald, ""The Law of Arrest"",
in V. M. Del Buono, ed., Criminal Procedure in Canada (1982), for
his part, writes (at pp. 157-58):

 

It is
generally accepted that there is no common law right to search automatically a
person who has been arrested and the Criminal Code  makes no mention of
such authority.  On the other hand, the common law has consistently allowed
searches of the person incident to arrest where the arresting person has
reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect may have concealed upon his
person articles which may afford evidence with respect to an offence, weapons,
or other objects which may enable the suspect to commit acts of violence or
effect an escape.

 

This view is difficult to reconcile with the
precedents discussed earlier.  Though they recognize limits on the power to
search, Canadian courts do not generally require the existence of reasonable
grounds as a prerequisite to the exercise of this power.  Moreover, as L.
Paikin notes, ""The Standard of ""Reasonableness"" in the Law of
Search and Seizure"", in Criminal Procedure in Canada, op. cit., at
p. 111:

 

Canadian
jurisprudence, while citing and adhering in principle to English authorities,
has been deferential in practice to police interests in this regard.  No modern
reported Canadian case has invalidated a search performed incidental to arrest,
although in one instance the attempted seizure of a prisoner's property
unconnected to the offence has been held to be wrongful.

 

For his part, W. McCalla,
Search and Seizure in Canada (1984), at pp. 128-29, notes:

 








The power to search
incidental to arrest is firmly established at common law.  It was never based on any express or specific authority other
than the view that the power was a natural or assumed adjunct to the officer's
control over the suspect.  This has been attributed in part to the traditional
tolerance of intrusive acts upon the person of an arrested individual.

 

In both
Anglo-Canadian and American jurisdictions, the power to search incidental to
arrest is the largest exception to traditional warrant requirements, whether
imposed constitutionally, or as a matter of judicial or legislative reference. 
The most important justification for the power is the need to prevent suspects
from destroying evidence, committing violence, or attempting to escape. 
Nevertheless, it is not always clear that courts do not see the power as an
automatic right following arrest, or rather one that is only justified by
additional circumstances.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Finally, according to
Hon. R. E. Salhany, The Police Manual of Arrest, Seizure and
Interrogation (3rd ed. 1986), at pp. 60-61:

 

Nor is there recognized under Canadian law or
the common law of England the right to search automatically someone who has
been arrested.  The right to search someone is permitted only as an incident to
an arrest.  The purpose must be to locate further evidence relating to the
charge upon which he has been arrested or to locate any item which might assist
the accused to escape from custody (such as a gun or a knife) or permit him to
cause any violence . . . . 

 

In other
words, the police have no right to search a person merely because that person
has been arrested for a criminal offence.  The search must have a purpose and
such purpose must be founded upon a belief based on reasonable and probable
grounds.

 








In general, despite
certain comments in scholarly discussion, it seems beyond question that the
common law as recognized and developed in Canada holds that the police have a
power to search a lawfully arrested person and to seize anything in his or her
possession or immediate surroundings to guarantee the safety of the police and
the accused, prevent the prisoner's escape or provide evidence against him. 
The common thread in this line of authority is the objective of guaranteeing
safety and applying the law effectively.  While the existence of the power is
accepted, there seems to be some uncertainty as to its scope.  While at common
law the British courts did not impose reasonable grounds as a prerequisite to
the power to search a person lawfully arrested, neither have they gone so far
as to recognize a power to search as a simple corollary of arrest.  The
Canadian courts on the other hand do not seem to have hesitated in adopting
this latter approach.

 

Analysis

 

In determining the exact
scope of a police power derived from the common law, this Court often had
recourse to considerations of principle, and the weighing of the competing
interests involved (Eccles v. Bourque, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 739, Dedman v.
The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 2, and R. v. Landry, [1986] 1 S.C.R.
145).  Competing interests are important factors in determining the limits of a
common law power.  When the power in question comes into conflict with
individual freedoms, it is first necessary to decide whether the power falls
within the general scope of the duty of peace officers.  This duty, clearly
identified, must historically have been recognized by the courts as tending to
promote the effective application of the law.  Secondly, the Court must determine
whether an invasion of individual rights is justified.  In this regard, Le Dain
J. in Dedman defined what he meant by ""justifiable use of the
power"" in question (at p. 35):

 

The interference with
liberty must be necessary for the carrying out of the particular police
duty and it must be reasonable, having regard to the nature of the
liberty interfered with and the importance of the public purpose served by the
interference.  [Emphasis added.]

 

It is therefore necessary in this second
stage to determine whether an invasion of individual rights is necessary in
order for the peace officers to perform their duty, and whether such an
invasion is reasonable in light of the public purposes served by effective
control of criminal acts on the one hand and on the other respect for the
liberty and fundamental dignity of individuals.

 

Having stated these
premises, I now turn to considering the power of search at the time of a lawful
arrest.








As we have seen, the
power to search a lawfully arrested person has its roots deep in the common
law.  In fact, at common law the police power of search extended to encompass a
search of the surroundings of the arrest location and the seizure of anything
they found there.  The precedents I have referred to make it unnecessary to
consider this aspect at greater length.  What must be determined, rather, is
the extent to which the competing interests in the context of a lawful arrest
justify a search as an incident of the arrest.

 

In terms of applying the
law, the ultimate purpose of criminal proceedings is to convict those found
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  Our system of criminal justice is based on
the punishment of conduct that is contrary to the fundamental values of
society, as statutorily enshrined in the Criminal Code  and similar
statutes.  That is its primary purpose.  The system depends for its legitimacy
on the safe and effective performance of this function by the police.  In the
context of an arrest, these requirements entail at least two primary considerations. 
First, the process of arrest must be capable of ensuring that those arrested
will come before the court.  An individual who is arrested should not be able
to evade the police before he is released in accordance with the rules of
criminal procedure, otherwise the administration of justice will be brought
into disrepute.  In light of this consideration, a search of the accused for
weapons or other dangerous articles is necessary as an elementary precaution to
preclude the possibility of their use against the police, the nearby public or
the accused himself.  Incidents of this kind are not unknown.  Further, the
process of arrest must ensure that evidence found on the accused and in his
immediate surroundings is preserved.  The effectiveness of the system depends
in part on the ability of peace officers to collect evidence that can be used
in establishing the guilt of a suspect beyond a reasonable doubt.  The
legitimacy of the justice system would be but a mere illusion if the person
arrested were allowed to destroy evidence in his possession at the time of the
arrest.  These interests have been recognized since the courts first considered
the power to search; in Dillon v. O'Brien, supra, at p. 250,
Palles C.B. wrote:








. . . the interest of the
State in the person charged being brought to trial in due course necessarily
extends, as well to the preservation of material evidence of his guilt or
innocence, as to his custody for the purpose of trial.  His custody is of no
value if the law is powerless to prevent the abstraction or destruction of this
evidence, without which a trial would be no more than an empty form.

 

However, while the common
law gives the police the powers necessary for the effective and safe
application of the law, it does not allow them to place themselves above the
law and use their powers to intimidate citizens.  This is where the protection
of privacy and of individual freedoms becomes very important.

 

For centuries the common
law has spearheaded the protection of individual freedoms.  The concept that a
person and his home are inviolable has been gradually set up in the face of the
potential abuse of power by the State.  In the early seventeenth century the
common law had already held ""[t]hat the house of everyone is to him as his
castle and fortress"" (Semayne's Case (1604), 5 Co. Rep. 91a, 77
E.R. 194).  Similarly, an invisible ""fortress"" was built bit by bit
around each subject of the Empire and gradually any interference with
individual freedom was seen as prima facie unlawful, the representatives
of the State having the burden of establishing a legal basis for their actions:
""no member of the executive can interfere with the liberty or property of
a British subject except on the condition that he can support the legality of
his action before a court of justice"" (Eleko v. Officer Administering
the Government of Nigeria, [1931] A.C. 662 (P.C.), at p. 670).  This
fundamental role of guardian of freedom and property continued and expanded
with the advent of the Charter  (R. v. Morgentaler, [1988] 1
S.C.R. 30, at p. 164, per Wilson J.): ""Thus, the rights guaranteed
in the Charter  erect around each individual, metaphorically speaking, an
invisible fence over which the state will not be allowed to trespass.  The role
of the courts is to map out, piece by piece, the parameters of the fence"".

 








Though the parties have
not relied on the Charter , and have simply referred to the common law
sources in examining the scope of the power to search, I feel that the courts
should ""apply and develop the principles of the common law in a manner
consistent with the fundamental values enshrined in the Constitution"" (RWDSU
v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573, at p. 603).  In this
regard this Court has held that, consistent with the values contained in the Charter ,
a search will not be wrongful if it is authorized by law, if the law is itself
reasonable and if the search is conducted in a reasonable manner (R. v.
Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 278; and R. v. Debot, supra,
at p. 1148, per Lamer J., and at p. 1160, per Wilson
J.)  The concept of freedom as traditionally safeguarded by the courts has been
reexamined since the Charter  and now generally means the absence of
constraint and coercion.  As Dickson J. (now C.J.) noted in R. v. Big M Drug
Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 336:

 

Freedom
can primarily be characterized by the absence of coercion or constraint.  If a
person is compelled by the state or the will of another to a course of action
or inaction which he would not otherwise have chosen, he is not acting of his
own volition and he cannot be said to be truly free.  One of the major purposes
of the Charter  is to protect, within reason, from compulsion or
restraint.

 

As important and
fundamental as these values may be, they are not absolute.  As the Law Reform
Commission of Canada notes, Our Criminal Procedure (1988), Report 32, at
p. 14:

 

In order
to safeguard freedom it is sometimes necessary to limit it, through
prohibitions.  However, if human dignity, freedom and justice are among the
major values which the criminal law enshrines, we must carefully assess the way
in which the law is enforced in order to ensure that our law and practices
respect and do not undermine these values.

 








As we have seen, the common law gave the
police only such powers as were consistent with the protection of individual
rights.  The courts have always held that a proper balance between these two
fundamental components is vital, as illustrated by the observations of Williams
J. in 1853 in Leigh v. Cole, supra, at pp. 330-31:

 

On one hand, it is clear
that the police ought to be fully protected in the discharge of an onerous,
arduous, and difficult duty -- a duty necessary for the comfort and security of
the community.  On the other hand, it is equally incumbent on every one engaged
in the administration of justice, to take care that the powers necessarily
entrusted to the police are not made an instrument of oppression or of tyranny
towards even the meanest, most depraved, and basest subjects of the realm.

 

In this regard a
""frisk"" search is a relatively non-intrusive procedure: outside
clothing is patted down to determine whether there is anything on the person of
the arrested individual.  Pockets may be examined but the clothing is not
removed and no physical force is applied.  The duration of the search is only a
few seconds.  Though the search, if conducted, is in addition to the arrest,
which generally entails a considerably longer and more sustained loss of
freedom and dignity, a brief search does not constitute, in view of the objectives
sought, a disproportionate interference with the freedom of persons lawfully
arrested.  There exists no less intrusive means of attaining these objectives.

 

A ""frisk""
search incidental to a lawful arrest reconciles the public's interest in the effective
and safe enforcement of the law on the one hand, and on the other its interest
in ensuring the freedom and dignity of individuals.  The minimal intrusion
involved in the search is necessary to ensure that criminal justice is properly
administered.  I agree with the opinion of the Ontario Court of Appeal as
stated in Brezack, Morrison and Miller, supra, that
the existence of reasonable and probable grounds is not a prerequisite to the
existence of a police power to search.  The exercise of this power is not
however unlimited.  Three propositions can be derived from the authorities and
a consideration of the underlying interests.

 








1.  This power does not
impose a duty.  The police have some discretion in conducting the search.  Where
they are satisfied that the law can be effectively and safely applied without a
search, the police may see fit not to conduct a search.  They must be in a
position to assess the circumstances of each case so as to determine whether a
search meets the underlying objectives.

 

2.  The search must be
for a valid objective in pursuit of the ends of criminal justice, such as the
discovery of an object that may be a threat to the safety of the police, the
accused or the public, or that may facilitate escape or act as evidence against
the accused.  The purpose of the search must not be unrelated to the objectives
of the proper administration of justice, which would be the case for example if
the purpose of the search was to intimidate, ridicule or pressure the accused
in order to obtain admissions.

 

3.  The search must not
be conducted in an abusive fashion and in particular, the use of physical or
psychological constraint should be proportionate to the objectives sought and
the other circumstances of the situation.

 

A search which does not
meet these objectives could be characterized as unreasonable and unjustified at
common law.

 

That is the background
against which the Court must examine the facts of this case to determine
whether the ""frisk"" search conducted by the appellants constituted an
assault.  Needless to say, if the search in question is justified at common law
it cannot possibly constitute criminal conduct, more particularly, assault.

 

Application to the Facts of the Case

 








It should be noted that
all the Quebec courts have approached the evidence in this case on the basis
that a ""frisk"" search is not necessarily incidental to a lawful
arrest, but instead, depends on the existence of reasonable grounds.

 

Despite the imposition of
a standard higher than that required at common law, Judge Choquette of the
Court of Summary Proceedings, the only judge to have seen and heard the
witnesses, after considering whether the accused [TRANSLATION] ""had
reasonable grounds to make a search of the complainant"", answered in the
affirmative:

 

[TRANSLATION]  Considering
the circumstances of the case as a whole, the court feels that the police
definitely had reasonable grounds that would justify them in lawfully making
the arrest and search of the complainant, and that in view of the insults
heaped on them by Mr. Cloutier they acted courteously.

 

As regards
the force used to do this, it does not seem excessive or disproportionate in
view of the events.  The accused made a ""frisk"" search of the
complainant using no excessive violence or force.

 

Barrette-Joncas J. of the
Superior Court came to the same conclusion.  Rothman J.A., dissenting in the
Court of Appeal, took a similar view and accepted the trial judge's findings of
fact and the conclusions drawn by him.  The majority of the judges in the Court
of Appeal seem to have taken a stricter approach to the facts.  They concluded,
contrary to the finding of the trial judge, that reasonable and probable
grounds did not exist.

 








Applying the legal
standard to the facts of this case, the evidence indicates that the police
considered that in light of all the circumstances it was necessary to search
the respondent.  The respondent's conduct, which the Court of Appeal judges
characterized as ""unpleasant"" and ""highly agitated and verbally
abusive"", was such as to arouse a concern in the police officers for
safety and effectiveness objectives.  Secondly, the evidence showed to my
satisfaction that the police searched the respondent in pursuit of a valid
objective, here, police safety in making a lawful arrest.  As to this I will
simply cite a passage from the opinion of Rothman J.A. in which he reproduces
this part of the evidence (at p. 1484):

 

Among the reasons that
would justify a personal search is the possibility that the person arrested
might be armed and might endanger the officers arresting him.  In this case,
that was the only justification given by Constable Bédard:

 

[TRANSLATION]

 

Q.  So now,
Constable Bédard, what happened?  You told Mr. Cloutier -- there was an
exchange, which you have just described to the court -- what happened then?

 

A.  Mr.
Cloutier, after being told at least three times, got out of his car and
voluntarily went with us to the radio car; then at that point, we before . . .
putting in anyone who has been arrested, whether for a traffic ticket or
something else, in our radio car -- I don't know this guy, he could be anyone,
he can say he is anything he wants, I don't want to say anything, it is nothing
personal, but he is someone who perhaps may take the law into his own hands
because he hates the police, he may turn on me inside the car, so for my own
safety . . . 

 

Q.  What do
you do?

 

A.  For . . .
we search him.

 

Q.  So, you
search him?

 

A.  We search
him.

 

Q.  Yes . . .

 

A. 
Briefly. . .

 

Looking at
the matter now, it would not be difficult to conclude that the police officers
did not have any real reason to fear physical violence from Mr. Cloutier.  But,
on the evidence, it is clear that he was highly agitated and verbally abusive. 
The conclusion of the trial judge that it was Cloutier's conduct that made the
situation as tense as it became is amply supported by the evidence.

 

Third, as to the way in which the search was
conducted, as already noted, it is not disputed that in the circumstances, the
police did not use either excessive force or constraint.








Furthermore, the fact
that there existed a general directive in the police department to search an
arrested suspect for any weapon or object potentially dangerous to the
policemen has no bearing on this case, since the evidence of the police
officers who conducted the search was that they exercised their independent
discretion taking into account all the circumstances of this case.

 

I accordingly consider
that, as an incident to the lawful arrest of the respondent, the frisk search
was justified, and accordingly Judge Choquette made no error in dismissing the
informations for assault brought against the appellants.  This is sufficient to
dispose of the appeal.

 

Costs

 

On the question of costs,
the Summary Convictions Court may in its discretion order the payment of the
defendant's costs against the informant when the information is dismissed (s.
744  of the Criminal Code ).  In the case at bar none of the Quebec courts
applied this provision.  Therefore each party paid its own costs in the lower
courts.  The appellants did not argue strongly on this point.  In the
circumstances, I feel it is proper not to award costs.

 

Conclusion

costs in any court.

attention and merits some comment.  This is the ground dealing with the Court
of Appeal's refusal to admit new evidence.  Although the Court of Appeal
correctly stated the test established by this Court in Palmer v. The Queen,
[1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, regarding the admission of fresh evidence, and in
particular the criterion that it must be likely to affect the result of the
case, it erred in applying this test to the present case when it dismissed the
application solely on the ground that the evidence in question would neither confirm
nor corroborate the appellant's testimony.  It does not necessarily follow that
the evidence could not nevertheless have an impact on the verdict.  We are of
the view, however, that given the evidence already in the record, the fresh
evidence could not in fact have affected the result.

    The
appellant was the owner of a vessel alleged to have been used by him to carry
out a scheme to import narcotics into Canada.  He contacted a person who,
unknown to him, was a police informer, and asked him if he would like to invest
in the scheme.  The informer had further conversations with the appellant while
wearing a ""body pack"" which transmitted the conversations to the
police who simultaneously recorded them.  In one taped conversation, the
appellant told the informer how the narcotics were obtained, transported and
hidden upon his reaching British Columbia.  The police conducted searches of
the appellant's vessel but found no narcotics and no evidence to support the
appellant's detailed account of the scheme.  Appellant was convicted of
conspiring to import a narcotic contrary to s. 423(1) (d) of the Criminal
Code .  The British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed appellant's
appeal.

 

    This
appeal was primarily concerned with the protection accorded by s. 8  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  against electronic recording of the
conversations of individuals with the police and informers in the absence of
judicial authorization.  Four constitutional questions were stated.  The first
and third queried whether or not s. 178.11(2) (a) and
s. 178.16(1) (b) infringed s. 8  of the Charter  and the
second and fourth queried whether such infringement, if found, was justifiable
under s. 1  of the Charter .  A number of subsidiary issues were
raised:  (1) whether the Court of Appeal properly refused to allow the
introduction of fresh evidence; (2) whether the trial judge should have put the
defence theory to the jury; and, (3) whether certain evidence was admissible.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.  Section 178.11(2)(a) of the Code does
not infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 8  of the Charter , but
the interception of private communications by an instrumentality of the state
with the consent of the originator or intended recipient thereof, without prior
judicial authorization, does infringe the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s.
8 .  Section 178.16(1)(b) of the Code does not infringe
or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 8  of the Charter .  It
was not necessary to answer the second and fourth constitutional questions.

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Sopinka, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ.  For
the reasons given in R. v. Duarte, [1990] 1 S.C.R.
000, the participant electronic surveillance conducted here by the police and
their informer infringed the right to be secure against unreasonable search and
seizure guaranteed by s. 8  of the Charter  and was
not saved by s. 1  of the Charter .  The appellant
did not discharge the onus of establishing that the admission of the recordings
of the intercepted communications would bring the administration of justice
into disrepute.  The evidence, therefore, needed not be excluded.

 

    The
Court of Appeal correctly dealt with the subsidiary issues.

 

    Per Lamer
J.:  The appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given in R. v.
Duarte, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 000.

    The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Sopinka, Gonthier and
McLachlin JJ. was delivered by

 

    LA FOREST J. --
Though there are subsidiary issues, the principal issue in this appeal is the
same as that raised in the companion case of R. v. Duarte, [1990]
1 S.C.R. 000.  In short, this appeal is concerned with the protection accorded
by s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  against
electronic recording of the conversations of individuals with the police and
informers in the absence of judicial authorization.

 

Facts

 

    The
appellant, Lewis Anthony Wiggins, was the owner of a vessel, the Beaufort
Spirit, which the Crown alleged was used by him in the
execution of a scheme for the importation of narcotics into Canada.  Evidence
at trial showed that the appellant had contacted a person by the name of Mr.
Seed, who, unknown to the appellant, was a police informer, and asked him if he
would like to invest in the scheme.  The informer told police about this
conversation and, at their request, had further conversations with the
appellant while wearing a ""body pack"", i.e., an electromagnetic
transmitter, which transmitted the conversations to the police who
simultaneously recorded them.  The informer was given ""seed money"" by
the police which he, in turn, gave to the appellant as an
""investment"" in the scheme.  In one taped conversation, the appellant
told the informer how the narcotics were obtained, that they were welded into
the hull of the vessel, and how they were transported and hidden upon his
reaching British Columbia.  The police conducted searches of the appellant's
vessel but found no narcotics and no evidence to support the appellant's
detailed account of how the narcotics had been hidden in British Columbia.

 

    At
the conclusion of the trial, counsel for the appellant explained to the jury
the defence theory that the appellant was lying to the informer about the
narcotics being welded into the hull of the vessel and about the manner in
which it had been hidden.  The appellant did not testify.  The trial judge gave
his charge to the jury on the same day the defence made its submissions.  He
indicated that he would not repeat the theories of the parties as they had been
well covered by the parties' counsel.  The appellant was convicted of
conspiring to import a narcotic contrary to s. 423(1)(d) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.

 

    The
appellant then appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal.  He first
sought to introduce fresh evidence, but this request was refused on the basis
of the principles enunciated in Palmer and Palmer v. The Queen, [1980]
1 S.C.R. 759.

 

    The
appellant's various grounds of appeal were similarly rejected.  The first -‑
that the trial judge erred in failing to put the theory of the defence to the
jury -‑ failed because the court found this to be one of those rare cases
recognized in Azoulay v. The Queen, [1952] 2 S.C.R.
495, where it was not necessary for the judge to do so.  The second issue -‑
whether the trial judge erred in admitting the appellant's passport into
evidence on the ground that a passport deposited with the police under the
terms of his judicial interim release does not become available as evidence -‑
was disposed of on the simple ground that it was too late to raise the
objection.

 

    The
third ground of appeal was that the appellant's privacy was invaded by the
recording of his conversations with the informer.  The court cited with
approval the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.
Sanelli (1987), 60 C.R. (3d) 142, in which it was held that s.
178.11(2) (a) of the Criminal Code  did not
contravene s. 8  of the Charter  and that there was no
""reasonable expectation of privacy in the course of a conversation where
one party to it has consented to it being intercepted and recorded"".  The
court noted that the law does not require that ""when the police are aware
that someone is about to divulge a private matter to another they must seek
judicial authorization before that other person may listen to what is said or
secretly record what is said"".  The court also rejected this ground of
appeal.

 

    On
the appeal to this Court, the same issues were raised but the appellant in
addition argued that the Crown had suppressed evidence of the vessel's
stability information booklet which, it was alleged, would support the
appellant's case.

 

Analysis
and Disposition

 

    I
shall deal first with the issue related to the interception of private
communications by the police through the informer, about which the following
constitutional questions were stated:

 

    1.Does s. 178.11(2)(a) of the Criminal
Code , legalizing the interception of private communications
with the consent of the originator or intended recipient thereof, without the
need for judicial authorization, infringe or deny the rights and freedoms
guaranteed by s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

    2.If s. 178.11(2)(a) of the Criminal
Code  does infringe or deny the rights and freedoms
guaranteed by s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , is it
justified by s. 1  of the Charter  and therefore not inconsistent with
the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    3.Does s. 178.16(1)(b) of the Criminal
Code , making admissible as evidence an intercepted private
communication, where the interception was not lawfully made, with the express
consent to the admission thereof of the originator or intended recipient thereof,
infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 8  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

    4.If
s. 178.16(1)(b) of the Criminal Code  does
infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 8  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , is it justified by s. 1  of the Charter  and
therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    For
the reasons given in R. v. Duarte, supra, I am
of the view that the participant electronic surveillance conducted by the
police and an informer in this case infringes the right to be secure against
unreasonable searches and seizure guaranteed by s. 8  of the Charter  and is
not saved by s. 1  of the Charter .  However, for reasons also given in R. v.
Duarte, I do not think the appellant has discharged the onus
of establishing that the admission of the recordings of the intercepted
communications in the present case would bring the administration of justice
into disrepute.  This evidence should not, therefore, be excluded.  Indeed,
this point is even stronger here than in R. v. Duarte, for
the case for the appellant did not deny that the intercepted statements were
made.  His defence was simply that he was lying, a defence the jury obviously
did not accept.

 

    For
the reasons given in R. v. Duarte, the issue of the
constitutional validity of ss. 178.11(2)(a) and
178.16(1)(b) is not engaged in the manner in which counsel framed
the issue.

 

    As
to the other issues, it is sufficient to say that, in my view, those raised
before the Court of Appeal were correctly disposed of by that court, and that
there is no merit to the point concerning the alleged suppression of evidence.

 

    I
would dismiss the appeal.  I would reply to the constitutional questions as
follows:

 

    1.Does
s. 178.11(2)(a) of the Criminal Code ,
legalizing the interception of private communications with the consent of the
originator or intended recipient thereof, without the need for judicial
authorization, infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 8  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Section 178.11(2)(a) of the Code does
not infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 8  of the Charter , but
the interception of private communications by an instrumentality of the state
with the consent of the originator or intended recipient thereof, without prior
judicial authorization, does infringe the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s.
8 .

 

    2.If
s. 178.11(2)(a) of the Criminal Code  does
infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 8  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , is it justified by s. 1  of the Charter  and
therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

It is not necessary to answer this question.

 

    3.Does
s. 178.16(1)(b) of the Criminal Code , making
admissible as evidence an intercepted private communication, where the
interception was not lawfully made, with the express consent to the admission
thereof of the originator or intended recipient thereof, infringe or deny the
rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Section 178.16(1)(b) of the Code does
not infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 8  of the Charter .

 

    4.If
s. 178.16(1)(b) of the Criminal Code  does
infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 8  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , is it justified by s. 1  of the Charter  and
therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    It
is not necessary to answer this question.

    As
part of an investigation into drug trafficking, the police rented an apartment
for a police informer who was working with an undercover police officer.  The
apartment was equipped with audio‑visual recording equipment installed in
a wall.  Prior to the installation of the equipment, the informer and the
undercover officer consented to the interception of their conversations,
pursuant to the provisions of s. 178.11(2) (a) of the Criminal
Code .  Appellant discussed a cocaine transaction with the
undercover officer and the informer at the apartment.  The undercover officer
made notes of these and a subsequent conversation based upon a review of the
tapes of the conversations.

 

    The
appellant was later charged with conspiracy to import a narcotic.  At trial, he
challenged, on a voir dire, the validity of s. 178.11(2)(a) of the Code which
excepts the interception of conversations to which one of the parties consents
from the prohibition of unauthorized electronic surveillance.  The trial judge
held that the actions of the authorities infringed the appellant's rights to be
secure from unreasonable search and seizure under s. 8  of the Charter  and
that the evidence thereby obtained was held not admissible.  The Crown appealed
to the Ontario Court of Appeal which unanimously allowed the appeal, set aside
the acquittal and ordered a new trial.

 

    The
constitutional questions stated in this Court queried whether s. 178.11(2) (a) of the Criminal
Code  infringed or denied the rights and freedoms guaranteed
by s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and if
so, whether or not it was justified by s. 1  of the Charter . 
During argument, the position was advanced that the constitutionality of s.
178.11(2) (a) might not really arise in that this provision was
really an exception to the criminal prohibition against the interception of
private communications set forth in s. 178.11(1) .  Action contemplated by that
exception could not be made criminal by a Charter  attack
on its validity.  The real question, then, became whether, even though such
action may not constitute a criminal offence, it would nonetheless, when
undertaken by an instrumentality of the state, such as the police, violate s. 8 
of the Charter .  Finally, if this action was indeed an unjustifiable
infringement of a Charter  right, were communications
intercepted as a result of this practice admissible under s. 24(2)  of the Charter ?

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.  Section 178.11(2) (a) of the Criminal
Code , does not infringe or deny the rights and freedoms
guaranteed by s. 8  of the Charter , but the interception of private
communications by an instrumentality of the state with the consent of the
originator or intended recipient thereof, without prior judicial authorization,
does infringe the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 8 .  It was not necessary
to answer the second question.

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé, Sopinka, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ.: 
Surreptitious electronic surveillance of the individual by an agency of the
state constitutes an unreasonable search or seizure under s. 8  of the Charter .

 

    The
regulation of electronic surveillance is not directed at protecting a person
from the risk that someone will repeat his words but from the much more
insidious danger inherent in allowing the state, in its unfettered discretion,
to record and transmit his words.  If the state were free, at its sole
discretion, to make permanent electronic recordings of a person's private
communications, there would be no meaningful residuum to the right to live free
from surveillance.  A reasonable balance must therefore be struck between the
right of individuals to be left alone and the right of the state to intrude on
privacy in the furtherance of its responsibilities for law enforcement.

 

    Part
IV.1 of the Code strikes an appropriate balance.  It
meets the high standard of the Charter  which guarantees
the right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure by subjecting
the power of the state to record private communications to external restraint
and requiring that action to be justified by application of an objective
criterion.  The imposition of an external and objective criterion affords a
measure of protection to any citizen whose private communications have been
intercepted.

 

    Privacy
may be defined as the right of the individual to determine when, how, and to
what extent he or she will release personal information.  A reasonable
expectation of privacy demands that an individual may proceed on the assumption
that the state may only violate this right by recording private communications
on a clandestine basis when it has established to the satisfaction of a
detached judicial officer that an offence has been or is being committed and
that interception of private communications stands to afford evidence of the
offence.

 

    The
assessment of the constitutionality of a search and seizure must focus on its
`reasonable' or `unreasonable' impact on the subject of the search or the
seizure, and not simply on its rationality in furthering some valid government
objective.  Applying this standard, if the surreptitious recording of private
communications is a search and seizure within the meaning of s. 8  of the Charter , it is
because the law recognizes that a person's privacy is intruded on in an
unreasonable manner whenever the state, without a prior showing of reasonable
cause before a neutral judicial officer, arrogates to itself the right
surreptitiously to record communications that the originator expects
will not be intercepted by anyone other than the person intended by its
originator to receive them.

 

    By
contrast to the general provisions on electronic surveillance, the Code places
no restriction on participant surveillance, i.e., where one of the parties to
the conversation consents.  The police may employ this practice in their
absolute discretion, against whom they wish and for whatever reasons they wish,
without any limit as to place or duration.  There is a total absence of prior
judicial supervision of this practice.

 

    There
is no logical distinction between third party electronic surveillance and
participant surveillance.  Where persons have reasonable grounds to believe
their communications are private communications, the unauthorized
surreptitious electronic recording of those communications is an intrusion on a
reasonable expectation of privacy.  Our perception that we are protected
against arbitrary interceptions of private communications ceases to have any
real basis once it is accepted that the state is free to record private
communications, without constraint, provided only that it has secured the
agreement of one of the parties to the communication.  The risk of being
recorded is not simply a variant of the risk of having one's words disclosed by
the person to whom we speak.  Surreptitious electronic recording annihilates
the very important right to choose the range of our listeners.

 

    Whether
or not to allow participant surveillance is a policy decision fraught with the
gravest of implications.  Countenancing participant surveillance, strikes not
only at the expectations of privacy of criminals but also undermines the
expectations of privacy of all those who set store on the right to live in
reasonable security and freedom from surveillance, be it electronic or
otherwise.  It has long been recognized that this freedom not to be compelled
to share our confidences with others is the very hallmark of a free society. 
The sole effect of requiring a warrant would be to ensure that police restrict
""participant monitoring"" to cases where they can show probable cause
for a warrant.  It would not hamper their ability to combat crime effectively.

 

    Participant
surveillance infringes s. 8  of the Charter .  It leaves all
the conditions under which conversations are intercepted to the sole discretion
of the police and therefore cannot be held to meet the definition of
""reasonable"" in the context of s. 8  of the Charter .  Its
large‑scale use by police could by‑pass any judicial consideration
of the entire police procedures and make the entire scheme in Part IV.1 of the Code largely
irrelevant.  Indeed, the constitutionality of Part IV.1 of the Code is
predicated on the numerous safeguards designed to prevent the possibility that
the police view recourse to electronic surveillance as a routine administrative
matter.

 

    The
simple fact that the police could employ the same investigatory tool with or
without a warrant destroys any argument that participant surveillance can be
upheld as a reasonable limit to the right to be secure from unreasonable search
and seizure.

 

    Section
178.16(1) of the Code makes certain types of evidence inadmissible. 
It does not make a communication admissible.  If it is admissible, it is by
virtue of the common law.  The communication would be admissible as relevant
evidence at common law, but since it was obtained contrary to s. 8 , it will
not, by virtue of s. 24(2)  of the Charter , be admissible if
to do so would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  Many
factors can be considered in determining if the administration of justice will
be brought into disrepute.  Of cardinal importance in assessing these factors
is the fairness of the process, and in particular, its impact on the fairness
of the trial.

 

    The
breach here infringed an important Charter  right and the
evidence could have been obtained without breaching the Charter .  It
was, however, in no way deliberate and it stemmed from an entirely reasonable
misunderstanding of the law by the police officers who would otherwise have
obtained the necessary evidence to convict the accused in any event.  The
admission of this evidence would not bring the administration of the law into
disrepute.

 

    Per Lamer
J.:  The appeal should be dismissed for the reasons of the Ontario Court of
Appeal.  It was consequently unnecessary to address the issue of whether the
evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms .

judgment of Dickson C.J. and La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Sopinka, Gonthier and

    LA FOREST J. --
This appeal is concerned with the protection accorded by s. 8  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  against electronic recording of the
conversations of individuals with the police and informers in the absence of
judicial authorization.

 

Facts

 

    As
part of an investigation into drug trafficking, the Ontario Provincial Police
and the Metropolitan Toronto Police rented an apartment in Mississauga which
was to be occupied by a police informer who was working with an undercover
police officer.  The apartment was equipped with audio-visual recording
equipment installed in a wall.  Prior to the installation of the equipment, the
informer and the undercover officer consented to the interception of their
conversations, pursuant to the provisions of s. 178.11(2)(a) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  As a result of the operation,
the undercover officer met a man named Paul Vidotto.  Some days after the
meeting, Vidotto, the appellant Mario Duarte, and two others attended at the
apartment and discussed a cocaine transaction with the undercover officer and
the informer.  The undercover officer made notes of these and a subsequent
conversation which he acknowledged were based upon a review of the tapes of the
conversations.

 

    The
appellant was later charged with the offence of conspiracy to import a
narcotic.  At trial, he challenged, on a voir dire, the
validity of s. 178.11(2)(a) of the Code which excepts from
the prohibition of unauthorized electronic surveillance, the interception of
conversations to which one of the parties consents.  The trial judge, Trotter
J., held that the actions of the authorities infringed the appellant's rights
to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure under s. 8  of the Charter  and
that the evidence thereby obtained was held not admissible.

 

    The
Crown appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal which unanimously allowed the
appeal, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial.  In reasons that I
shall review later, Cory J.A. (as he then was) following American authorities
dealing with the Fourth Amendment to the American Constitution, concluded that
the interception of private conversations without a warrant but with the
consent of one of the participants does not violate s. 8  of the Charter 
((1987), 61 O.R. (2d) 385).

 

    Notice
of Appeal was then filed in this Court and the following constitutional
questions were stated:

 

1.Does section 178.11(2)(a) of the Criminal
Code , legalizing the interception of private communications
with the consent of the originator or intended recipient thereof, without the
need for judicial authorization, infringe or deny the rights and freedoms
guaranteed by s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If
section 178.11(2)(a) of the Criminal Code  does
infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 8  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , is it justified by s. 1  of the Charter  and
therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

The
Attorneys General for Ontario and Quebec intervened to support the
constitutionality of s. 178.11(2)(a).

 

    During
the argument, counsel for the appellant, however, advanced the position that
the constitutionality of s. 178.11(2)(a) might
not really arise.  That provision, he noted, was really an exception to the
criminal prohibition against the interception of private communications set
forth in s. 178.11(1), an exception applicable both to the police and members
of the public.  Action contemplated by that exception could not be made criminal
by a Charter  attack on its validity.  The real question, then,
becomes whether, even though such action may not constitute a criminal offence,
it would nonetheless, when undertaken by an instrumentality of the state, such
as the police, violate s. 8  of the Charter .  In my view, that
is the correct approach to the matter and I shall deal with it on this basis.

 

The
Issues

 

    The
principal issue in this appeal is whether the commonly styled
""consent"" or ""participant"" surveillance ‑- i.e.,
electronic surveillance in which one of the parties to a conversation, usually
an undercover police officer or a police informer, surreptitiously records it ‑-
infringes the right under s. 8  of the Charter  to be
secure against unreasonable search and seizure.  This raises the subsidiary
issues of whether such infringement is justifiable under s. 1  of the Charter  and
whether the recorded conversation can nonetheless be admitted into evidence
against an accused.  I should at the outset note that ""consent
surveillance"" is an unhappy term to describe a practice where only one
party to a conversation has agreed to have it recorded.  As put by the United
States Supreme Court in Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347
(1967), at p. 358:  ""the very nature of electronic surveillance precludes
its use pursuant to the suspect's consent.""  I shall, therefore, use the
term ""participant surveillance"".

 

    The
importance of the issues can hardly be gainsaid.  Carr, The Law of
Electronic Surveillance, points out, at pp. 3-61, that in the United States
this mode of surveillance is without question ""the most widely used and
most frequently practiced [sic] mode of eavesdropping"".  Though I have found no
data on the relative frequency of this practice in Canada, the cases would
indicate that it is also widespread here.  The extensive use of electronic
surveillance in this country is documented.  The Law Reform Commission of
Canada's working paper on Electronic Surveillance reports at p. 10
that on a relative basis, Canadian law enforcement authorities request twenty
times more authorizations to conduct electronic surveillance than their
American counterparts.

 

    Canada,
in common with the United States, has taken important steps to ensure judicial
supervision of electronic surveillance by Part IV.1 of the Criminal
Code .  Section 178.11(1)  makes it an offence to engage in
this activity.  It reads:

 

    178.11  (1)
Every one who, by means of an electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other
device, wilfully intercepts a private communication is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to imprisonment for five years.

 

Under
Part IV.1, the police generally may only conduct electronic surveillance once
in possession of an authorization issued by a superior court judge and are
bound to conduct such surveillance in strict accordance with the terms and
conditions of the authorization.  By contrast, participant surveillance is left
entirely to the discretion of the police.  Section 178.11(2)(a) of the Code
provides the following exception to s. 178.11(1):

 

    178.11  ...

 

    (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to

 

(a) a
person who has the consent to intercept, express or implied, of the originator
of the private communication or of the person intended by the originator
thereof to receive it;

 

The
police are thus free to make the decision to conduct this type of surveillance
on whom they wish, where they wish, and for as long as they wish (in the
present case, for example, the operation lasted some two years).

 

The Risk
Analysis of the Court of Appeal

 

    In
upholding the legality of participant surveillance, the Court of Appeal relied
heavily on American authorities, citing several decisions of that country's
Supreme Court, notably United States v. White, 401 U.S. 745
(1971), a plurality decision which has been interpreted as giving that court's imprimatur to the
practice, though the specific legislative provisions authorizing it were not
directly placed in issue; see Carr, op. cit., at pp. 3-62.  Cory J.A., at p.
390, accurately summarized the logic of those decisions as resting on the
notion that ""the consent to the interception by the recipient may be
looked upon as no more than an extension of the powers of recollection of the
recipient of the communication"".  In essence, the starting point for the
analysis is the proposition that the person who divulges any confidence always
runs the risk that his interlocutor will betray the confidence.  As Cory J.A.
put it, at p. 393:  ""The expression of the idea and the assumption of the
risk of disclosure are therefore concomitant.""

 

    The
argument is then developed by pointing out that disclosures of this nature have
always been admissible in a court of law.  It is but a small step to the
conclusion that constitutional expectations of privacy would therefore not
operate to prohibit the interception of conversations which one of the participants
is surreptitiously recording.  As Cory J.A. put it, at pp. 393-94:

 

    Given
that it is accepted that the informant may testify in this manner as to
pertinent conversations, the admission of electronic recordings of those
conversations would seem to be a reasonable, logical and sequential step in
trial proceedings.  In this regard, the accurate transcript of the conversation
should so often benefit the accused as the informant.

 

    The
same point, but with an added twist, was made by the Supreme Court of the
United States in the following passage in Lopez v. United
States, 373 U.S. 427 (1963), at pp. 438-39:

 

    Once it is plain that Davis could properly testify
about his conversation with Lopez, the constitutional claim relating to the
recording of that conversation emerges in proper perspective.

 

                                                                           ...

 

    Stripped
to its essentials, petitioner's argument amounts to saying that he has a
constitutional right to rely on possible flaws in the agent's memory, or to
challenge the agent's credibility without being beset by corroborating evidence
that is not susceptible of impeachment.  For no other argument can justify
excluding an accurate version of a conversation that the agent could testify to
from memory.  We think the risk that petitioner took in offering a bribe to
Davis fairly included the risk that the offer would be accurately reproduced in
court, whether by faultless memory or mechanical recording.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    The
decision in Lopez v. United States proceeds on the
basis that participant surveillance is inherently less offensive than third
party surveillance because the agent of the state hears nothing that his
interlocutor did not intend him to hear.  As the court there put it, at p. 439:

 

... the
device was used only to obtain the most reliable evidence possible of a
conversation in which the Government's own agent was a participant and which
that agent was fully entitled to disclose.  And the device was not planted by
means of an unlawful physical invasion of petitioner's premises under
circumstances which would violate the Fourth Amendment.  It was carried in and
out by an agent who was there with petitioner's assent, and it neither saw nor
heard more than the agent himself.

 

    Thus,
for the Court of Appeal, inasmuch as the police are subjected to no warrant
requirement in their use of informers or in their efforts to insinuate
themselves into the confidence of a suspect, the use of electronic
surveillance, as an adjunct to that process, is of no constitutional
significance.  In other words, if there has been a violation of privacy on the
part of the state, it is complete when the confidence of the person under
suspicion is gained.  The Charter  cannot purport to protect us if we
don't know how to choose our ""friends"".

 

    In
summary, the risk analysis that is at the heart of the Court of Appeal's
judgment rejects the notion that any distinction grounded on constitutional
concerns should be drawn between evidence gained through the testimony of a
participant to a conversation, and evidence gained through a surreptitious
electronic recording of that conversation.  A person who has voluntarily chosen
to confide his wrongdoing to another, and who, by happenstance, has had the
misfortune (from his perspective) of doing so in the presence of a microphone,
should not be able to invoke the Charter  to prevent
divulgation of the confidence in a court of law.  Incriminating statements and
confessions of wrongdoing are not per se constitutionally
protected communications; provided the accused spoke of his own free will,
there is no constitutional significance to be accorded the manner in which the
evidence was gained.  In effect, the court chose to treat the risk that an
interlocutor will divulge one's words and the risk that he will make a
permanent electronic record of them at the behest of the state as being of the
same order of magnitude.

 

    This
argument is not without weight:  the fact that it counts among its adherents
the Supreme Court of the United States and many state appellate courts
testifies to that.

 

The
Opposing Approach

 

    With
respect, it seems to me, the Court of Appeal failed to deal with the true issue
raised in this appeal.  The real question, as I see it, is whether our
constitutional right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure
should be seen as imposing on the police the obligation to seek prior judicial
authorization before engaging in participant surveillance, or whether the
police should be entirely free to determine whether circumstances justify
recourse to participant surveillance and, having so determined, be allowed an
unlimited discretion in defining the scope and duration of participant
surveillance.  This Court is accordingly called on to decide whether the risk
of warrantless surveillance may be imposed on all members of society at the
sole discretion of the police.

 

    I
begin by stating what seems to me to be obvious:  that, as a general
proposition, surreptitious electronic surveillance of the individual by an
agency of the state constitutes an unreasonable search or seizure under s. 8  of
the Charter .  The Ontario Court of Appeal has so held on at least
two occasions; R. v. Finlay and Grellette (1985), 23 C.C.C.
(3d) 48, at p. 61 (leave to appeal refused, [1986] 1 S.C.R. ix); R. v. Wong (1987),
34 C.C.C. (3d) 51, at p. 58.  Accordingly, the Crown conceded this point in the
courts below and did not seriously press the matter here.  The Attorney General
for Ontario, for its part, assumed though it did not concede the point, and the
Attorney General of Quebec did not deal with it at all.

 

    It
should come as no surprise that these parties shied away from engaging in such
an unequal contest.  Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R.
145, instructs us that the primary value served by s. 8  is privacy, and, as I
noted in R. v. Dyment, [1988] 2 S.C.R.
417, at p. 426, the spirit of s. 8  must not be constrained by narrow legalistic
classifications.  If one is to give s. 8  the purposive meaning attributed to it
by Hunter v. Southam Inc., one can scarcely imagine a state activity
more dangerous to individual privacy than electronic surveillance and to which,
in consequence, the protection accorded by s. 8  should be more directly aimed,
an issue I shall more fully develop as I go along.

 

    Not
surprisingly, then, the Crown sought to focus more sharply on participant
surveillance and to draw a distinction between it and other types of electronic
surveillance.  If that endeavour is to succeed, however, one must proceed on
the assumption that the factors that support the imposition of a requirement
for an authorization in the third party interception (i.e., non-participatory
surveillance) of private communications hold no currency where participant
surveillance is concerned.  This proposition takes one back to the rationale
for the regulation of electronic surveillance generally, and I shall now deal
with it at greater length.

 

    The
rationale for regulating the power of the state to record communications that
their originator expects will not be intercepted by anyone other than the person
intended by the originator to receive it (see definition section of Part IV.1
of the Code) has nothing to do with protecting individuals from the
threat that their interlocutors will divulge communications that are meant to
be private.  No set of laws could immunize us from that risk.  Rather, the
regulation of electronic surveillance protects us from a risk of a different
order, i.e., not the risk that someone will repeat our words but the much more
insidious danger inherent in allowing the state, in its unfettered discretion,
to record and transmit our words.

 

    The
reason for this protection is the realization that if the state were free, at
its sole discretion, to make permanent electronic recordings of our private
communications, there would be no meaningful residuum to our right to live our
lives free from surveillance.  The very efficacy of electronic surveillance is
such that it has the potential, if left unregulated, to annihilate any
expectation that our communications will remain private.  A society which
exposed us, at the whim of the state, to the risk of having a permanent
electronic recording made of our words every time we opened our mouths might be
superbly equipped to fight crime, but would be one in which privacy no longer
had any meaning.  As Douglas J., dissenting in United States v.
White, supra, put it, at p. 756:  ""Electronic
surveillance is the greatest leveler of human privacy ever known.""  If the
state may arbitrarily record and transmit our private communications, it is no
longer possible to strike an appropriate balance between the right of the
individual to be left alone and the right of the state to intrude on privacy in
the furtherance of its goals, notably the need to investigate and combat crime.

 

    This
is not to deny that it is of vital importance that law enforcement agencies be
able to employ electronic surveillance in their investigation of crime. 
Electronic surveillance plays an indispensable role in the detection of
sophisticated criminal enterprises.  Its utility in the investigation of drug
related crimes, for example, has been proven time and again.  But, for the
reasons I have touched on, it is unacceptable in a free society that the
agencies of the state be free to use this technology at their sole discretion. 
The threat this would pose to privacy is wholly unacceptable.

 

    It
thus becomes necessary to strike a reasonable balance between the right of
individuals to be left alone and the right of the state to intrude on privacy
in the furtherance of its responsibilities for law enforcement.  Parliament has
attempted to do this by enacting Part IV.1 of the Code.  An
examination of Part IV.1 reveals that Parliament has sought to reconcile these
competing interests by providing that the police must always seek prior judicial
authorization before using electronic surveillance.  Only a superior court
judge can authorize electronic surveillance, and the legislative scheme sets a
high standard for obtaining these authorizations.  A judge must be satisfied
that other investigative methods would fail, or have little likelihood of
success, and that the granting of the authorization is in the best interest of
the administration of justice.  I share the approach of Martin J.A. in R. v.
Finlay and Grellette, supra, at pp. 70 et seq., that
this latter prerequisite imports as a minimum requirement that the issuing
judge must be satisfied that there are reasonable and probable grounds to
believe that an offence has been, or is being, committed and that the
authorization sought will afford evidence of that offence.  It can, I think, be
seen that the provisions and safeguards of Part IV.1 of the Code have
been designed to prevent the agencies of the state from intercepting private
communications on the basis of mere suspicion.

 

    In
proceeding in this fashion, Parliament has, in my view, succeeded in striking
an appropriate balance.  It meets the high standard of the Charter  which
guarantees the right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure by
subjecting the power of the state to record our private communications to
external restraint and requiring it to be justified by application of an
objective criterion.  The reason this represents an acceptable balance is that
the imposition of an external and objective criterion affords a measure of
protection to any citizen whose private communications have been intercepted. 
It becomes possible for the individual to call the state to account if he can
establish that a given interception was not authorized in accordance with the
requisite standard.  If privacy may be defined as the right of the individual
to determine for himself when, how, and to what extent he will release personal
information about himself, a reasonable expectation of privacy would seem to
demand that an individual may proceed on the assumption that the state may only
violate this right by recording private communications on a clandestine basis
when it has established to the satisfaction of a detached judicial officer that
an offence has been or is being committed and that interception of private
communications stands to afford evidence of the offence.

 

    This,
it seems to me, flows inexorably from the principles enunciated in Hunter v.
Southam Inc., supra.  In that case, this Court (p. 157)
made the important point that the ""assessment of the constitutionality of
a search and seizure ... must focus on its `reasonable' or `unreasonable'
impact on the subject of the search or the seizure, and not simply on its
rationality in furthering some valid government objective"".  Applying this
standard, it is fair to conclude that if the surreptitious recording of private
communications is a search and seizure within the meaning of s. 8  of the Charter , it is
because the law recognizes that a person's privacy is intruded on in an unreasonable
manner whenever the state, without a prior showing of reasonable cause before a
neutral judicial officer, arrogates to itself the right surreptitiously to record
communications that the originator expects will not be intercepted by anyone
other than the person intended by its originator to receive them, to use the
language of the Code.

 

    By
contrast to the general provisions on electronic surveillance, the Code places
no restriction on participant surveillance.  The police may employ this
practice in their absolute discretion, against whom they wish and for whatever
reasons they wish, without any limit as to place or duration.  There is a total
absence of prior judicial supervision of this practice.

 

    I am
unable to see any logic to this distinction between third party electronic
surveillance and participant surveillance.  The question whether unauthorized
electronic surveillance of private communications violates a reasonable
expectation of privacy cannot, in my view, turn on the location of the hidden
microphone.  Whether the microphone is hidden in the wall or concealed on the
body of a participant to the conversation, the assessment whether the
surreptitious recording trenches on a reasonable expectation of privacy must
turn on whether the person whose words were recorded spoke in circumstances in
which it was reasonable for that person to expect that his or her words would
only be heard by the persons he or she was addressing.  As I see it, where
persons have reasonable grounds to believe their communications are private
communications in the sense defined above, the unauthorized
surreptitious electronic recording of those communications cannot fail to be
perceived as an intrusion on a reasonable expectation of privacy.

 

    The Charter 
standard just described must, in my view, apply on a uniform basis.  To have
any meaning, it must be taken to afford protection against the arbitrary
recording of private communications every time we speak in the expectation that
our words will only be heard by the person or persons to whom we direct our
remarks.  Section 8  of the Charter  guarantees the right to be secure
against unreasonable search or seizure.  Our perception that we are protected
against arbitrary interceptions of private communications ceases to have any
real basis once it is accepted that the state is free to record private
communications, without constraint, provided only that it has secured the
agreement of one of the parties to the communication.  Since we can never know
if our listener is an informer, and since if he proves to be one, we are to be
taken to be tacitly consenting to the risk that the state may be listening to
and recording our conversations, we should be prepared to run this risk every
time we speak.  I conclude that the risk analysis relied on by the Court of
Appeal, when taken to its logical conclusion, must destroy all expectations of
privacy.

 

    I am
unable to see any similarity between the risk that someone will listen to one's
words with the intention of repeating them and the risk involved when someone
listens to them while simultaneously making a permanent electronic record of
them.  These risks are of a different order of magnitude.  The one risk may, in
the context of law enforcement, be viewed as a reasonable invasion of privacy,
the other unreasonable.  They involve different risks to the individual and the
body politic.  In other words, the law recognizes that we inherently have to
bear the risk of the ""tattletale"" but draws the line at concluding
that we must also bear, as the price of choosing to speak to another human
being, the risk of having a permanent electronic recording made of our words.

 

    The
risk analysis relied on by the Court of Appeal fails to take due account of
this key fact that our right under s. 8  of the Charter  extends
to a right to be free from unreasonable invasions of our right to privacy.  The
Court of Appeal was correct in stating that the expression of an idea and the
assumption of the risk of disclosure are concomitant.  However, it does not
follow that, because in any conversation we run the risk that our interlocutor
may in fact be bent on divulging our confidences, it is therefore
constitutionally proper for the person to whom we speak to make a permanent
electronic recording of that conversation.  The Charter , it is
accepted, proscribes the surreptitious recording by third parties of our
private communications on the basis of mere suspicion alone.  It would be
strange indeed if, in the absence of a warrant requirement, instrumentalities
of the state, through the medium of participant surveillance, were free to
conduct just such random fishing expeditions in the hope of uncovering evidence
of crime, or by the same token, to satisfy any curiosity they may have as to a
person's views on any matter whatsoever.

 

    In
summary, the question whether to regulate participant surveillance cannot
logically be made to turn on the expectations of individuals as to whether
their interlocutor will betray their confidence.  No justification for the
arbitrary exercise of state power can be made to rest on the simple fact that
persons often prove to be poor judges of whom to trust when divulging
confidences or on the fact that the risk of divulgation is a given in the
decision to speak to another human being.  On the other hand, the question
whether we should countenance participant surveillance has everything to do
with the need to strike a fair balance between the right of the state to
intrude on the private lives of its citizens and the right of those citizens to
be left alone.

 

    This
is the manner in which the issue has been framed in the American appellate
decisions that have rejected United States v. White, supra, in
interpreting rights to privacy in state constitutions.  The reasoning in these
decisions, in my respectful view, provides a complete answer to the view that
the risk posed by the divulgation of the informer, and that posed by letting
the agents of the state, at their whim, surreptitiously record private
communications to which they are privy, are risks of the same order.  These
decisions make an eloquent case in support of the proposition that unregulated
participant surveillance cannot be reconciled with the right to be secure
against unreasonable search and seizure.

 

State
Appellate Decisions Rejecting United States v.
White

 

    I
turn first to a decision of the Supreme Court of Alaska in State v.
Glass, 583 P.2d 872 (1978), in which the court, in
interpreting that state's constitutional right to privacy, held that a person
who engages in a private conversation is entitled to assume that his words will
not be broadcast or recorded, absent his consent or the existence of a
warrant.  In reaching his decision, Boochever C.J. quoted at length from the
dissenting judgment of Hufstedler J. in Holmes v. Burr, 486
F.2d 55 (1973).  In the latter case, one Marburger had permitted his telephone
conversation with Holmes to be recorded.  Hufstedler J., at pp. 71-72, makes
the initial observation that it is aberrant to import the notion of risk in
assessing the constitutionality of ""participant"" surveillance:

 

This
doctrine, relied upon by the majority in the case at bench, is a hybrid of
factual and fictitious elements and of individual and societal judgments.  If
Holmes knew that his conversation might be electronically intercepted by the
government, or if warrantless electronic monitoring were so pervasive that he
is chargeable with such knowledge, a factual foundation would exist for
invoking the venerable assumption of the risk doctrine.  However, if he did not
know and if he had no reason to be aware of the risk, that doctrine is inapt. 
To say that a person ""assumes the risk"" of electronic surveillance,
although he was rightfully oblivious to the risk, is to mislabel a newly
created rule of law limiting the scope of the Fourth Amendment.

 

    In a
perceptive passage, Hufstedler J. goes on to point out, at p. 72, the fallacy
of arguing that the risk of exposure by the ""tattletale"" and the risk
of surreptitious recording are one and the same:

 

    Repetition
of conversations thought to be confidential is a known risk.  However, the risk
that one's trusted friend may be a gossip is of an entirely different order
than a risk that the friend may be transmitting and recording every syllable.  The
latter risk is not yet rooted in common American experience, and it should not
be thrust upon us:  the differences between talking to a person enswathed
in electronic equipment and one who is not are very real, and they cannot be
reduced to insignificance by verbal legerdemain.  All of us discuss topics and
use expressions with one person that we would not undertake with another and
that we would never broadcast to a crowd.  Few of us would ever speak freely if
we knew that all our words were being captured by machines for later release before
an unknown and potentially hostile audience.  No one talks to a recorder as he
talks to a person.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    The
Superior Court of Pennsylvania in Commonwealth v. Schaeffer, 536
A.2d 354 (1987), has also held that warrantless electronic surveillance
violates that state's constitutional right to be secure from unreasonable
searches and seizures.  Cirillo J., who also takes direct aim at the assumption
of risk doctrine, points out, at p. 365, that it destroys our right to fix the
limits of publicity we choose to give our remarks.  He states:

 

A person
committing his views ""to the sight of his friends"" knows he risks
misjudging his friends, but he doesn't forfeit the right to determine in the
first place to whom he will directly speak.  The body bug destroys that right
of self-determination, and if people in society come to believe the practice is
widespread and done without probable cause, they may begin to fall silent on
many occasions when previously they would have felt free to speak, confident in
the belief that they could challenge the credibility or memory of the trusted
colleague who would betray them.

 

    In
my view, the above remarks demonstrate the fallacy of the conclusion that the
risk of being recorded is simply a variant of the risk of having one's words
disclosed by the person to whom we speak.  Surreptitious electronic recording
annihilates the very important right to determine to whom we speak, i.e., the
right to choose the range of our auditors.  As pointed out by Cirillo J., at p.
365, in the case of participant surveillance, a speaker no longer has any
choice whether to disclose his private thoughts to the government.  Rather, he
is compelled to do so.  As he notes, at p. 365:

 

Every
speaker knows and accepts as a ""condition of human society"" that his
listener may go to the police, but he does not intend by speaking to give up
the right to exclude the police from his home.  But if the police are
simultaneously recording every word, they are already there, in the home,
uninvited, contrary to every reasonable expectation that most people in society
still have.

 

    Implicit
in the arguments in support of ""consent"" surveillance, it seems to
me, is the notion that a man has no one but himself to blame if he is
confounded by his own words.  Thus, if someone is imprudent enough to reveal
his wrongdoing, it makes no sense that the law discard that evidence just
because the wrongdoer spoke into a microphone.  There is a serious flaw in this
argument.  It rests on the assumption that the relevant inquiry is limited to
the legitimate expectations of privacy of ""criminals"".  But, again,
the real question raised by this appeal lies elsewhere.  As put by the
Massachusetts Supreme Court in Commonwealth v. Thorpe, 424
N.E.2d 250 (1981), at p. 258:  ""the relevant question is not whether
criminals must bear the risk of warrantless surveillance, but whether it should
be imposed on all members of society"".

 

    In
Commonwealth v. Schaeffer, supra, at p. 366, Cirillo J. concedes that
there might be room for complacency were the sole effect of warrantless
surveillance to compel criminals to engage in self-censorship.  But inasmuch as
the very premise of a warrantless procedure is that the police can engage in the
practice at their sole discretion, any sanguinity in this matter is misplaced. 
Harlan J. in his dissent in United States v. White, supra, makes
the point that the implications in allowing warrantless surveillance cannot be
narrowly circumscribed.  He stated, at p. 789:

 

... it
is too easy to forget ‑- and, hence, too often forgotten ‑- that
the issue here is whether to interpose a search warrant procedure between law
enforcement agencies engaging in electronic eavesdropping and the public
generally.  By casting its ""risk analysis"" solely in terms of the
expectations and risks that ""wrongdoers"" or ""one contemplating
illegal activities"" ought to bear, the plurality opinion, I think, misses
the mark entirely.  On Lee does not simply mandate that
criminals must daily run the risk of unknown eavesdroppers prying into their
private affairs; it subjects each and every law-abiding member of society to
that risk.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    Harlan
J. went on to make the seminal observation that the imposition of a warrant
requirement would have the sole effect of ensuring that police restrict
""participant monitoring"" to cases where they can show probable cause
for a warrant.  It is unclear to me how compelling the police to restrict this
practice to instances where they have convinced a detached judicial officer of
its necessity would hamper the police's ability effectively to combat crime. 
But even if this were so, this restriction would be justified by the knowledge
that the police would no longer have the right ""to train these powerful
eavesdropping devices on you, me, and other law-abiding citizens as well as the
criminal element"", to cite the observation of Cirillo J. in
Commonwealth v. Schaeffer, supra, at p. 367.  The appellant put the
matter trenchantly in his factum:

 

A
warrant requirement simply ensures that when the undercover agent goes in with
the potential to make a permanent, electronic record of the conversation that
takes place, it will be one that should be recorded (a proposed drug sale), as
opposed to one that should not (the suspect's sex life or his views of the
government).

 

    In
summary, I think, with respect, that Cory J.A. fails to give due weight to the
policy implications of allowing the police to conduct warrantless surveillance
when he states, at p. 394, that ""it is only those whose conversations are
concerned with various illegal activities who will be seriously concerned about
the possibility of their remarks being recorded"".  On the contrary, the
decision whether to allow or disallow this practice is fraught with the gravest
of implications.  To countenance this practice would not strike only at the
expectations of privacy of criminals and those concerned with wrongdoing. 
Rather, it would undermine the expectations of privacy of all those who set
store on the right to live in reasonable security and freedom from
surveillance, be it electronic or otherwise.  And it has long been recognized
that this freedom not to be compelled to share our confidences with others is
the very hallmark of a free society.  Yates J., in Millar v. Taylor (1769),
4 Burr. 2303, 98 E.R. 201, states, at p. 2379 and p. 242:

 

    It
is certain every man has a right to keep his own sentiments, if he pleases:  he
has certainly a right to judge whether he will make them public, or commit them
only to the sight of his friends.

 

    If
this Court is to give its imprimatur to the practice of warrantless
electronic surveillance, the words of Harlan J., dissenting in United
States v. White, supra, at pp. 787-89, may fairly be said to
apply:

 

    Authority
is hardly required to support the proposition that words would be measured a
good deal more carefully and communication inhibited if one suspected his
conversations were being transmitted and transcribed.  Were third-party bugging
a prevalent practice, it might well smother that spontaneity ‑ reflected
in frivolous, impetuous, sacrilegious, and defiant discourse ‑ that
liberates daily life.  Much off-hand exchange is easily forgotten and one may
count on the obscurity of his remarks, protected by the very fact of a limited
audience, and the likelihood that the listener will either overlook or forget
what is said, as well as the listener's inability to reformulate a conversation
without having to contend with a documented record.  All these values are
sacrificed by a rule of law that permits official monitoring of private
discourse limited only by the need to locate a willing assistant. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

The
Undermining of Part IV.1 of the Code

 

    The
appellant raises the additional point that dispensing the police from the
requirement to seek a warrant for conducting participant surveillance
effectively allows the police to do indirectly what Part IV.1 of the Code
prohibits them from doing directly.  Faced with the choice of having to seek a
warrant, and being able to proceed without one, it can reasonably be expected
that they will, circumstances permitting, elect to proceed without one.

 

    Here,
the police, acting without any judicial authorization, wired an apartment for a
period of some two years, installed listening devices in another location, and
employed an automobile location beeper.  In circumstances such as these, where
the police have evidence of a conspiracy and have elicited the services of an
informer, can there be any compelling reason to suggest that the interests of
justice would not be better served by requiring the police to attend before a
superior court judge to obtain an authorization as opposed to letting the
police be the sole arbiters of the scope of the investigation and its duration?

 

    It
is worth noting, in this regard, the basis for the conclusion of Martin J.A. in R. v.
Finlay and Grellette, supra, that Part IV.1 of the Code is
constitutional.  While he was ready to accept that the interception of private
communications does constitute a search and seizure within the meaning of those
terms as they are used in the Charter , he concluded that
such searches and seizures, when authorized in accordance with the requirements
of Part IV.1 of the Code, would ordinarily be reasonable
precisely and solely because the provisions and safeguards of Part IV.1
preclude the police from embarking on fishing expeditions in the hope of
uncovering evidence of crime.

 

    With
regard to these safeguards it is worth remembering that Part IV.1 of the Code:

 

(a)stipulates that authorizations for electronic
surveillance are only to be given on a showing that there is no real practical
alternative (s. 178.13(1)); in other words, as put by the Ontario Court of
Appeal in R. v. Playford (1987), 40 C.C.C.
(3d) 142, at p. 185:  ""... it is treated as a last resort investigative
mechanism"", and can only be obtained for investigation of the most serious
offences in the Code (s. 178.1);

 

(b)sets strict time limits on authorizations (s.
178.13(2)(e));

 

(c)prescribes that a judge may include any conditions
and restrictions that he considers advisable in the public interest;

 

(d)authorizes renewals only on a showing of cause and a
detailing of all interceptions made prior to the request for the authorization
and the number of previous authorizations;

 

(e)mandates that notification be given to the person
whose communications have been intercepted (s. 178.23(1));

 

(f)requires the Solicitor General of Canada to prepare a
comprehensive report on all electronic surveillance conducted pursuant to
authorizations (s. 178.22(1));

 

(g)engages the responsibility of the Attorney General of
the province in which the application is sought, or of the Solicitor General
(or duly appointed agents) (s. 178.12(1)); and

 

(h)provides that authorizations may only issue on the
order of a superior court judge (s. 178.12(1)).

 

    If
the constitutionality of Part IV.1 of the Code is
predicated on the numerous safeguards designed to prevent the possibility that
the police view recourse to electronic surveillance as a humdrum and routine
administrative matter, it would seem anomalous that participant surveillance,
which leaves to the sole discretion of the police all the conditions under
which conversations are intercepted, should be held to meet the definition of
""reasonable"" in the context of s. 8  of the Charter .  I
think that the appellant makes a good point when he submits that the
large-scale police investigative activity using participant surveillance for
monitoring and recording private conversations effectively by-passes any
judicial consideration of the entire police procedures and thereby makes
irrelevant the entire scheme in Part IV.1 of the Code.

 

    As
was put by Martin J.A. in R. v. Finlay and Grellette, supra, at p.
70:

 

Authorizing
such a serious intrusion on the individual's reasonable expectation of privacy
as the interception of his private communications on the basis of mere
suspicion would not further the interests of the administration
of justice, but would bring it into disrepute.

 

Section
1  Justification

 

    It
is necessary to make only brief mention of possible justification under s. 1 of
the police action in this case.  The question whether participant surveillance
constitutes a reasonable limit on the right to be secure against unreasonable
search or seizure takes one back to the point that the appellant is in no way
arguing that the police should be denied the right to use informers or to
intercept communications themselves once they have gained the confidence of a
suspect.  The sole thrust of his argument is that judicial supervision of the
practice should exist, just as it exists in the case of third party
surveillance.  In a word, there is no justification for warrantless searches
once it is accepted that the police could employ the same investigatory tool
with or without a warrant.  This simple fact (and I find no argument by the
respondent refuting the notion that the police could have attended before a
judge to secure an authorization for participant surveillance) destroys, in my
view, any argument that participant surveillance can be upheld as a reasonable
limit to the right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure.

 

    To
conclude, the Charter  is not meant to protect us against a
poor choice of friends.  If our ""friend"" turns out to be an informer,
and we are convicted on the strength of his testimony, that may be unfortunate
for us.  But the Charter  is meant to guarantee the right to be
secure against unreasonable search and seizure.  A conversation with an
informer does not amount to a search and seizure within the meaning of the Charter . 
Surreptitious electronic interception and recording of a private communication
does.  Such recording, moreover, should be viewed as a search and seizure in
all circumstances save where all parties to the conversation have
expressly consented to its being recorded.  Accordingly the constitutionality
of ""participant surveillance"" should fall to be determined by
application of the same standard as that employed in third party surveillance,
i.e., by application of the standard of reasonableness enunciated in Hunter v.
Southam Inc., supra.  By application of that standard,
the warrantless participant surveillance engaged in by the police here was
clearly unconstitutional.

 

Admissibility
in Evidence

 

    The
next question is whether the communication in this case may be admitted into
evidence.  Section 178.16(1) of the Code deals with
admissibility as follows:

    178.16 (1) A private communication that has
been intercepted is inadmissible as evidence against the originator of the
communication or the person intended by the originator to receive it unless

 

(a) the interception was lawfully made; or

 

(b) the originator thereof or the person intended by the
originator to receive it has expressly consented to the admission thereof;

 

but
evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of information acquired by
interception of a private communication is not inadmissible by reason only that
the private communication is itself inadmissible as evidence.

 

That
provision, it should be noted, does not make a communication admissible.  If it
is admissible, that is by virtue of the common law.  What the provision does is
to make such communication inadmissible unless its interception was (a)
lawfully made, or (b) made with the consent of one of the parties to the
communication.  I shall deal with the second condition first.  That condition
was clearly met.  Consent was given prior to the communication and however
unreasonable reliance on such consent may have been for the purposes of Charter  review,
the communication is not inadmissible under s. 178.16(1) (b).

 

    The
first condition poses more difficulty.  Since the interception here was
unreasonable within the meaning of s. 8  of the Charter , it
might well be argued that it was not lawfully made for the purposes of s.
178.16(1) .  But I do not think the provision can be so read because what makes
the interception unreasonable is the activity excepted from the application by
s. 178.16(1) (b).  Section 178.16(1) (a),
therefore, appears to relate to other unlawfulness and, in particular, an
interception that violates the prohibition in s. 178.11(2)  which, we saw, does
not apply to the interception in question here.  The communication then is not
made inadmissible by s. 178.16(1) .  It would thus appear admissible as relevant
evidence.

 

    That
being so, one must consider the question of the admissibility of the
communication under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  That provision
provides that evidence that was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied
any right or freedom guaranteed under the Charter  shall
be excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances,
its admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

 

    In R. v.
Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, Lamer J. dealt with the manner in
which s. 24(2)  must be approached.  The first point to observe is that the onus
is on the person who seeks the exclusion of evidence to establish that its
admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  Lamer J.,
at pp. 283-84, set forth many of the factors to be considered, namely:

 

-‑what kind of evidence was obtained?

 

‑-what Charter  right was
infringed?

 

‑-was the Charter 
violation serious or was it of a merely technical nature?

 

‑-was it deliberate, wilful or flagrant, or was it
inadvertent or committed in good faith?

 

‑-did it occur in circumstances of urgency or
necessity?

 

‑-were there other investigatory techniques
available?

 

‑-would the evidence have been obtained in any
event?

 

‑-is the offence serious?

 

‑-is the evidence essential to substantiate the
charge?

 

‑-are other remedies available?

 

    Of
cardinal importance in assessing these factors is the fairness of the process,
and, in particular, its impact on the fairness of the trial.  Undoubtedly, the
breach infringed upon an important Charter  right, and the
evidence could have been obtained without breaching the Charter .  But
what strikes one here is that the breach was in no way deliberate, wilful or
flagrant.  The police officers acted entirely in good faith.  They were acting
in accordance with what they had good reason to believe was the law ‑- as
it had been for many years before the advent of the Charter .  The
reasonableness of their action is underscored by the seriousness of the
offence.  They had reasonable and probable cause to believe the offence had
been committed, and had they properly understood the law, they could have
obtained an authorization under the Code to intercept the
communication.  Indeed, they could have proceeded without resorting to
electronic surveillance and relied solely on the evidence of the undercover
officer or the informer.  In short, the Charter  breach
stemmed from an entirely reasonable misunderstanding of the law by the police
officers who would otherwise have obtained the necessary evidence to convict
the accused in any event.  Under these circumstances, I hold that the appellant
has not established that the admission of the evidence would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute.

 

Disposition

 

    I
would dismiss the appeal.  I would answer the constitutional questions as
follows:

 

1.Does
section 178.11(2)(a) of the Criminal Code ,
legalizing the interception of private communications with the consent of the
originator or intended recipient thereof, without the need for judicial
authorization, infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 8  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Section 178.11(2)(a) of the Code does
not infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 8  of the Charter , but
the interception of private communications by an instrumentality of the state
with the consent of the originator or intended recipient thereof, without prior
judicial authorization, does infringe the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s.
8 .

 

2.If
section 178.11(2)(a) of the Criminal Code  does
infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 8  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , is it justified by s. 1  of the Charter  and
therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

It is not necessary to answer this question.

 

//Lamer J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    LAMER J. --
My colleague, Justice La Forest, has set out the facts, the law, the judgments
below and the positions of the parties before this Court.  I am of the view
that this appeal fails.  I have read the unanimous judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario, written by Cory J.A., as he then was.  I am in complete
agreement with those reasons and I feel I cannot improve upon them.  They are
conveniently reported at (1987), 60 C.R. (3d) 142, 38 C.C.C. (3d) 1.

 

    Consequently,
I need not address the issue as to whether the evidence should be excluded
under s. 24(2)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and I
would dismiss this appeal.

 

     Appeal
dismissed.  Section 178.11(2)(a) of the Criminal Code, does not infringe or
deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 8 of the  Charter, but the
interception of private communications by an instrumentality of the state with
the consent of the originator or intended recipient thereof, without prior
judicial authorization, does infringe the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s.
8.  It was not necessary to answer the second question.

conclusion of a voir dire to determine the admissibility of the
intercepted communications, the trial judge refused to order the opening of the
sealed packets containing the affidavits upon which the authorizations were
granted and found the wiretap evidence to be admissible.  He convicted
appellant.  Relying on its decision in Playford, released after the
trial judge's ruling, the Court of Appeal found that appellant was entitled to
have access to the sealed packets.  The affidavits were edited to protect
confidential informants and then released to him.  The court found that the
editing did not impair counsel's ability to determine the facial validity of
the affidavits, that the affidavits set out sufficient indicia of reliability of
the informant involved, and that they set out ample facts to meet
constitutional requirements for a reasonable search and seizure.  Since
appellant had not shown that the affiant had made a false statement knowingly
and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, he was not
entitled to cross‑examine him.  The court concluded that the trial
judge's refusal to permit appellant to have access to the affidavits did not
result in a miscarriage of justice and upheld the conviction.  The main issues on
this appeal are whether the accused is entitled to access to the material in
the sealed packet; on what terms an accused may challenge an authorization for
wiretap;  special requirements relating to informants;  the procedure for
editing affidavits in the sealed packet;  whether the accused is entitled to
cross‑examine on the affidavits; and whether the authorizing judge's
failure to include a minimization clause resulted in authorization of an
unreasonable search and seizure in violation of s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms .

 

Held (L'Heureux‑Dubé and McLachlin
JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed.

 

Per Dickson C.J. and Lamer C.J. and La
Forest, Sopinka and Gonthier JJ.:  The Court of Appeal was right to open the
sealed packets since the accused is entitled, subject to editing, to have their
contents produced in order to enable him to make full answer and defence.

 

Since wiretaps constitute a
search or seizure, the statutory provisions authorizing them must conform to
the minimum constitutional requirements demanded by s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms .  The issuing judge must be satisfied that there are
reasonable and probable grounds to believe that an offence has been or is being
committed, and that the authorization sought will afford evidence of that
offence.

 








The procedures available for
challenging a wiretap authorization are:  (1) a Parsons voir dire before
the trial judge to determine whether the authorization is valid on its face,
the remedy being exclusion under s. 178.16 of the Code; (2) a Wilson
application before the issuing court to determine the substantive or subfacial
validity of the affidavit, the remedy being the setting aside of the
authorization; (3) a Garofoli hearing before the trial judge to
determine whether the authorization complies with s. 8  of the Charter , the remedy being
a determination of whether the evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2)  of
the Charter ; and (4) a Vanweenan hearing before the trial judge
to determine whether the authorization names all ""known"" persons as
required by ss. 178.12(1)(e) and 178.13(2)(c) of the Code,
the remedy being exclusion under s. 178.16 .

 

When it is asserted by an
accused that a wiretap infringes s. 8  of the Charter , the application
for review should be made to the trial judge, even though applications to open
the sealed packed must be made to a judge designated in s. 178.14(1)(a)(ii)
of the Code, who in some cases will not be the trial judge.  In
determining whether a search is reasonable under s. 8  of the Charter , the reviewing
judge must determine whether the Code requirements have been satisfied,
since the statutory conditions are identical to the requirements of s. 8 .  Whereas
Wilson precluded a review of the authorizing judge's decision that the
statutory conditions had been complied with, unless some ground such as fraud
or new evidence was established, the application of s. 8  requires review as a step in
determining the reasonableness of the search and seizure.  If, based on the
record, the reviewing judge concludes that the authorizing judge could have
granted the authorization, then he should not interfere.  A finding that the
interception is unlawful attracts the peremptory language of s. 178.16  and
the evidence is inadmissible.  Section 24(2)  of the Charter  cannot have
the effect of making the evidence admissible even if its admission would not
bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  Accordingly, an accused
who has invoked s. 24  and established that an interception was
unlawfully obtained is entitled to have the evidence excluded under s. 178.16 .

 

Hearsay statements of an
informant can provide reasonable and probable grounds to justify a search, but
evidence of an informer's tip, by itself, is insufficient to establish
reasonable and probable grounds.  The reliability of a tip is to be assessed by
having regard to the totality of the circumstances.  The results of the search
cannot, ex post facto, provide evidence of the reliability of the
information.

 








The courts clearly have a
power to edit derived from the supervising and protecting power they have over
their own records.  In determining what to edit, the judge will have
regard for the rule against disclosure of police informers, subject to the
""innocence at stake"" exception.  The determination in each case will
require a balancing of the relevance of the identity of the informer to the accused's
case against the prejudice to the informer and to the public interest in law
enforcement which disclosure would occasion.

 

The preconditions for cross‑examination
of the affiant imposed by the Court of Appeal, based largely on the American
case of Franks v. Delaware, are too restrictive.  This Court has
consistently protected the right to cross‑examine.  The concerns
regarding protection of the identity of informers and prolongation of
proceedings can be accommodated without such a drastic curtailment of the right. 
There is no right to cross‑examine informers, since they are not
witnesses and cannot be identified unless the accused brings himself within the
""innocence at stake"" exception.  Leave to cross‑examine should
be granted at the discretion of the trial judge, who may impose limitations on
its scope, when he is satisfied that cross‑examination is necessary to
enable the accused to make full answer and defence.  The accused must establish
a basis for the view that cross‑examination will oppugn the existence of
one of the preconditions for the authorization.

 

Appellant has shown a basis
for cross‑examination here.  In view of the degree of reliance by the
police on the informer in this case, if the informer is discredited then the
factual basis for the authorization is undermined.  Since appellant was not
permitted to cross‑examine the affiant, there should be a new trial.

 








The failure of the
authorizing judge to impose conditions minimizing the interception of
irrelevant communications does not result in the authorization of an
unreasonable search and seizure in violation of s. 8  of the Charter .  An absolute
requirement of live monitoring in all cases would impose too heavy a burden on
Canadian law enforcement officials.  While a requirement of live monitoring
or visual confirmation would generally be appropriate when telephone calls are
to be intercepted at public pay telephones, the same considerations do not
apply with respect to the private residence of a person named in an
authorization unless there are special circumstances calling for live
monitoring, and appellant has not satisfied the Court that any special
considerations are involved here.

 

Per L'Heureux‑Dubé and McLachlin
JJ. (dissenting):  Since the power of a judge to grant a wiretap authorization
subject to the preconditions set out in s. 178.13(1) of the Code must be
exercised in conformity with the Charter , the section should be
read so as to require that the judge be satisfied that there are reasonable
grounds to believe that the specified offence has been or is being committed,
and that evidence of the offence will be obtained by the interception sought. 
Apart from this limitation on a judge's ability to authorize a wiretap, the
direct protection for individuals comes from two sources:  s. 178.16(1)(a)
of the Code, which states that to be admissible in evidence an
electronic interception must have been ""lawfully made"", and s. 24(2)  of
the Charter , which provides for the exclusion of evidence where the
evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed a Charter  right and it
is established that its admission would bring the administration of justice
into disrepute.  An accused seeking to exclude evidence of an interception has
two remedies:  (1) a Wilson application to a superior court to set aside
the authorization, thereby rendering the interception not ""lawfully
made"" within the terms of s. 178.16(1) (a); and (2) a Garofoli
application before the trial judge (often a provincial court judge) for
exclusion of the intercepted evidence on the ground that it constitutes an
unreasonable search and seizure under s. 8  of the Charter  and its admission
would tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute under s. 24(2) .

 








The question of whether the
packet should be opened is a matter within the discretion of the judge hearing
the application, who must balance the interests of the accused in the
protection of privacy and a fair trial, including the right to make full answer
and defence, with the public interest in the administration of justice.  Given
the importance of the accused's right to make full answer and defence, the
balance will generally fall in favour of opening the packet, subject to editing
and special concerns for the administration of justice which may arise in
particular cases.  Here the Court of Appeal held that the packet
should have been opened, subject to editing, and the balance in this case
mandates that conclusion.

 

In deciding whether the
accused may cross‑examine on the affidavit, the judge must again balance
the interests of the accused with the public interest in the administration of
justice.  Given that cross‑examination may present greater problems for
the administration of justice and less importance, from the point of view of
ensuring a fair trial, than does access to the packet, the balance will
generally favour denial unless the accused is able to make a preliminary
showing establishing the special relevance of the cross‑examination.  In
this case appellant has not established that cross‑examination was likely
to assist him in presenting a full answer and defence, and it posed risks of
disclosure of confidential police information and of lengthening the
proceedings to no purpose.  In these circumstances the balance clearly favours
rejection of the right to cross‑examine.

The judgment of Dickson C.J.
and Lamer C.J. and La Forest, Sopinka and Gonthier JJ. was delivered by








SOPINKA J. -- This appeal is
part of a series of appeals heard together by the Court dealing with various
aspects of the law relating to the interception of private communications
(hereinafter ""wiretaps"").  The other cases in the series are Dersch
v. Canada (Attorney General), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, R. v. Lachance,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, and R. v. Zito, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000.  This appeal
addresses a number of issues consequent upon the opening of the sealed packet. 
Principal among them are the grounds for challenges to the validity of
authorizations, what is the appropriate editing of wiretap affidavits, and
cross-examination on the affidavit relied on in support of an authorization.

 

Facts

 

The appellant was convicted
with four others (Scibetta, Criminisi, Vanderkooy, and Allen) of conspiring to
import a narcotic (cocaine).  The principal evidence consisted of: (a)
intercepted private communications, many of which were between Garofoli in
Hamilton and Frank Savasta in Florida; (b) the evidence of Earl Smith, who was
employed by Savasta to transport three kilograms of cocaine from Florida to
Hamilton in November 1983; (c) the evidence of Biebuyck, as to the purchase by
Vanderkooy of a quantity of cocaine in November or December 1983, and the
subsequent sale and the delivery of certain of the proceeds to Scibetta; and
(d) evidence confirming the presence of Smith in Hamilton in November 1983 and
Savasta in Hamilton in January 1984.

 








The Court of Appeal held that
the jury would be warranted in finding the following facts.  Garofoli in
Hamilton arranged with Savasta in Florida to purchase three kilograms of
cocaine.  On November 20, 1983, Criminisi and Allen flew to Florida and paid
Savasta $20,000 of a total price of $61,000 for three kilograms of cocaine. 
Criminisi rented a car, and the cocaine was placed in its spare tire.  Smith
and Allen drove the car to Buffalo where Smith was to collect the balance of
the purchase price.  Smith and Allen registered at a hotel in Buffalo, and were
joined by Scibetta.  It was decided that Smith would drive the car across the
border.  After crossing the border, Smith and Allen drove to a hotel in
Hamilton where they registered as guests early in the morning of November 23. 
Later that morning, Criminisi and Scibetta joined them at the hotel.  Scibetta
removed the spare tire from the rental car's trunk, put it in his car, and
drove away.  Smith, Criminisi and Allen went to the M & R Auto Body Shop,
and met Garofoli and others.  The car was stored there, with the Florida
licence plates removed.

 

Smith remained in Hamilton,
attempting to collect the balance of the purchase price.  Around November 27
Criminisi paid him a further $10,000.  A few days later, Smith, Criminisi and
Allen went to Garofoli's home to discuss the balance.  They telephoned Savasta
at his office in Florida from a nearby pay telephone.  Criminisi spoke first to
Savasta.  Then Garofoli spoke to Savasta, telling him he could be trusted to
pay the balance.  While speaking to Savasta, he gave $4,790 to Criminisi which
he gave to Smith.  Then Smith spoke to Savasta who told him to return to
Florida.

 

In late November or in early
December 1983, Vanderkooy and Biebuyck drove to the M & R Body Shop. 
Vanderkooy went in, returned with Scibetta, and pointed to his car.  Vanderkooy
and Biebuyck left, and returned about one half-hour later.  Vanderkooy again
went into the shop.  He returned and drove to Biebuyck's home, where he removed
a package containing a kilogram of cocaine from the trunk of his car.  The
cocaine was divided into one-ounce packages.  Most of it was sold, with certain
of the proceeds being turned over to Scibetta.

 








After Smith returned to
Florida, there were several telephone calls from Savasta to Garofoli concerning
payment of the money.  In January 1984 Savasta came to Hamilton where he met
with Garofoli.

 

During the investigation,
there were four orders authorizing the interception of the private
communications.   They were granted September 26, September 29, November 21 and
December 30, 1983, by judges of the High Court of Justice of the Supreme Court
of Ontario.  The evidence of Garofoli's involvement in the conspiracy is
derived in large measure from private communications intercepted under these
authorizations.  These included telephone conversations which ostensibly
referred to the importing of various automobiles and jewelry, but which the
jury were invited to interpret as referring to cocaine.

 

At the conclusion of a voir
dire to determine the admissibility of the intercepted communications, the
trial judge refused to order the opening of the sealed packets containing the
affidavits upon which the orders were obtained and ordered that the wiretap
evidence was admissible.  The appellant did not appear for the next day of the
trial.  The trial was adjourned while inquiries were made as to his
whereabouts.  When it appeared that there was no explanation for his absence, a
bench warrant was issued for his arrest.  Pursuant to s. 431.1 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, the trial judge made a finding that he had
absconded and ordered that the trial continue in his absence.  The appellant's
counsel was permitted to withdraw at that point.

 

The appellant appealed to the
Court of Appeal of Ontario against his conviction and sentence on numerous
grounds.  It dismissed the appeal against conviction but allowed the appeal
against sentence.

 








Courts Below

 

Court of Appeal (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 97

 

Martin J.A., Cory J.A. Concurring

 

The first ground of appeal
considered by the court was whether the trial judge erred in refusing the
appellant access to the affidavits upon which the authorizations were granted. 
The trial judge had held that the appellant had not provided the necessary
evidentiary basis for being granted access, nor established that denial of
access contravened s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

The trial judge's ruling was
made before the release of R. v. Playford (1987), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 142
(Ont. C.A.), which held that an accused is entitled to access to the sealed
packet, generally speaking, as of right.  The Court of Appeal itself opened the
sealed packets, pursuant to s. 610(1) (a) of the Criminal Code ,
to determine whether any substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred.  The
affidavits were edited as proposed by Crown counsel to protect confidential
informants and then released to the appellant.

 

There was inconsistency among
the dates contained in the documents for the November 21 authorization.  The
Court of Appeal, pursuant to s. 610(1) (b) of the Criminal Code ,
heard evidence from Roderick Flaherty, the agent designated by the Solicitor
General to apply for the authorization and the commissioner who had sworn the
affidavit.  Flaherty was cross-examined by the appellant's counsel.  The Court
of Appeal was satisfied that the inconsistent dates were the result of a
clerical error.

 








Martin J.A. then reviewed the
law with respect to the review of orders authorizing the interception of
private communications.  The Supreme Court of Canada, in Wilson v. The Queen,
[1983] 2 S.C.R. 594, held that an authorization which has not been set aside is
not subject to collateral attack and must receive full effect according to its
terms.  An authorization may be set aside on the grounds of fraud, material
non-disclosure, misleading disclosure or the discovery of new evidence that
shows that the actual facts are different from those upon which the
authorization was granted.  The application to set aside the authorization (a
""Wilson application"") must be made to the same court, though
not necessarily the same judge, that authorized the interceptions.  Martin J.A.
noted that there is no appeal directly from a ruling on a Wilson
application.  He suggested, however, that a record of a Wilson
application should be kept, which can be filed before the trial judge.  The
Crown or the accused could then appeal the Wilson ruling on an appeal
from acquittal or conviction.

 

Martin J.A. then examined the
effect of the Charter  on the review of wiretap authorizations.  In his
view, the Charter  does not expand the grounds, set out in Wilson,
upon which an order to set aside an authorization may be based.  However, the Charter 
does alter the power of a trial judge to go behind an authorization. 
If, at the trial, the accused alleges that the authorization constitutes an
unreasonable search or seizure and thereby infringes s. 8  of the Charter , the trial judge
has a duty to hear submissions or evidence on this point and to rule on the
lawfulness of the interception.  The trial judge may not necessarily have the
power to set aside the authorization, where, for instance, the conditions
outlined in Wilson are not met.  But he or she may, without setting
aside the order, hold that the necessary statutory conditions for the granting
of the authorization were not met and that the interception constitutes an
unreasonable search and seizure in violation of s. 8 .

 








A finding that the
interception constituted an unreasonable search, however, will not necessarily
result in the exclusion of the evidence.  If the authorization has not been set
aside on a Wilson application, the evidence can only be excluded if the
trial judge decides, under s. 24(2)  of the Charter , that the admission
of the evidence could bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 
Martin J.A. leaves open the issue whether s. 24(1)  could be employed to quash an
authorization.

 

Martin J.A. then reviewed
American law with respect to applications for orders authorizing electronic
surveillance.  Under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets
Act, 18 U.S.C. {SS} {SS} 2510-20 (1988), a trial judge may
suppress the contents of any intercepted wire or oral communication, among
other things, on the ground that the communication was unlawfully intercepted. 
With respect to examining affidavits for conformity with the Criminal Code 
in order to judge the reasonableness of a search and seizure under s. 8  of the Charter ,
he approved of two American cases in particular.  First, United States v.
Tufaro, 593 F. Supp. 476 (S.D.N.Y. 1983), held that an interception order
carries a presumption of validity.  Deference is given to the determination of
the issuing judge by demanding only that a ""substantial basis"" for
finding probable cause existed.   Second, People v. Baris, 500 N.Y.S. 2d
572 (A.D. 4 Dept. 1986), held that in showing the necessity of electronic
surveillance (similar to the requirement in ss. 178.12(1) (g) and
178.13(1) (b)) a common sense approach must be taken whereby
eavesdropping should not be used routinely as a first investigative step but
neither should the police be required to show that it is a last resort.

 








Martin J.A. also approved of
U.S. law with respect to going behind the face of the affidavit to attack the
truth of the statements contained in it.  The U.S. Supreme Court in Franks
v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), held that the Fourth Amendment demands an
evidentiary hearing if the accused makes a substantial preliminary showing that
a false statement was included by the affiant intentionally or with reckless
disregard for the truth and that the false statement is necessary to the
finding of probable cause.  If at the hearing the allegation of perjury or
reckless disregard for the truth is established by a preponderance of evidence,
and the remaining content of the affidavit is insufficient to establish
probable cause, then the warrant is to be treated as a nullity and the fruits
of the search excluded.  Martin J.A. noted that the U.S. Supreme Court held
that truthfulness in this context is not equivalent to correctness.  A warrant
can be based on hearsay, statements from informers, etc.  The affidavit must
only be truthful in the sense that the information put forth is believed or
appropriately accepted by the affiant as true.

 

Applying these conclusions to
the facts of the case, Martin J.A. held with respect to the facial sufficiency
of the affidavits that: (1) the editing of the affidavits did not impair
counsel's ability to assess their content to determine their facial validity;
(2) the affidavits set out sufficient indicia of reliability of an informant,
whose statements form some of the facts included in the affidavit; and (3) the
affidavits set out ample facts to meet constitutional requirements for a
reasonable search and seizure.

 

With respect to the
truthfulness of the affidavits, Martin J.A. held that the appellant made no
preliminary showing that the affiant knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly
made a false statement in his affidavit in support of the authorizations.  In
his application to cross-examine the affiant, the appellant had attacked the
truthfulness of assertions in the affidavits provided by an informant.  This
will be described below in greater detail.  Martin J.A. held that the appellant
had not made the requisite showing to justify an evidentiary hearing.  Even if
the informant was mistaken or had lied, there was no showing that Constable
Campbell had made a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with
reckless disregard for the truth.  The appellant therefore was not entitled to
cross-examine Constable Campbell.








Martin J.A. therefore
concluded that the refusal of the trial judge to permit the appellant to have
access to the affidavits did not result in a miscarriage of justice.

 

Other issues raised by the
appellant included an argument that the judge's instructions were insufficient
with respect to accepting the evidence of witnesses Smith and Biebuyck.  The
trial judge noted that they had criminal records which were relevant to
assessing their credibility, that they were co-conspirators, and that it would
be prudent to look for confirmatory evidence.  He later said that their
credibility was crucial for the Crown's case, and that while their motivation
to testify was self-serving he was of the opinion that they were not lying.  He
then went on to detail the independent evidence which confirmed much of Smith's
testimony.

 

Martin J.A. concluded that it
would have been preferable had the trial judge not baldly stated that in his
opinion Smith and Biebuyck were not lying.  But, he found that this did not
amount to reversible error, in light of the abundance of independent
confirmatory evidence.

 

Another issue raised was
whether there had been sufficient proof that the appellant absconded within the
meaning of s. 431.1  of the Criminal Code .  Martin J.A. held
that ""absconds"" means voluntarily absenting oneself from a trial for
the purpose of frustrating a trial or avoiding its consequences.  He further
held that the trial judge did not misdirect himself in this respect.  It was
evident that the onus was on the Crown to prove that the appellant had
absconded although it was unclear whether this was on a balance of
probabilities or reasonable doubt.  Martin J.A. held that even assuming the
onus was reasonable doubt, there was abundant unchallenged evidence to meet the
onus.  Martin J.A. noted the significance of the timing of the appellant's
disappearance (immediately after the wiretap evidence was held admissible), and
that his counsel admitted at sentencing that he had absconded.

 








Martin J.A. rejected the
submission that much of the evidence of absconding was hearsay, and that
therefore there was no evidential basis for the trial judge's finding.  Citing McCormick
on Evidence (3rd ed. 1984), at pp. 743-44, he held that negative results of
inquiries such as were conducted in this case are regarded as non-hearsay, and,
in any event, there was ample admissible evidence to find that the appellant
had absconded.  Having properly determined that the appellant had absconded,
Martin J.A. held that the trial judge did not err by inviting the jury to draw
an adverse inference against the accused.  Nor did the trial judge err by
exercising his discretion to continue the trial in the absence of the appellant
or his counsel, who had properly withdrawn.

 

I omit Martin J.A.'s
discussion of the other nine grounds of appeal.

 

Finlayson J.A. (Concurring)

 

Finlayson J.A. added some
comments with regard to Wilson  applications.  In his view, Wilson
adds little to the inherent jurisdiction of a court to review its ex parte
orders to protect itself from becoming an instrument of fraud or abuse of
process.  The question, then, is whether it is appropriate to exercise this
inherent jurisdiction when an accused person affected by wiretaps has a remedy
at trial by reason of ss. 8  and 24(2)  of the Charter .

 








In virtually all litigated
cases, the only issue of practical concern is the admissibility of intercepted
private communications at trial.  In the interest of avoiding duplicative
judicial supervision and conflicting decisions, the best course is for the
motions judge to adjourn a Wilson application to the trial judge.  The
practice in civil cases is to direct the trial of an issue on an application or
motion where material facts are controverted.  Likewise with wiretaps, the
trial is the appropriate forum to hear all matters relating to the interception
of private communications, so that these matters can be dealt with fully and
with finality.

 

Relevant Legislation

 

Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , ss. 7 , 8 , 24(1)  and 24(2) :

 

7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty
and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

 

8. Everyone has the right to be secure
against unreasonable search or seizure.

 

24. (1) Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as
guaranteed by this Charter , have been infringed or denied may apply to a court
of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court considers
appropriate and just in the circumstances.

 

(2) Where,
in proceedings under subsection (1), a court concludes that evidence was
obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed
by this Charter , the evidence shall be excluded if it is established that,
having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings
would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

 

Criminal Code 

 








Part IV.1 of the Criminal
Code  is entitled ""Invasion of Privacy"". Section 178.1  is the
definition section.  The definition of ""offence"" for Part IV.1 is
limited to enumerated offences of a serious nature created by the Criminal
Code , the Food and Drugs Act , the Narcotic Control Act, the Customs
Act , the Excise Act , the Bankruptcy Act, and the Official
Secrets Act.  Also included are offences under the Criminal Code 
which are punishable by five or more years imprisonment, and offences under ss. 3 to 20 of
the Small Loans Act, for which there are grounds to believe there is a
pattern of criminal activity carried on by persons in concert.  The relevant Code
sections read as follows:

 

178.11 [now 184]  (1)  Every one who, by means
of an electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device, wilfully
intercepts a private communication is guilty of an indictable offence and
liable to imprisonment for five years.

 

(2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to

 

(a) a person who has the consent
to intercept, express or implied, of the originator of the private
communication or of the person intended by the originator thereof to receive
it;

 

(b) a person who intercepts a
private communication in accordance with an authorization or any person who in
good faith aids in any way a person whom he has reasonable and probable grounds
to believe is acting with any such authorization;

 

                                                                        . . .

 

178.12 [now 185]  (1)  An application for an
authorization shall be made ex parte and in writing to a judge of a
superior court of criminal jurisdiction, or a judge as defined in section 482
[now 552] and shall be signed by the Attorney General of the province in which
the application is made or the Solicitor General of Canada or an agent
specially designated in writing for the purposes of this section by

 

(a) the Solicitor General of
Canada personally, if the offence under investigation is one in respect of
which proceedings, if any, may be instituted at the instance of the Government
of Canada and conducted by or on the behalf of the Attorney General of Canada,
or

 

(b) the Attorney General of a
province personally, in respect of any other offence in that province,

 

and shall be accompanied by an affidavit
which may be sworn on the information and belief of a peace officer or public
officer deposing to the following matters, namely:

 

(c) the facts relied upon to
justify the belief that an authorization should be given together with
particulars of the offence;

 

(d) the type of private
communication proposed to be intercepted;

 

(e) the names, addresses and
occupations, if known, of all persons, the interception of whose private
communications there are reasonable and probable grounds to believe may assist
the investigation of the offence, a general description of the nature and
location of the place, if known, at which private communications are proposed
to be intercepted and a general description of the manner of interception
proposed to be used;








(e.1) [now 185(1)(f)]  the
number of instances, if any, on which an application has been made under this
section in relation to the offence and a person named in the affidavit pursuant
to paragraph (e) and on which the application was withdrawn or no authorization
was given, the date on which each such application was made and the name of the
judge to whom each such application was made;

 

(f) [now 185(1)(g)]  the
period for which the authorization is requested; and

 

(g) whether other investigative
procedures have been tried and have failed or why it appears they are unlikely
to succeed or that the urgency of the matter is such that it would be
impractical to carry out the investigation of the offence using only other
investigative procedures.

 

                                                                        . . . 

 

178.13  [now 186]  (1)  An authorization may be
given if the judge to whom the application is made is satisfied

 

(a) that it would be in the best
interests of the administration of justice to do so; and

 

(b) that other investigative
procedures have been tried and have failed, other investigative procedures are
unlikely to succeed or the urgency of the matter is such that it would be
impractical to carry out the investigation of the offence using only other
investigative procedures.

 

(1.1)  [now 186(2)]  No
authorization may be given to intercept a private communication at the office
or residence of a solicitor, or at any other place ordinarily used by a
solicitor and by other solicitors for the purpose of consultation with clients,
unless the judge to whom the application is made is satisfied that there are
reasonable grounds to believe that the solicitor, any other solicitor
practising with him, any person employed by him or any other such solicitor or
a member of the solicitor's household has been or is about to become a party to
an offence.

 

(1.2)  [now 186(3)]  Where
an authorization is given in relation to the interception of private
communications at a place described in subsection (1.1), the judge by whom the
authorization is given shall include therein such terms and conditions as he
considers advisable to protect privileged communications between solicitors and
clients.

 

(2)  [now 186(4)]  An
authorization shall

 

(a) state the offence in respect
of which private communications may be intercepted;

 

(b) state the type of private
communication that may be intercepted;

 

(c) state the identity of the
persons, if known, whose private communications are to be intercepted,
generally describe the place at which private communications may be
intercepted, if a general description of that place can be given, and generally
describe the manner of interception that may be used;








(d) contain such terms and
conditions as the judge considers advisable in the public interest; and

 

(e) be valid for the period, not
exceeding sixty days, set forth therein.

 

(2.1) [now
186(5)]  The Solicitor General of Canada or the Attorney General, as the case
may be, may designate a person or persons who may intercept private
communications under authorizations.

 

Subsections (3) and (4) (now 185(6) and
(7)) concern renewals of authorizations.

 

178.14 [now 187] (1) All documents relating to
an application made pursuant to section 178.12 or subsection 178.13(3) or
178.23(3) are confidential and, with the exception of the authorization, shall
be placed in a packet and sealed by the judge to whom the application is made
immediately upon determination of such application, and such packet shall be
kept in the custody of the court in a place to which the public has no access
or in such other place as the judge may authorize and shall not be

 

(a) opened or the
content thereof removed except

 

(i) for the purpose of dealing with an
application for renewal of the authorization, or

 

(ii) pursuant to an order of a judge of a
superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as defined in section 482;
and

 

(b) destroyed except pursuant to
an order of a judge referred to in subparagraph (a)(ii).

 

(2) An
order under subsection (1) may only be made after the Attorney General or the
Solicitor General by whom or on whose authority the application was made for
the authorization to which the order relates has been given an opportunity to
be heard.

 

Section 178.15 (now 188) deals with
authorizations granted in emergency situations.

 

178.16 [now 189] (1) A private communication
that has been intercepted is inadmissible as evidence against the originator of
the communication or by the person intended by the originator to receive it
unless

 

(a) the interception was lawfully
made; or 

 

(b) the originator thereof or the
person intended by the originator to receive it has expressly consented to the
admission thereof;








but evidence obtained directly or
indirectly as a result of information acquired by interception of a private
communication is not inadmissible by reason only that the private communication
is itself inadmissible as evidence.

 

 

(2) Notwithstanding
subsection (1), the judge or magistrate presiding at any proceedings may refuse
to admit evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of information
acquired by interception of a private communication that is itself inadmissible
as evidence where he is of the opinion that the admission thereof would bring
the administration of justice into disrepute.

 

(3) Where the judge or
magistrate presiding at any proceedings is of the opinion that a private
communication that, by virtue of subsection (1), is inadmissible as evidence in
the proceedings

 

(a) is relevant to a
matter at issue in the proceedings, and

 

(b) is inadmissible as evidence
therein by reason only of a defect of form or an irregularity in procedure, not
being a substantive defect or irregularity, in the application for or the
giving of the authorization under which such private communication was
intercepted,

 

he may, notwithstanding subsection (1),
admit such private communication as evidence in the proceedings.

 

(3.1) [now 189(4)] A
private communication that has been intercepted and that is admissible as
evidence may be admitted in any criminal proceeding or in any civil proceeding
or other matter whatever respecting which the Parliament of Canada has
jurisdiction, whether or not the criminal proceeding or the civil proceeding or
other matter relates to the offence specified in the authorization pursuant to
which the communication was intercepted.

 

(4) [now 189(5)] A private
communication that has been lawfully intercepted shall not be received in
evidence unless the party intending to adduce it has given to the accused
reasonable notice of his intention together with

 

(a) a transcript of the private
communication, where it will be adduced in the form of a recording, or a statement
setting forth full particulars of the private communication, where evidence of
the private communication will be given viva voce: and

 

(b) a statement respecting the
time, place, and date of the private communication and the parties thereto, if
known.

 

(5) [now
189(6)] Any information obtained by an interception that, but for the
interception would have been privileged, remains privileged and inadmissible as
evidence without the consent of the person enjoying the privilege.

 








Section 178.17 (now 190) provides that a
judge of the court in which a trial is being or is to be held may order further
particulars of the private communication intended to be adduced.  Section
178.18 (now 191) creates an offence for possessing, selling, or purchasing a
device which is primarily useful for surreptitious interception of private
communications, and creates exceptions for use of such devices in law
enforcement. Section 178.19 (now 192) provides for the forfeiture of the
interception devices in addition to any punishment imposed for a conviction
under ss. 178.11 or 178.18.  Section 178.2 (now 192) creates
an offence for the wilful use or disclosure of contents of intercepted
communications without the consent of the originator or the intended receiver,
except in specified situations in legal proceedings and law enforcement. 
Section 178.21 (now 194) empowers a court to exact punitive damages, upon
application of the person aggrieved, from a person convicted under s. 178.11 or
178.2.  Section 178.22 provides that the Solicitor General of Canada shall
prepare each year a statistical report of authorizations obtained for the
year.  Section 178.23 (now 196) sets out notice requirements above and beyond
s. 178.16(4), such that after a certain period after an authorization or
renewal is granted or after an investigation is over, persons subject to
interception are informed of the interception of their private communications.

 

Points in Issue

 

The appellant lists twelve
points in issue but they may be summarized as follows:

 

1.                     What
is the entitlement of an accused person to the sealed packet?

 

2.                     Upon
what grounds may an accused challenge an authorization for wiretap and before
what court?

 








3.                     What
remedy is appropriate?

 

4.                     What
special requirements apply when information from informants is relied on to
obtain an authorization?

 

5.                     What
principles and procedures apply to the editing of the contents of the sealed
packet?

 

6.                     Is
the accused entitled to cross-examination on the affidavit filed with the
authorizing judge?

 

7.                     Did
the failure of the authorizing judge to include a minimization clause result in
the authorization of an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of s. 8  of
the Charter ?

 

8.                     Did
the accused abscond?

 

9.                     Did
the trial judge properly caution the jury with respect to the evidence of
accomplices?

 

Points 2, 3 and 4 all relate to the
sufficiency of the affidavits in satisfying the prerequisites to a valid
authorization.

 

1.  What is the entitlement of an
accused person to the sealed packet?

 








The trial judge refused to
order access based on the restricted access cases.  For the reasons that I gave
in Dersch, those cases no longer apply in view of ss. 7  and 8  of
the Charter .  The accused is entitled to have the packet opened and,
subject to editing, to have its contents produced in order to enable him or her
to make full answer and defence.  The Court of Appeal was, therefore, right in
opening the sealed packets.

 

2. Upon
what grounds may an accused challenge an authorization for wiretap and before
what court?

 

Minimum Statutory and Constitutional
Requirements

 

Section 178.13(1) sets out
the statutory conditions of which a judge must be satisfied before an
authorization is issued:

 

178.13 (1) An authorization may be given if the
judge to whom the application is made is satisfied

 

(a) that it would be in the best
interests of the administration of justice to do so; and

 

(b) that other
investigative procedures have been tried and have failed, other investigative
procedures are unlikely to succeed or the urgency of the matter is such that it
would be impractical to carry out the investigation of the offence using only
other investigative procedures.

 








In R. v. Duarte,
[1990] 1 S.C.R. 30, a majority of this Court held that wiretaps constitute a
search or seizure within the meaning of s. 8  of the Charter .  The statutory
provisions authorizing them must, therefore, conform to the minimum
constitutional requirements demanded by s. 8  of the Charter .  These are set
out by Dickson J. (as he then was) in Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2
S.C.R. 145, as ""reasonable and probable grounds, established upon oath, to
believe that an offence has been committed and that there is evidence to be
found at the place of the search"" (p. 168).  Since wiretaps are considered
to be more intrusive on the privacy of individuals than searches of premises,
there is no reason to consider applying lesser minimum requirements to them. 
In addition, the applicant must meet the requirements of para. (b) of s.
178.13(1)  with respect to other investigative procedures.

 

In R. v. Finlay and
Grellette (1985), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 48 (Ont. C.A.), s. 178.13 was attacked on the ground that
its prerequisites did not comply with the dictates of s. 8 .  Martin J.A., of
the Ontario Court of Appeal, held that the section was constitutional and met
the requirements of s. 8  of the Charter .

 

This conclusion was affirmed
by La Forest J. in R. v. Duarte, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30.  Speaking for the
majority, he stated, at p. 45:

 

A judge must be satisfied that other
investigative methods would fail, or have little likelihood of success, and
that the granting of the authorization is in the best interest of the
administration of justice.  I share the approach of Martin J.A. in R. v.
Finlay and Grellette, supra, at pp. 70 et seq., that this
latter prerequisite imports as a minimum requirement that the issuing judge
must be satisfied that there are reasonable and probable grounds to believe that
an offence has been, or is being, committed and that the authorization sought
will afford evidence of that offence.  It can, I think, be seen that the
provisions and safeguards of Part IV.1 of the Code have been designed to
prevent the agencies of the state from intercepting private communications on
the basis of mere suspicion. 

 

In
proceeding in this fashion, Parliament has, in my view, succeeded in striking
an appropriate balance.  It meets the high standard of the Charter  which
guarantees the right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure by
subjecting the power of the state to record our private communications to
external restraint and requiring it to be justified by application of an objective
criterion.

 

The result is that the
statutory requirements of s. 178.13(1)(a) are identical to the
constitutional requirements.  An authorizing judge must, therefore, be
satisfied on the basis of the affidavit evidence that these conditions have been
met.

 








Challenging the Authorization

 

The current state of the law
with respect to testing the admissibility of wiretap evidence is a procedural
quagmire.  The various procedures that are available have come to be known by
the names of the cases that initiated them.

 

First there is a ""Parsons
voir dire,"" named after R. v. Parsons (1977), 37 C.C.C. (2d)
497 (Ont. C.A.), aff'd [1980] 1 S.C.R. 785, sub nom. Charette v. The
Queen.  The function of this hearing before the trial judge is to determine
such issues as whether the authorization is valid on its face, whether the
police executed the interception within the terms of the authorization, and
whether statutory requirements such as reasonable notice were complied with. 
The remedy is exclusion under s. 178.16.  The second is the ""Wilson
application"".  This hearing takes place before the issuing court, to
determine the substantive or subfacial validity of the affidavit.  The remedy
is the setting aside of the authorization.  The third is a ""Garofoli
hearing"".  This is a hearing before the trial judge to determine the
compliance of the authorization with s. 8  of the Charter .  The remedy is a
determination under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  The fourth, and last,
procedure is a ""Vanweenan hearing"", so-called after one of the
appellants in R. v. Chesson, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 148.  This again is a voir
dire before the trial judge, but with the object of determining whether the
authorization names all ""known"" persons as required by ss. 178.12(1) (e)
and 178.13(2) (c).  The remedy again is exclusion under s. 178.16 . 

 








Consolidation of the Parsons,
Garofoli and Vanweenan hearings presents no difficulty, and is in
keeping with the view of this Court that all matters that relate to the conduct
of the trial should be dealt with by the trial judge.  A more difficult
question arises with respect to the Wilson and Garofoli
applications.  It would be highly desirable if they could be dealt with by the
trial judge so that all aspects of the admissibility of evidence obtained
pursuant to an authorization could be dealt with at one time and at trial. 
Whether this can be done requires an examination of this Court's judgment in Wilson
v. The Queen, supra, and the effects of s. 8  of the Charter  on its application.

 

Wilson, supra, concerned authorizations,
granted by the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench, which were valid on their face
and for which the sealed packets were not opened.  The trial judge (Provincial
Court) held wiretap evidence inadmissible on the basis of evidence, brought out
in cross-examination of the deponent of the affidavit, which conflicted with
the statutory requirement of showing that other investigative methods had
failed or were likely to fail.   The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial.  This
decision was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Court was unanimous in
the result, but McIntyre J. (Laskin C.J. and Estey J. concurring) and Dickson J. (as he then
was, Chouinard J. concurring) gave rather different reasons.

 

McIntyre J. held that a court
order stands unless it is set aside on appeal, or is lawfully quashed.  In the
case of wiretaps the Criminal Code  gives no right of appeal, and there
is no possibility of quashing by writ of certiorari because there is no
issue of jurisdiction.  The general rule is that a court order is immune from
collateral attack, that is, an attack in proceedings other than those the
object of which is the variation of the court order.  In this case, the trial
judge's ruling amounted to a collateral attack on the order of a (superior)
court.  The trial judge's ruling should be limited to defects or irregularities
on the face of the authorization.  Any substantive review of an authorization
must be undertaken by the judge (or court) which issued the order.  McIntyre J.
supported this view by analogy to civil cases holding that an issuing court has
power to conduct inter partes review of its ex parte orders.  In
such a case the court may rescind the order if the facts upon which the
authorization was granted are different from the facts as proved on an inter
partes review.








Dickson J. held that a trial
judge can look behind a facially valid authorization, but in this case did so
improperly because he did not have access to the sealed packet in making his
determination as to the lawfulness of the authorization.  Dickson J. accepted
the general rule against collateral attack, but held that Parliament had
altered it in this case by legislation.  Section 178.16(1) provides that,
absent consent, evidence of a private communication can only be admitted if
lawful.  Section 178.16(3)(b) gives the trial judge discretion to admit
unlawful interceptions if there is a non-substantive defect in the
authorization process.  The corollary is that there is no discretion with
respect to substantive defects.  If the court order were conclusive, there
would be no need for the curative provision of 178.16(3)(b); the trial
judge is thus bound by the legislation to consider if the authorization is
substantively valid.  In so holding, Dickson J. refuted the policy reasons
given for limiting the trial judge to facial review.  He reasoned that the
order of another court could be held unlawful and this would not show
disrespect to that court, but would merely question the evidence upon which
that court based its decision.  He further opined that concern about breaches
of confidentiality could be dealt with by judicial editing.

 

Because the trial judge must
go behind the face of an authorization, Dickson J. held that in most cases it
will be necessary to open the sealed packet.  Dickson J. made no comment on the
cases which create a high barrier before the packet will be opened, for in this
case there was ample evidence of misleading disclosure.  He concluded that the
trial judge could not properly decide whether the interceptions were lawfully
made without examining the contents of the packets.  Dickson J. also held that
in keeping with a substantive review of the authorization, the accused must
have the opportunity to cross-examine the affiant.  The questioning must be
directed to whether the authorization was properly obtained, without the
disclosure of information that ought to be kept confidential.

 








Dickson J. noted that in this
case, the trial judge was not among the categories specified in s. 178.14 and
therefore was not himself authorized to open the packet.  In such a case, the
trial must be adjourned for the accused to apply to the proper court to open
the packet, which it may or may not do in its discretion.  Substantive review
of the authorization, though, lies with the trial judge.

 

This Court was recently
asked, inter alia, to reconsider Wilson, supra, in R.
v. Meltzer, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1764.  McIntyre J., for the Court, made the
following observation, at p. 1771:

 

It has been said that this
has led to a confusion and delay and that the trial judge should, in his
capacity as trial judge, have full power to open the sealed packet and review
the High Court order, regardless of the status of the trial judge, and make any
necessary rulings.  That this procedure would probably expedite matters and
remove some confusion may well be true.  It is not, however, a procedure
provided by Parliament, and subject to arguments relating to the application
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  it is not, in my opinion,
open to the courts to disregard the statutory provisions of Part IV.1 of the Criminal
Code .  If there is confusion and delay in this matter it arises from
the Criminal Code  itself and, subject as aforesaid, it will be for
Parliament to change.  [Emphasis added.]

 

In the passage cited above,
McIntyre J. acknowledged that the application of the Charter  might have
an effect on the conclusion reached in Wilson.  In my opinion, when it
is asserted by an accused that a wiretap infringes s. 8 , an appropriate review
is incompatible with the restrictions of Wilson.  The judge conducting
the review must hear evidence and submissions as to whether the interception
constitutes an unreasonable search or seizure.  Inasmuch as it is an issue as
to the admissibility of evidence, it may be raised at trial.  Under s. 24 of
the Charter , the trial judge is a court of competent jurisdiction.  In Mills
v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, McIntyre J., speaking of trial courts exercising
criminal jurisdiction other than superior courts, stated, at p. 955:

 








These courts will be courts
of competent jurisdiction, where they have jurisdiction conferred by statute
over the offences and persons and power to make the orders sought.  It is to be
hoped that trial judges will devise, as the circumstances arise, imaginative
remedies to serve the needs of individual cases.  Such remedies must remain,
however, subject to constitutional restraint, that is, they must remain within
the ambit of criminal powers.  A claim for a remedy under s. 24(1)  arising in
the course of the trial will fall within the jurisdiction of these courts as a
necessary incident of the trial process.

 

An objection to the reception
of evidence is very much a necessary incident of the trial process.  A trial
judge before whom wiretap evidence is tendered is obliged to rule on an
objection based on an alleged breach of the accused's constitutional rights. 
He or she has jurisdiction and it cannot be declined.

 

It is true that the procedure
on a Wilson application was to combine an application to open the packet
with an application for review of its contents to determine the legal validity
of the authorization.  This procedure was suggested as the appropriate one in Wilson. 
Nothing in s. 178.14(1)(a)(ii), however, requires that the
review of the contents of the sealed packet be made by the judge designated
therein.  It deals exclusively with the unsealing of the packet and does not
purport to provide for a review of its contents.  The source of review under Wilson
was the general jurisdiction of the courts to set aside their own orders,
either by action in the High Court or by a motion to set aside an ex parte
order.  Resort to this jurisdiction attracted the restrictions inherent in the
exercise of this jurisdiction both with respect to the available grounds and
with respect to collateral attacks on court orders.  These restrictions are
fully explained in Wilson.  The Charter  provides a clear
alternative basis for resort to the court and with it the appropriate grounds
for a determination as to whether there has been a breach of s. 8 .

 








Accordingly, while
applications to open the packet must, by reason of the explicit language of the
section, be made to a judge designated therein, applications for review should
be made to the trial judge.  This will achieve the desirable objective of
leaving all matters relating to the admissibility of wiretap evidence to the
trial judge.

 

Further, it would remove any
doubts as to the right to appeal a decision rejecting or admitting the
evidence.  Martin J.A., in his reasons in this case, expressed concern about
the lack of appeal where an authorization is set aside during a preliminary
hearing.  I would go further and question the right of appeal from the judgment
of the trial judge who admits or rejects the evidence pursuant to the order of
a Wilson judge.  Since the trial judge cannot question the decision made
on the Wilson application, I fail to see how it can be shown that the
trial judge committed any error in accepting it.  Martin J.A. refers to R.
v. Bailey (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 21 (Ont. C.A.), and R. v. Banas and
Haverkamp (1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 224 (Ont. C.A.), for the proposition that
an appeal lies from an acquittal.  Those cases did not involve a Wilson
application, and in each case there was a decision made by the trial judge with
respect to the admissibility of evidence which could be the subject of attack
on the basis of an error of law.  In R. v. Bailey, supra, Morden
J.A. stated the test for an appeal from an acquittal as follows, at p. 24:

 

To succeed
on an appeal from an acquittal under s. 613(4)  of the Criminal Code  the
Crown must satisfy the appellate court that the trial judge erred and that the
result would not necessarily have been the same if he had not so erred:  R.
v. McMillan (1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 160, 7 O.R. (2d) 750, 20 C.R.N.S. 191,
and Vezeau v. The Queen (1976), 28 C.C.C. (2d) 81, 66 D.L.R. (3d) 418,
[1977] 2 S.C.R. 277.

 

The language of s. 178.14
(now s. 187) will continue to require an application to open before a judge
referred to therein.  In some cases, this will not be the trial judge.  I have
referred in Dersch to the desirability of a legislative amendment to
enable the trial judge to order the opening of the packet.

 








Grounds for Review

 

In R. v. Collins,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, Lamer J. (as he then was) set out the basic test for
determining the reasonableness of a search under s. 8  of the Charter .  He stated, at
p. 278:

 

A search
will be reasonable if it is authorized by law, if the law itself is reasonable
and if the manner in which the search was carried out is reasonable.

 

In Hunter v. Southam, supra,
this Court set out the basic requirements with respect to prior
authorizations.  In Duarte, supra, this Court decided that s.
178.13(1)(a) complies with these standards, and that before granting an
authorization, a judge must be satisfied by affidavit that there are reasonable
and probable grounds to believe that:

 

(a)                   a
specified crime has been or is being committed; and,

 

(b)                   the
interception of the private communication in question will afford evidence of
the crime.

 








To arrive at the conclusion
that the search is authorized by law, the reviewing judge must therefore
conclude that these conditions were complied with.  If he concludes that they
were not, then the search is not authorized by law and is unlawful. 
Consequently, in order to discharge the duty cast upon the reviewing judge to
determine whether there has been a breach of s. 8 , he or she must determine
whether the Code provisions have been satisfied.  This is the inevitable
result of the statutory conditions being identical to the requirements of s.
8 .  Whereas Wilson precluded a review of the authorizing judge's
decision that the statutory conditions had been complied with, unless some
ground such as fraud or new evidence was established, the application of s. 8 
requires review as a step in determining the reasonableness of the search and
seizure.

 

While a judge exercising this
relatively new power need not comply with the Wilson criteria, he should
not review the authorization de novo.  The correct approach is set out
in the reasons of Martin J.A. in this appeal.  He states, at p. 119:

 

If the trial judge
concludes that, on the material before the authorizing judge, there was no
basis upon which he could be satisfied that the pre-conditions for the granting
of the authorization exist, then, it seems to me that the trial judge is
required to find that the search or seizure contravened s. 8  of the Charter .

 

The reviewing judge does not
substitute his or her view for that of the authorizing judge.  If, based on the
record which was before the authorizing judge as amplified on the review, the
reviewing judge concludes that the authorizing judge could have granted the
authorization, then he or she should not interfere.  In this process, the
existence of fraud, non-disclosure, misleading evidence and new evidence are
all relevant, but, rather than being a prerequisite to review, their sole
impact is to determine whether there continues to be any basis for the decision
of the authorizing judge.

 

3.  What remedy is appropriate?

 

Once the reviewing judge
determines that the interception was not lawfully made, he or she has made a
determination in the very language of s. 178.16(1)(a), which provides:

 

178.16 (1) A private communication that has
been intercepted is inadmissible as evidence against the originator of the
communication or the person intended by the originator to receive it unless

 








(a)   the
interception was lawfully made . . . .

 

I must respectfully disagree
with Martin J.A. that the mere fact that the authorization is not set aside
precludes a determination that the interception is not lawfully made.  In his
reasons, he describes the determination of the reviewing judge as follows, at
p. 119:

 

The trial judge, whether or
not he or she is a Supreme Court judge, may, however, without setting aside the
authorization, hold that the statutory pre-conditions for the granting of the
authorization were not met, and hence the interception was unlawful and
resulted in an unreasonable search or seizure within s. 8  of the Charter . 
[Emphasis added.]

 

The mere fact that,
technically, the authorization has not been set aside can have little
significance where its legal underpinnings have been removed.  This degree of
respect for the sanctity of a court order cannot be maintained.  A
determination that the Charter  has been breached and that perhaps
admission of evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute
will have already discredited the authorization to such an extent that I see no
reason for preserving its formal validity purely for the purpose of showing
deference for court orders.  To maintain the validity of orders that have been
undermined by a declaration of illegality by a court would only engender
disrespect for court orders.

 








In the result, a finding that
the interception is unlawful attracts the peremptory language of s. 178.16 and
the evidence is inadmissible.  Section 24(2)  cannot have the effect of making
the evidence admissible even if to do so would not bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.  Section 24(2)  is an exclusionary and not an
inclusionary rule.  It operates to exclude evidence that would otherwise be
admissible where to admit the evidence would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.  Evidence that is inadmissible by reason of some other
exclusionary rule cannot be admitted by invoking s. 24(2) .  Accordingly, an
accused who has invoked the jurisdiction of s. 24 and who establishes as part
of the necessary operation of Charter  review that an interception was
unlawfully obtained is entitled to the benefit of the provisions of s. 178.16 
to have the evidence excluded.

 

4. What
special requirements apply when information from informants is relied on to
obtain an authorization?

 

The appellant submitted that
in order to establish reasonable and probable grounds to justify a search, a
detailed set of requirements was necessary in respect of the use of informants'
information.  He contends that in coming to the conclusion that the affidavits
in this case were sufficient, the Court of Appeal must have applied the
""totality of the circumstances"" test set out in Illinois v. Gates,
462 U.S. 213 (1983).  The pertinent passage from that judgment reads as
follows, at p. 238:

 

The task of the issuing
magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given
all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the
""veracity"" and ""basis of knowledge"" of persons supplying
hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of
a crime will be found in a particular place.

 

The general requirement with
which the authorizing judge must comply has already been referred to in these
reasons.  He or she must be satisfied that the statutory conditions have been
established.  The reviewing judge should not set aside this decision unless he
or she is satisfied on the whole of the material presented that there was no
basis for the authorization.  While this is the general instruction that each
judge should apply, special problems arise with respect to the use of
information of informants.  It is therefore desirable to examine what special
requirements, if any, should be developed to enable judges to apply the general
instruction in a way that strikes a just balance between the needs of law
enforcement and the protection of the rights of privacy.








This issue has been addressed
by this Court in connection with the use of informant information to support a
warrantless search.

 

In R. v. Debot, [1989]
2 S.C.R. 1140, police officers acting on the information of an informer stopped
and detained the appellant's motor vehicle and conducted, without warrant, a
search of the vehicle and the persons of the appellant and others.  In
assessing the weight to be given to the evidence relied on by the police
officer, Wilson J. applied ""the totality of the circumstances""
standard which had been applied by Martin J.A. in the Court of Appeal.  On this
basis, Wilson J. found that there were reasonable and probable grounds to
justify the search.  This conclusion was concurred in by the other members of
the Court.

 

In R. v. Greffe,
[1990] 1 S.C.R. 755, the Crown conceded that in conducting a rectal search,
there had been a violation of ss. 8  and 10  of the Charter .  The parties
differed, however, in characterizing the seriousness of the violation for the
purpose of determining admissibility under s. 24(2) .  Lamer J. (as he then was)
considered that ""the core difference centres on whether the police had
reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the appellant was in
possession, and therefore trying to import into Canada, an illegal
narcotic"" (p. 788).

 

The only evidence on the
record was testimony that on the basis of ""confidential information
received and background investigation"" the officer had ""grounds to
believe . . . that he [Greffe] was going to be in possession of an unknown
amount of heroin"".  Lamer J. held that the trial judge erred in concluding
that the police had confidential and reliable information by reason of
the eventual recovery of the heroin.  He wrote, at p. 790:

 








It was incumbent upon the Crown to
establish at trial, if it could, the basis upon which the police claimed to
have reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the appellant was in
possession of the heroin.  This would have been done through an inquiry into
the source and reliability of the ""confidential information"" in the
possession of the police.

 

                                                                         .
. .

 

What should have happened is
that the police should have been asked at trial about the confidential
information to determine if, in the totality of the circumstances, there
existed reasonable and probable grounds to believe the accused was carrying the
heroin.  [Emphasis added.] 

 

Lamer J. also referred with approval
to the following passage from Martin J.A.'s judgment in R. v. Debot
(1986), 30 C.C.C. (3d) 207 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 218-19, as the test for
assessing confidential informer's information:

 

I am of the view that such a
mere conclusory statement made by an informer to a police officer would not
constitute reasonable grounds for conducting a warrantless search. . . . 
Highly relevant . . . are whether the informer's ""tip"" contains sufficient
detail to ensure it is based on more than mere rumour or gossip, whether the
informer discloses his or her source or means of knowledge and whether there
are any indicia of his or her reliability, such as the supplying of
reliable information in the past or confirmation of part of his or her story by
police surveillance.

 

Although Greffe
concerns admissibility under s. 24(2) , in my opinion the discussion has a
bearing on the sort of information that must be put before a judge issuing an
authorization for electronic surveillance.  I see no difference between
evidence of reliability of an informant tendered to establish reasonable and
probable grounds to justify a warrantless search (the issue in the cases cited
by Lamer J.) and evidence of reliability of an informant tendered to establish
similar grounds in respect of a wiretap authorization.  Moreover, I conclude
that the following propositions can be regarded as having been accepted by this
Court in Debot and Greffe.

 

(i)                     Hearsay
statements of an informant can provide reasonable and probable grounds to
justify a search.  However, evidence of a tip from an informer, by itself, is
insufficient to establish reasonable and probable grounds.








(ii)                    The
reliability of the tip is to be assessed by recourse to ""the totality of
the circumstances"".  There is no formulaic test as to what this entails. 
Rather, the court must look to a variety of factors including:

 

(a)  the degree of detail of
the ""tip"";

 

(b)  the informer's source of
knowledge;

 

(c)   indicia
of the informer's reliability such as past performance or confirmation from
other investigative sources.

 

(iii)  The results of the
search cannot, ex post facto, provide evidence of reliability of the
information.

 

Conclusion on Issues 2, 3 and 4

 

While I have differed
somewhat with the reasons of Martin J.A. with respect to issues 2 and 3, I am
in agreement with the result reached by him that the affidavits were sufficient
on their face.  He concludes his reasons as follows, at pp. 129-30:

 

I am satisfied
that the affidavits set out ample facts upon which the authorizing judges could
be satisfied that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the specified
offences were being or had been committed, that the interceptions sought would
afford evidence of the offences, that other investigative procedures were
unlikely to succeed and that it would be in the best interests of the
administration of justice to grant the authorizations.

 

5. What
principles and procedures apply to the editing of the contents of the sealed
packet?








The appellant does not take
issue with the exercise by the Court of Appeal of the power to edit the
affidavit in order to preserve the identity of informants.  His principal
submission is that the appellant should be provided with judicially approved
summaries of the edited words and phrases.

 

The power to edit clearly
exists and derives from the supervisory and protecting power which a court
possesses over its own records:  Attorney General of Nova Scotia v.
MacIntyre, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 175, at p. 189.

 

In determining the procedure
to be followed in editing the materials in the packet, regard must be had for
the competing interests of law enforcement, and in particular the protection of
the identity of informers and investigative techniques, on the one hand and the
right of the accused to make full answer and defence on the other.  The
following observations of Dickson J. in MacIntyre, supra, at pp.
180 and 184, are apt:

 

As is often the case in a
free society there are at work two conflicting public interests.  The one has
to do with civil liberties and the protection of the individual from
interference with the enjoyment of his property.  There is a clear and
important social value in avoidance of arbitrary searches and unlawful
seizures.  The other, competing, interest lies in the effective detection and
proof of crime and the prompt apprehension and conviction of offenders.  Public
protection, afforded by efficient and effective law enforcement, is enhanced
through the proper use of search warrants.

 

                                                                         .
. .

 

In short,
what should be sought is maximum accountability and accessibility but not to
the extent of harming the innocent or of impairing the efficiency of the search
warrant as a weapon in society's never-ending fight against crime.

 








Judicial editing appears to
be the rule in every province except British Columbia.  In Dersch v. Canada
(Attorney General) (1987), 17 B.C.L.R. (2d) 145, Esson J.A.
expressed the view that editing constituted judicial legislation.  This
statement was made in the context of his reasons supporting restricted access
to the sealed packet.  In Dersch, I have determined that the restricted
access cases are no longer sound.  Editing, therefore, is essential in cases in
which confidential information is included in the affidavit filed in support of
an authorization.  In determining what to edit, the judge will have regard for
the rule against disclosure of police informants.  The most recent expression
of the rule by this Court is in the case of Bisaillon v. Keable, [1983]
2 S.C.R. 60.  Beetz J. stated, at p. 93:

 

It follows
from these reasons that at common law the secrecy rule regarding police
informers' identity has chiefly taken the form of rules of evidence based on
the public interest, which prohibit judicial disclosure of police informers'
identity by peace officers who have learned the informers' identity in the
course of their duties.  A witness also may not be compelled to state whether
he is himself a police informer.  The rule was developed in criminal
proceedings, apparently in trials for high treason, but it also applies in
civil matters, and in both cases it has been established for reasons which
relate to the essential effectiveness of the criminal law.  The rule is subject
to only one exception, imposed by the need to demonstrate the innocence of an
accused person.  There are no exceptions in proceedings other than criminal. 
Its application does not depend on the judge's discretion, as it is a legal
rule of public order by which the judge is bound. 

 

The identity of informers is
generally not relevant.  When a trial judge is engaged in the editing process,
he or she must consider the ""innocence at stake"" exception.  In Re
Rideout and The Queen (1986), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 211 (Nfld. S.C.), Goodridge J.
took the following view of the exception, at p. 220:

 

The rule
against the identification of police informants is only made possible because,
in almost every case, it will not be relevant. . . .  Where it is relevant, it
will be admitted for that was the one exception mentioned by Beetz J. in the
passage set forth above -- the situation where disclosure was needed to
demonstrate the innocence of an accused person.

 

In Roviaro v. United
States, 353 U.S. 53 (7th Cir. 1957), Justice Burton wrote, at pp. 60-61:

 








Where the disclosure of an
informer's identity, or of the contents of his communication, is relevant and
helpful to the defence of an accused, or is essential to a fair determination
of a cause, the privilege must give way.  In these situations the trial court
may require disclosure and, if the Government withholds the information,
dismiss the action.

 

In Re Chambers and The
Queen (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 440 (Ont. C.A.), Martin J.A.
pointed out that the exception was ""more likely to apply where the
informer is a witness to material facts"" (p. 451).

 

The determination in each
case will require the balancing of the relevance of the identity of the
informer to the accused's case against the prejudice to the informer and to the
public interest in law enforcement which disclosure would occasion.  The issue
does not arise in this appeal since it is not contended that the identity of
the informer is relevant.  It is undesirable, therefore, to delve further into
the process of weighing these interests in determining whether an exception has
been made out.  Suffice it to say that it is very much a determination to be
made by the trial judge.

 

The question remains as to
the extent of editing and the procedure to be followed.  Since there will be
more than one method of striking a proper balance between the interests of law
enforcement and of the right to make full answer and defence, I would not wish
to place trial judges in a ""strait-jacket"" by laying down iron-clad
rules with respect to editing.  In deciding what to edit, the following factors
outlined by Watt J. in R. v. Parmar (1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 260
(Ont. H.C.), at pp. 281-82, commend themselves to me:

 

(a)                   whether
the identities of confidential police informants, and consequently their lives
and safety, may be compromised, bearing in mind that such disclosure may occur
as much by reference to the nature of the information supplied by the
confidential source as by the publication of his or her name;

 








(b)                   whether
the nature and extent of ongoing law enforcement investigations would thereby be
compromised;

 

(c)                    whether
disclosure would reveal particular intelligence-gathering techniques thereby
endangering those engaged therein and prejudicing future investigation of
similar offences and the public interest in law enforcement and crime detection,
and

 

(d)                   whether
the disclosure would prejudice the interests of innocent persons.

 

I have examined the procedure
followed in Parmar, approved in R. v. Rowbotham (1988), 41 C.C.C.
(3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), and the procedure followed by the Court of Appeal in this
case.  The following outline is the procedure which, in my view, should be
followed.  It is not intended to be exclusive or exhaustive.

 

1.                     Upon
opening of the packet, if the Crown objects to disclosure of any of the
material, an application should be made by the Crown suggesting the nature of
the matters to be edited and the basis therefor.  Only Crown counsel will have
the affidavit at this point.

 

2. The trial judge should
then edit the affidavit as proposed by Crown counsel and furnish a copy as
edited to counsel for the accused.  Submissions should then be entertained from
counsel for the accused.  If the trial judge is of the view that counsel for
the accused will not be able to appreciate the nature of the deletions from the
submissions of Crown counsel and the edited affidavit, a form of judicial
summary as to the general nature of the deletions should be provided.

 

3.                     After
hearing counsel for the accused and reply from the Crown, the trial judge
should make a final determination as to editing, bearing in mind that editing
is to be kept to a minimum and applying the factors listed above.

 








4.                     After
the determination has been made in (3), the packet material should be provided
to the accused.

 

5. If the Crown can support
the authorization on the basis of the material as edited, the authorization is
confirmed.

 

6. If, however, the editing
renders the authorization insupportable, then the Crown may apply to have the
trial judge consider so much of the excised material as is necessary to support
the authorization.  The trial judge should accede to such a request only if
satisfied that the accused is sufficiently aware of the nature of the excised
material to challenge it in argument or by evidence.  In this regard, a
judicial summary of the excised material should be provided if it will fulfill
that function.  It goes without saying that if the Crown is dissatisfied with
the extent of disclosure and is of the view that the public interest will be
prejudiced, it can withdraw tender of the wiretap evidence.

 

In this case, the Court of
Appeal was in substantial compliance with the procedures outlined above.  The
process stopped after step (5).  No issue can be taken with respect to the
procedure followed.

 

6. Is
the accused entitled to cross-examination on the affidavit filed with the
authorizing judge?

 








The appellant asserts a right
to cross-examine the affiant on the affidavits filed in support of the
authorization.  Specifically, he seeks to attack the statement made by the
affiant that he (the affiant) received information from an informer, who had
proved reliable in the past, and that in the month of December 1982 Garofoli
and Criminisi had approached . . . (edited) with an offer to supply him with
two kilograms of cocaine to sell for them.  He filed two affidavits, his own
and that of his former counsel.  The substance of the affidavits is described
in the reasons of Martin J.A. as follows, at p. 130:

 

Garofoli's affidavit states
that he lived in Florida from September, 1977 up to August, 1983, when he
returned to Hamilton to live.  He was charged in Hamilton with certain offences
of fraud and conspiracy to defraud, and he states in his affidavit that the
only occasions on which he was in Hamilton, or even in Ontario, until he
returned to Hamilton to live in August, 1983, were in connection with court
appearances on those charges.  He states that the only occasions on which he
was in Hamilton during the latter part of 1982 or the early part of 1983 were
in connection with court appearances on November 3, 1982, January 14, 1983, and
on certain dates in February, March, April and May, 1983.  He states that the
allegation contained in Officer Campbell's affidavit, sworn on September 29,
1983, that some person was approached by Garofoli and Criminisi in December,
1982 with a proposal that this individual sell cocaine for them, is totally
false, that he was not in Hamilton in the month of December, 1982, nor did he
see or meet with Criminisi during any of his visits to Hamilton in connection
with court appearances.  He further states that the officer in charge of the
fraud and conspiracy case was well aware that he was living in Florida and
travelled to Hamilton only in connection with his court appearances, and that
if Officer Campbell had made any inquiries he would readily have been aware
that he was living in Florida during December, 1982.

 

The Court of Appeal refused
cross-examination on the ground that accepting these affidavits as true, they
did not establish that the affiant Campbell had ""made a false statement in
his affidavit knowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard for its
truth"".

 

These preconditions for
cross-examination of the affiant are based largely on the American case of Franks
v. Delaware, supra.  They were adopted by the Court of Appeal in Re
Church of Scientology and The Queen (No. 6) (1987), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (and
in Rowbotham, supra).  Most recently, they were upheld by Watt J. in R.
v. Parmar (1987), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 300, where Watt J. stated them to be as follows, at p.
344:

 

(i)                            there
must be specific allegation(s) of deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard
for the truth in respect of specific aspects of the supportive affidavit;








(ii)                           there
must be prima facie proof by the applicant in admissible form, of the
substance of what is alleged to controvert the specific contents of the
affidavit, and

 

(iii)                   it
must be made to appear that, if the material impugned as false or in reckless
regard of the truth is set aside, that which remains is insufficient to sustain
the issuance of the impugned order under s. 178.13(1) or 178.13(4), as the case may
be.

 

In my opinion, these preconditions are
subject to the same criticisms that were levelled at the preconditions for the
sealed packet imposed by the restricted access cases.  In R. v. Playford,
supra, Goodman J.A. stated, at p. 178:

 

. . . he cannot gain access
to the affidavit unless he can prove on a prima facie basis the grounds
for such access and he cannot prove such grounds unless he has access.

 

And in Finlay and Grellette, supra,
Martin J.A. stated, at p. 77:

 

Counsel
for the appellants stated that in consequence of the restriction placed on an
accused's access to the sealed packet, the accused finds himself in an impossible
situation.  To ascertain whether there has been fraud or non-disclosure he
requires access to the sealed packet, but he cannot gain access to the sealed
packet unless he proves fraud or non-disclosure.

 

Applying that statement to this
situation, the appellant cannot cross-examine unless he provides proof of
deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth, and he cannot
establish deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth unless he can
cross-examine.

 








Furthermore, I question the
utility of cross-examination if the accused can establish, even on a prima
facie basis, deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for truth.  Except
on television, most cross-examiners would consider a cross-examination to have
succeeded marvelously if the result is a prima facie case that the
affiant has been deliberately false or reckless.  If this can be made out ab
extra, there is no need to cross-examine.

 

This Court has consistently
demonstrated a policy to uphold the right to cross-examine.  In Innisfil
(Corporation of the Township) v. Corporation of the Township of Vespra,
[1981] 2 S.C.R. 145, the right was maintained with respect to evidence of
government policy before an administrative tribunal.  See also R. v. Potvin,
[1989] 1 S.C.R. 525.  In Wilson, supra, Dickson J.,
speaking for himself and Chouinard J., approved of the right to
cross-examine on an affidavit filed in support of an authorization.  He stated,
at p. 624:

 

It is of little avail to
defence counsel to have a statement of law that an authorization can be held to
be invalid if obtained, for example, by material non-disclosure and then
preclude counsel from asking questions tending to show there has in fact been
non-disclosure.

 

Although McIntyre J. did not
deal explicitly with the point, he did not disagree with this statement. 
Furthermore, in accepting the jurisprudence with respect to review of ex
parte orders, he must have adopted the right to cross-examination which is
inherent in such review.  For example, in Gulf Islands Navigation Ltd. v.
Seafarers' International Union of North American (Canadian District)
(1959), 18 D.L.R. (2d) 625 (B.C.C.A.), the court stated:  ""if the second
Judge hears the motion, he should hear it de novo as to both the law and
facts involved"" (p. 627).

 








In my opinion, the
preconditions in Franks v. Delaware, supra, are too restrictive. 
I believe that they are inconsistent with the approach which we have taken in
Canada with respect to the right to cross-examine.  Moreover, subject to the
protection of the identity of informants and the concern with respect to the
prolongation of proceedings, I see no reason for such a drastic curtailment of
the right.  I believe these concerns can be accommodated without imposing
restrictions as inhibitive as those in Franks v. Delaware.  With respect
to informants, there is no right to cross-examine them.  The informant is not a
witness and cannot be identified unless the accused brings himself within the
""innocence at stake"" exception.

 

With respect to prolixity, I
am in favour of placing reasonable limitations on the cross-examination.  Leave
must be obtained to cross-examine.  The granting of leave must be left to the
exercise of the discretion of the trial judge.  Leave should be granted when
the trial judge is satisfied that cross-examination is necessary to enable the
accused to make full answer and defence.  A basis must be shown by the accused
for the view that the cross-examination will elicit testimony tending to
discredit the existence of one of the preconditions to the authorization, as
for example the existence of reasonable and probable grounds.

 

When permitted, the
cross-examination should be limited by the trial judge to questions that are
directed to establish that there was no basis upon which the authorization
could have been granted.  The discretion of the trial judge should not be
interfered with on appeal except in cases in which it has not been judicially
exercised.  While leave to cross-examine is not the general rule, it is
justified in these circumstances in order to prevent an abuse of what is
essentially a ruling on the admissibility of evidence.

 








In my opinion, the appellant
has shown a basis for the cross-examination here.  In view of the degree of
reliance by the police on the informant in this case, if the informant is
discredited then the factual basis for the authorization is undermined.  If it
is shown that the informant lied, then it could raise the inference that the
police knew or ought to have known that he lied.  If the police were not
warranted in their belief that the information was true, then the basis for
belief that a crime was to be committed disappears.  Accordingly, the appellant
should have been permitted to cross-examine.  Cross-examination having been
denied, there must be a new trial.

 

7. Did
the failure of the authorizing judge to include a minimization clause result in
the authorization of an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of s. 8 of
the Charter?

 

This issue was not raised
before the Court of Appeal and we do not have the benefit of the decision of
the Court of Appeal.  The appellant's argument before this Court relies on the
fact that the affidavit dated November 23 reports that under the prior
authorization 1000 calls were intercepted on the appellant's telephone line, of
which 49 were considered relevant.  He argues that the authorities were
therefore cognizant of the interception of a high number of irrelevant private
communications.  Therefore, he submits, the failure to impose conditions
minimizing the interception of irrelevant communications is unreasonable and
renders the authorization invalid.

 








The issue of minimization is
fully discussed in my reasons in R. v. Thompson, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000. 
The November 21 authorization is within the limitations described in that
case.  The relevant features of the authorization are as follows.  Paragraph 3
names 13 persons whose private communications may be intercepted.  Paragraph 4
sets out two classes of other persons whose private communications may be
intercepted: (a) other persons at the places set out in para. 6(a)‑(g),
and (b) persons originating calls received by persons mentioned in paras. 3 and 4(a). 
Paragraph 6 describes places at which private communications may be
intercepted.  These are seven particular addresses set out in subparas. (a)‑(g)
(each connected with the named persons in para. 3) and places to which persons set out in
para. 3 are believed on reasonable and probable grounds to resort to, as set
out in subpara. (h).   Paragraph 6(h) has a proviso that
interceptions at public pay telephones shall be accompanied by visual
surveillance to ensure that one of the persons named in para. 3 is using
the pay telephone.

 

The authorization does not
permit the interception of the private communications of anyone, anywhere.  The
persons are limited to thirteen named persons, their interlocutors, and persons
at seven addresses connected with the named persons.  The places are limited to
seven named addresses, and places resorted to by the named persons.

 

The appellant's argument in
this case does not attack the particular terms of the authorization so much as
it attacks the absence of minimizing conditions in light of the high number of
irrelevant interceptions under the September 29 authorization.  In Thompson
I recognized that with any wiretap authorization there is a possibility of
invasion of the rights of innocent third parties.  It is an unfortunate cost of
electronic surveillance, but one that Parliament has judged is justified in
appropriate circumstances in the investigation of serious crime.  Likewise, the
interception of irrelevant conversations, with the resultant invasion of the
privacy of the target and third parties, is an unfortunate cost of electronic
surveillance.  The question is: is the cost so great that it renders the
authorization unreasonable?

 








The circumstances in the case
at bar are that some 950 irrelevant telephone calls from Garofoli's home were
intercepted under the September 29 authorization.  This invasion of privacy is
regrettable, but is at least limited in its effect to persons visiting
Garofoli's home.  This is to be contrasted, for instance, with a public pay
telephone, where the privacy of the public at large is threatened.  It appears
to me that the only feasible method of eliminating the recording of irrelevant
calls on Garofoli's telephone line would have been a requirement of live
monitoring.  Even this method might be ineffective, for the relevance of a
particular conversation cannot necessarily be determined with certainty until
the content of a conversation is considered along with all other information
gathered in an investigation.  Furthermore, relevance cannot always be
determined with certainty by listening, for instance, to the first few words of
a conversation.  Irrelevant calls would still have to be listened to long
enough to determine that they are irrelevant.

 

In Thompson I adopted
the position taken by Martin J.A. in R. v. Finlay and Grellette, supra,
that an absolute requirement of live monitoring in all cases would impose too
heavy a burden on Canadian law enforcement officials.  In my view, while a
requirement of live monitoring or visual confirmation would generally be
appropriate when telephone calls are proposed to be intercepted at public pay
telephones, the same considerations do not apply with respect to the private
residence of a person named in an authorization unless there are special
circumstances calling for live monitoring.  It must be remembered that constant
live monitoring of a private residence can also constitute a serious invasion
of privacy.

 

The presence of special
circumstances must be determined on the basis of what will enable the police to
obtain the evidence with a minimum invasion of privacy.  Thus, if the
information in the possession of the police indicates that the subject visits
the premises only occasionally and for a short duration, this should be
reflected in the extent of the electronic surveillance.  It may require live
monitoring to determine the presence of the target and indeed may be a term in
the authorization.  Wholesale interception of all communication in and out of
the residence in these circumstances will run the risk of being found to be an
unreasonable search and seizure.  On the other hand, if the target is an
occupant and is usually present, other considerations will apply.  Such
information may be lacking initially but will often be available after a period
of electronic surveillance pursuant to a valid authorization.  On renewal, or
application for a new authorization, this information must be utilized to
minimize the invasion of privacy.








The appellant has not
satisfied the Court that this case involves any special considerations.  I therefore
conclude that the authorization is not rendered unreasonable in the absence of
minimizing conditions.  The appeal on this ground must fail.

 

8. Did the accused abscond?

 

I would dismiss the appeal
based on this ground for the reasons given by Martin J.A.

 

9. Did
the trial judge properly caution the jury with respect to the evidence of
accomplices?

 

I would dismiss the appeal
based on this ground for the reasons given by Martin J.A.

 

Disposition

 

I have found that none of the
grounds raised, except the cross-examination issue, is entitled to succeed.  In
my opinion, however, the appellant ought to have been permitted to
cross-examine the affiant on the affidavits and there must therefore be a new
trial.

The reasons of L'Heureux-Dubé and McLachlin
JJ. were delivered by

 








MCLACHLIN J. -- I have read
the reasons of Justice Sopinka in this and the related appeals of Dersch v.
Canada (Attorney General), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000; R. v. Lachance,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 000; and R. v. Zito, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000.  My approach
to the interpretation of Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, leads me to a different conclusion with respect to a number of the
questions presented by these appeals -- a conclusion substantially in accord
with the views expressed by Martin J.A. in the Court of Appeal below: (1988),
41 C.C.C. (3d) 97.

 

The issues on this and the
related appeals relate to the proper forums and procedures for challenging
judicial orders authorizing wiretaps of private conversations.  They involve
both the Criminal Code  and the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms , and engage the values enshrined in each.   Accordingly, I preface
my discussion of the issues with observations concerning the operation of Part
IV.1 of the Criminal Code  and its interaction with the Charter .

 

I.  Part
IV.1 of the Criminal Code  and the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms 

 

Part IV.1 of the Criminal
Code  is the primary source of legislative guidance on the subject of
wiretaps.  It reflects an attempt to reconcile society's interest in the
detection of crime and the proper administration of justice with individual
interests in privacy and a fair trial.  But because state wiretaps raise
concerns with respect to individual liberties, the Charter  also plays a
role in governing the electronic interception of private communications.

 








The purpose of Part IV.1 is
clear from its terms.  Part IV.1 seeks to protect the privacy of individuals
from invasion by electronic monitoring, while preserving the power of the
police to intercept communications, where they have reason to believe that a
crime has been or may be committed and the interception is reasonably
necessary.  The first of these purposes -- the protection of privacy -- is
evidenced by the prohibition in s. 178.11(1) (now s. 184(1)) of the electromagnetic, acoustic,
or mechanical interception of private communications.  The second -- the protection
of the administration of justice -- is evidenced by the following subsection,
which exempts consensual or authorized communications from the prohibition. 
This concern with protection of the administration of justice has two aspects. 
The first is the public interest in securing the prosecution and conviction of
the guilty.  But the legislation also recognizes the importance of fairness to
the accused in providing that only interceptions which have been lawfully
obtained will be received in evidence.

 

The judgment of Parliament is
thus clear.  Privacy is to be protected, but must yield to the higher interest
of the administration of justice where the criteria for obtaining an
authorization are established.  The fairness of the trial process is maintained
in that unlawfully obtained evidence is not admitted.  This is the fundamental
philosophy which should guide the courts when dealing with the electronic
interception of private communications.

 

Given that the electronic
interception of private communications raises questions about individual
privacy and the right to a fair trial, the Charter  also has a role to
play in governing state use of wiretaps.  The powers conferred on the courts by
Part IV.1 must be exercised in conformity with the principles enshrined in the Charter . 
These principles include the protection of individual privacy and the right to
a fair trial, including the right to make full answer and defence -- values
which are complementary to the interests reflected in Part IV.1 of the Code.

 








Having set out the philosophy
which infuses Part IV.1 of the Code and related Charter 
provisions, I turn to the specific provisions of the Code.  Society's
interest in the prevention and detection of crime is served most directly by the
creation of a mechanism pursuant to which law enforcement agencies can obtain
judicial authorization to intercept private communications.  Section 178.13(1) 
sets out the pre-conditions to the granting of an authorization by a judge to
whom such an application is made.  An authorization is only to be given where
the judge is satisfied that it would be in the best interests of the
administration of justice to do so and other investigative procedures are
inadequate to the task.  The power conferred on a judge by this section must be
exercised in conformity with the Charter .  Like Sopinka J., I agree with
Martin J.A. of the Ontario Court of Appeal, who stated in R. v. Finlay and
Grellette (1985), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 48, that s. 178.13(1) (a) should be read so as
to require that a judge granting an authorization be satisfied that there are
reasonable grounds to believe that the specified offence has been or is being
committed, and that evidence of the offence will be obtained by the
interception sought.

 

Apart from this limitation on
a judge's ability to authorize a wiretap, the direct protection for individuals
comes from two sources:  s. 178.16(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code , which states that to be admissible in evidence an electronic
interception must have been ""lawfully made""; and s. 24(2)  of
the Charter , which provides for the exclusion of evidence where the
evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed a Charter  right and it
is established that admission of the evidence would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.  Properly viewed, these two mechanisms, operating
individually and in tandem, respond to individual interests in both privacy and
a fair trial.

 

These protections give rise
to three different applications:

 

(1)  An application to open
the packet;

 

(2)                   An
application to set aside the authorization (the Wilson application);

 

(3)  An application to
exclude the interception from evidence

 








(i) on the ground that the
authorization is invalid on its face or that the interception was not executed
within the terms of the authorization (the Parsons voir dire);

 

(ii) on the ground that the
authorization does not name all ""known"" persons as required by ss. 178.12(1)(e)
and 178.13(2)(c) of the Code (the Vanweenan application);

 

(iii) on the ground that the
authorization fails to comply with the requirements for reasonable search and
seizure under s. 8  of the Charter  (the Garofoli
application).

 

Under present practice, the
first application (to open the packet) must be made before a judge designated
under Part IV.1 of the Code (a superior court judge); the second (to set
aside) must be made to the court which authorized the order (also a superior
court); and the third (to exclude evidence) must be made before the trial judge
(who may be a judge of the provincial court).

 

This case raises issues
concerning applications (1), (2) and (3)(iii). The first concern is the
relationship between application (2), the Wilson application, and the
application on Charter  grounds under (3)(iii), the Garofoli
application.  Since both are ultimately concerned with the admissibility of the
wiretap evidence, can they be consolidated so that the trial judge can deal
with both?  The second concern relates to how the court which ultimately hears
the matter should exercise its powers under Part IV.1 of the Code.  
When should the packet on which the authorization was based be opened?  If
opened, can it be edited?   When should cross-examination of the deponents of
affidavits in the packet be permitted?








I propose to deal with each
of these concerns in turn.

 

II.  Challenging
a Judicially Authorized Interception -- Where Should it Happen?

 

Apart from technical faults
which are dealt with under the Parsons and Vanweenan
applications, the existing jurisprudence suggests two remedies for an accused
seeking to prevent the use at trial of wiretap evidence -- one under the Code
and one under the Charter ; one before a judge of the superior court
which issued the order and one before the trial judge.  My colleague, Sopinka
J., takes the view that the two applications can be consolidated, with the
result that the trial judge, regardless of the court he or she sits on, can
hear both.  I cannot agree.  Notwithstanding the procedural advantages of such
a solution, I do not think it is open to this Court to impose it.

 

I turn first to the Wilson
application to set aside the authorization.  As Martin J.A., of the Ontario
Court of Appeal, explained in his reasons in this case, in order for an accused
to succeed on a Wilson application, there must be evidence of fraud,
material non-disclosure, misleading disclosure or new evidence which shows that
the actual facts are different from those on which the authorization was
granted under s. 178.13.  The result of a successful Wilson
application is that the authorization will be set aside, as if it never
existed, so that any interception made pursuant to it will not have been
lawfully made, and therefore will not be admissible in evidence under s. 178.16(1)(a)
of the Code.

 








The Code does not
expressly provide for the Wilson application, although it contemplates
that judicial authorizations may be set aside. The Wilson application
rests rather on the common law rule that the court which makes an order can
also set it aside.  No other court, except a statutorily empowered court of
appeal, can set the order aside. This rule is known as the rule against
collateral attack.  Applied to the problem before us, it precludes holding that
a provincial court trial judge can set aside an authorization under Part IV.1
(the Wilson application).  That can only be done by a judge of the
superior court which granted the authorization.

 

This is the logic upon which
this Court relied in Wilson v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594, where the
majority held that an authorization which has not been set aside is not subject
to collateral attack and must be given full effect according to its terms.  This
is also the logic upon which this Court relied in unanimously affirming Wilson
in R. v. Meltzer, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1764.  It is based on sound principle
and, in my view, unassailable.   Accordingly, I find myself unable to avoid the
conclusion which it mandates  -- namely, that an application to set aside a
wiretap authorization can be made only to a judge of a superior court
designated under Part IV.1 of the Code and cannot be brought before a
trial judge of a different court.

 








The second source of
protection for the individual interests touched by wiretapping is the Charter . 
The Garofoli review, as it has come to be known from Martin J.A.'s
judgment in this case, involves a determination as to the admissibility of an
electronic interception under s. 8  of the Charter .  That section 8 comes
into play here results from the reasoning in R. v. Finlay and Grellette,
supra, which held that electronic interception of private communications
is a ""search or seizure"" within the meaning of s. 8  of the Charter . 
Given that s. 8  is viewed as, at a minimum, dealing with privacy
concerns, the introduction of s. 8  here adds a second level of protection
for individual privacy, one that supplements the protection already provided
within the Criminal Code .  Pursuant to s. 8 , then, the search or seizure must be
reasonable, which means that it must comport with the minimum s. 8 
requirements set out in Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145. 
Under the Charter , the trial judge, even if not a judge of a superior
court, is competent to determine whether evidence was obtained in contravention
of s. 8 , which, in this context, means determining whether the authorization
was granted so as to meet the pre-conditions in the Code.  As Martin
J.A. explains, the finding that the pre-conditions were not met leaves the
judge with a discretion to exclude the evidence under s. 24(2)  of
the Charter  as a result of a s. 8  breach.

 

This review of the two
general remedies available to exclude wiretap evidence suggests that the two
cannot be conceptually combined and cannot both be brought before a trial judge
unless that judge happens to belong to the superior court which issued the
authorization.  The accused has a legal right to apply to the court which
issued the authorization to wiretap that this Court cannot take away.  No more
can this Court empower a judge of another court to hear such an application, in
contravention of the rule against collateral review.  The Wilson
application to set an authorization aside and the Garofoli application
to reject evidence under the Charter  are conceptually and
jurisprudentially distinct, a fact which this Court is powerless to change.

 








I thus find myself in
agreement with the view taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal that an accused
seeking to exclude evidence of an interception has two remedies:  (1) a Wilson
application to a superior court to set aside the authorization, thereby
rendering the interception not ""lawfully made"" within the terms of s. 178.16(1)(a);
and (2) a Garofoli application before the trial judge (often a
provincial court judge) for exclusion of the intercepted evidence on the ground
that it constitutes an unreasonable search and seizure under s. 8  of the Charter ,
the reception of which in evidence would tend to bring the administration of
justice into disrepute under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  The Wilson
application carries with it a more onerous burden, but that is offset by the
fact that the remedy for a successful applicant is automatic:  the interception
cannot be admitted into evidence.  Under the Charter , the accused faces
a less substantial burden, but the remedy is not automatic; it is based on s. 24(2)  of
the Charter  which is necessarily flexible in that it must deal with a
variety of circumstances.

 

It is necessary to add a
comment on the question of what is meant by a ""lawfully made""
interception in s. 178.16(1)(a), since it impacts on when
evidence becomes inadmissible under a Wilson application. Two views are
possible in this regard.  The first is that of Martin J.A. in the judgment
below.  On this view, any interception obtained pursuant to an authorization,
which has not been set aside, is lawful and hence admissible under Part IV.1. 
It may, however, be excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter  if it was
obtained in breach of the accused's rights under s. 8  of the Charter  and its use would
tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  The second view is
that of Sopinka J.  It holds that an authorized interception may be unlawful if
it was obtained in circumstances where an authorization should not have been
granted.

 

In my view, the governing
consideration must be the intention of Parliament.  What did it intend
""lawfully made"" to mean?  I share Martin J.A.'s view that Parliament meant an
interception made pursuant to a subsisting authorization.  To hold that conduct
expressly authorized by a court order is unlawful runs contrary to our most
fundamental notions of lawfulness.  If a person armed with such an order cannot
assume he or she is acting lawfully, who can?

 








It may be that the order
pursuant to which an interception has been made is later discredited.  If that
happens, the order may be set aside rendering the interception unlawful ab
initio, or the interception may be rejected in evidence under s. 24(2)  of
the Charter .  The question of preserving the formal validity of the
order purely for the purpose of showing deference for court orders does not
arise in either case.  In the first case, Part IV.1 expressly provides for the
order to be set aside.  In the second, the remedy under s. 24(2)  of
the Charter  is confined to the exclusion of evidence.  While there might
arguably be power under s. 24(1)  to set aside the improperly
obtained court order, it is difficult to see what purpose it would serve.

 

I offer a final comment under
this head. While I disagree with Sopinka J.'s view that the Wilson and Garofoli
applications can be consolidated, I do not dispute that the present structure
creates unnecessary problems. Criminal law and criminal procedure should be
simple and easily understandable.  The procedural complexity associated with
two different courts deciding essentially the same issue -- the admissibility
of evidence -- defies this precept.  The issue of an appeal from a Wilson
application presents particular difficulty.  While Martin J.A. in the court
below offers a possible temporary solution to the problem of appeal, it is for
Parliament to provide final resolution of the confusion created by application
of the current legislative regime in conjunction with the Charter .  In
this regard I reiterate the plea of McIntyre J. in R. v. Meltzer, supra,
that Parliament rectify any confusion or delay that arises from the Criminal
Code 's treatment of wiretaps.

 

III. The Scope of Review of
Authorizations

 

I turn now to the second
major concern raised on this appeal -- the manner in which courts should
approach and resolve certain issues left open by the Criminal Code ,
which arise when considering the review of authorizations to wiretap.   I refer
to the issue of when, if ever, the packet should be ordered opened; the related
issue of editing the material in the packet upon opening, and the issue of the
extent to which a judge should allow cross-examination of deponents of
affidavits in the packet.

 








Part IV.1 of the Criminal
Code  provides that the material upon which the authorization is based is
confidential but can be opened on the order of a judge.  It also provides that
interceptions unlawfully obtained are inadmissible as evidence unless the
defect is procedural only.  It says nothing about the right of a person
affected by the communication to cross-examine or present evidence on an
application to suppress evidence of an interception.  Thus a judge may be
called upon under the legislation to do two things:  (1) permit opening of the
packet; and (2) suppress evidence of an intercepted communication.  The
question is what criteria the judge should use in making his or her decision on
these matters in the face of the Code's silence.

 

Where legislation confers
powers upon courts but says nothing as to how those powers are to be exercised,
the courts have no choice but to themselves supply the missing criteria.  The
result, in the case of Part IV.1, has been a plethora of divergent judicial
opinion, reflecting a variety of judicial philosophies.  One searches, in this
sea of uncertainty, for a rock upon which to found a more objective opinion. 
That rock, in my view, must be the intention of Parliament as manifested in the
purposes of the legislation and the values which it reflects.

 

I affirmed at the beginning
of these reasons that the purpose of Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code  is
to protect the privacy of individuals from invasion by electronic monitoring,
while preserving the power of the police to intercept communications where they
have reason to believe that a crime has been or may be committed and the
interception is reasonably necessary.  As will become apparent, it is my view
that the answer to the questions of when the packet should be ordered opened,
what editing is justifiable and when cross-examination should be permitted,
depends on balancing the interests of the Crown and the public in the
administration of justice against the interests of the individual whose liberty
is at stake.

 








A.  The Application to Open and Edit
the Packet

 

Against this background, I
turn to the considerations which should govern a judge on an application to
open the packet under s. 178.14(1).

 

My colleague, Sopinka J.,
takes the view that the packet should be opened in all cases.  I share the view
that in most cases this should happen.  However, I approach the matter somewhat
differently.  As I see it, the matter is in the discretion of the judge hearing
the application.  He or she must decide whether the packet should be opened, by
asking whether the interest of the accused in opening the packet is outweighed
by the public interest in the administration of justice.

 

Analysis of the issue must
begin with the wording of s. 178.14(1):

 

178.14 (1)  All documents relating to an
application made pursuant to section 178.12 or subsection 178.13(3) or
178.23(3) are confidential and, with the exception of the authorization, shall
be placed in a packet and sealed by the judge to whom the application is made
immediately upon determination of such application, and such packet shall be
kept in the custody of the court in a place to which the public has no access
or in such other place as the judge may authorize and shall not be

 

(a) opened or the contents thereof
removed except

 

(i) for the purpose of dealing with an
application for renewal of the authorization, or

 

(ii) pursuant to an order of a judge of a
superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as defined in section 482;
and

 

(b) destroyed except
pursuant to an order of a judge referred to in subparagraph (a)(ii).

 








The wording of the section
makes it clear that there is no right to see the documents upon which an
authorization has been based.  Parliament's dominant intention was that the
documents should remain confidential; they may be disclosed only on an
application for renewal or upon the order of a judge.  The only question is
when a judge should order them disclosed.  This may be contrasted with the
situation in the United States, where the legislation requires the contents of
the packet to be delivered to the accused ten days before trial:  Omnibus
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, 18 U.S.C. {SS} {SS} 2510-20 (1988).

 

Should a judge routinely
order the contents of the packet disclosed to persons before trial?  Or should
a judge do so only where circumstances are made out which suggest that the
accused's privacy interest has been infringed in a way forbidden by Part IV.1?  
As a matter of statutory construction, the first alternative is untenable.  If
Parliament had intended all accused to have access to the packet without more,
it would have passed a provision such as that which already existed in the
United States.  On the other hand, routine denial of access to the contents of
the packet puts in doubt an accused's ability to make full answer and defence,
a right provided by s. 577(3) (now s. 650(3)) of the Criminal Code .

 

The next question is what
effect the Charter  has on the situation.  The Charter  guarantees
an accused a right to a fair trial and to make full answer and defence.  It is
argued that it is an element of a fair trial that the accused have the right to
challenge evidence which may be inadmissible.  It is said that the accused
cannot challenge an interception if he or she is not granted access to the
packet.  Therefore, the argument continues, unless access is granted the right
to a fair trial is denied.  In these circumstances, it is argued that the judge
should exercise the discretionary powers conferred by Part IV.1 of the Code
in conformity with the Charter  and grant access in all cases. 
Disclosure would be the rule.

 








The British Columbia Court of
Appeal in Dersch (1987), 17 B.C.L.R. (2d) 145, per Esson J.A. (as
he then was), took issue with the second proposition in this argument -- the
proposition that the right to a fair trial includes the right to effectively
challenge evidence obtained under Part IV.1 of the Code -- on the basis
that the grounds upon which the evidence would be excluded are
""technical"".  He stated, at p. 151:

 

It
follows, in my view, that refusal of the opportunity to demonstrate a defect in
the proceedings leading to the authorization does not affect the right to make
full answer and defence or the right to fair trial.  It merely deprives the
accused of an opportunity to have relevant evidence excluded on a technical
ground.  That opportunity is not a constitutionally protected right.

 

This raises the question of
what is meant by ""fair trial"" and ""full answer and
defence"".  Prior to the Charter , evidence which was reliable and 
relevant was routinely admitted, notwithstanding that it might have been
obtained improperly:  see R. v. Wray, [1971] S.C.R. 272.  However, at
least since the advent of the Charter , this Court has emphasized that
the right to make full answer and defence is ""a cornerstone of the justice
system"" and cannot lightly be eroded:  see Mills v. The Queen,
[1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, per Wilson J. (dissenting on other grounds), at p.
969.   The words ""full answer and defence"" entitle the accused to put
forward all defences, regardless of whether they are based on a technicality or
not.   Indeed, the adjective ""full"" permits no other conclusion.  
The right to make full answer and defence cannot be diminished to the right to
make non-technical answer and defence.  For this reason, I must reject the
reasoning of the British Columbia Court of Appeal.

 

At the same time, I do not
subscribe to the view that there is in all cases an automatic right to
disclosure of the contents of the packet.  Like other rights under the Charter ,
the right to make full answer and defence may come into conflict with other
rights and values.  It may be necessary to balance these interests against the
right to make full answer and defence.








This is illustrated by the
problem of editing.  I agree with Sopinka J. that a judge may withhold certain
portions of the packet on grounds, for example, that those portions might disclose
the identity of an undercover operative.  Denial of this information might lead
an accused to complain about being deprived of the right to make full answer
and defence.  Nevertheless, the editing must be permitted because the public's
interest in the administration of justice outweighs the accused's interest in
obtaining the identity of the informant.  I further agree with Sopinka J. that
edited material can be considered in deciding whether the authorization can be
supported.

 

On the balancing approach I
propose, the accused must make a preliminary showing that his or her interest
in privacy or a fair trial justifies opening the packet.  This will not be
difficult to do in most cases, since, as the Court of Appeal below and Sopinka
J. point out, it is in most cases virtually impossible for an accused to
challenge evidence which may turn out to have been improperly obtained unless
the accused is permitted to see the material upon which the authorization was
granted.

 

The next question is whether
there are countervailing interests which outweigh the accused's interest in
seeing the contents of the packet.  In most cases there will be few, provided
that proper editing takes place.  As a result, it can be predicted that in most
cases the accused will be granted access to the packet.

 








To summarize, it is my view
that the accused's right to make full answer and defence mandates that a judge
on an application to open the packet should give the accused access to the
packet, subject to any overriding interests in the due and proper administration
of justice.  Notwithstanding that the onus is on the accused to show that his
or her interest in production outweighs concerns relating to the administration
of justice, it may be predicted that in most cases this will result in
reasonably complete disclosure of the contents of the packet, since in most
cases the accused's interest is clear and disclosure will not unduly impede the
administration of justice.

 

B.  The Right to Cross-Examine

 

I turn next to the question
of whether the accused, having gained access to the packets, should be
permitted to cross-examine the deponents of the affidavits thus disclosed with
a view to having the wiretap evidence declared inadmissible.  Under what
circumstances is the accused entitled to an evidentiary hearing?

 

Cross-examination may be
relevant either on an application under Part IV.1 to set aside an
authorization, or on an application to reject the interception under s. 24(2)  of
the Charter  on the ground that it constitutes an unreasonable search and
seizure under s. 8  of the Charter .  Since the Code and
the Charter  are both silent on the right to cross-examination on such an
application, the matter is entirely within the discretion of the judge.

 








My colleague, Sopinka J.,
rejects the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal below, which in turn
reflected the American rule in Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978),
requiring a preliminary showing of deliberate or reckless falsehood coupled
with prima facie proof controverting the affidavits such that sufficient
grounds for the authorization may not be present.  Sopinka J. rejects
imposition of such conditions on the ground that they might deny the right to
make full answer and defence.  Although he would require that leave be granted
in the discretion of the judge and suggests that ""a basis must be shown by
the accused for the view that the cross-examination will elicit testimony
tending to discredit the existence of one of the preconditions to the
authorization, as for example the existence of reasonable and probable
grounds"", it is clear that he sees the right of cross-examination as broad
and wide-ranging.  Indeed, this is apparent in his rejection of the conclusion
of the Court of Appeal that the case for cross-examination had not been made out. 
By contrast, I see the right of cross-examination on an application under Part
IV.1 as a function of balancing the conflicting interests of the accused and
the public, a balancing which, in my view, will not infrequently result in
denial of the opportunity to cross-examine those who have sworn affidavits in
support of the authorization.

 

I would approach the problem
in the same way as I did the question of opening the packet.  The accused, in
order to justify an evidentiary hearing and the right to cross-examine, must
show that this is necessary.  In the case of an application to set aside the
authorization, he or she must show that cross-examination may assist in
establishing that the requirements for an authorization were not met in fact. 
In the case of an application to suppress evidence on the basis of a Charter 
violation, he or she must show that cross-examination may assist in
establishing that violation and hence is necessary to ensure that he or she is
able to make full answer and defence.  Against these considerations the judge
must weigh conflicting interests, including the public interest in the proper
administration of justice.

 








An evidentiary hearing and
cross-examination of deponents is potentially much more detrimental to the
administration of justice than is opening the packet.  Cross-examination is
much more likely to reveal the details of investigative operations and the
identity of informers than affidavits, which can be carefully drafted to avoid
such pitfalls.  How can one cross-examine an officer on the reliability of an
informant without probing details that might reveal that informant's identity,
for example?  Once a damaging statement is made in answer to a question in
cross-examination, editing is to no avail.  Attempts to restrict the scope of
cross-examination are notoriously fallible.  Since effective cross-examination
usually depends on considerable latitude in questioning, a restricted
cross-examination may be of little value.  Moreover, it is often difficult to
predict when a particular question will evoke a response that trenches on a
prohibited area.  Finally, cross-examination may lead to unduly lengthening
trials on collateral evidentiary matters.

 

On the other side of the
balance, the importance to the defence of cross-examination may often be less
than opening the packet.  The issue on a hearing to set aside an authorization,
or suppress evidence for a Charter  violation, is not whether the
information is true per se, but rather whether it was capable of supporting
a reasonable belief that a crime had been or was about to be committed.  Thus
the cross-examination must do more than show that some of the averments may
have been untrue or that an informer, for example, lied to the deponent -- it
must show that the averments could not have supported a reasonable belief on
the part of the deponent.  It has been observed that cross-examination is a
powerful engine for ferreting out the truth; but what is reasonable as opposed
to true may be susceptible of being determined by review of the record as much
as by cross-examination in many cases.  In these circumstances, it may be
difficult to conclude that cross-examination is essential to establishing that
the conditions for authorization were not made out and to presenting full
answer and defence.

 

In summary, cross-examination
may present greater problems for the administration of justice and less
importance from the point of view of ensuring a fair trial, than does access to
the packet.  In the result, the public interest in the administration of
justice may be expected to more often outweigh the accused's interest in
privacy and in presenting full answer and defence.

 








It is against this background
that the Franks test adopted in the court below should be viewed.  Given
the tenuous connection between cross-examination and reasonableness, and given
the potential impact on the administration of justice of permitting
cross-examination and the difficulty involved in controlling its scope, the
requirement that the accused make a substantial preliminary showing that a
false statement in the affidavit was made knowingly or recklessly does not seem
unreasonable.   The judge's task on an application for cross-examination must
be to determine whether the accused has raised a right which is not outweighed
by considerations relating to the proper administration of justice.  As a
general rule, this will require the accused to make a preliminary showing that
false statements in the affidavit in question were made knowingly or
recklessly, and that without those statements there would be insufficient
grounds for the authorization and the search and seizure which the interception
represents.  Only if this is established, can cross-examination possibly be of
value to the accused.  If the statements were in fact true, cross-examination
cannot avail.  Moreover, even if they were untrue but believed and made in good
faith and without recklessness, cross-examination cannot avail, since the reasonable
belief required for a valid search and seizure or interception under the Code
is present.  Thus, unless the accused can make a prima facie showing
that the affidavit contains false statements made knowingly or recklessly, he
or she has not raised any real possibility that the cross-examination sought
will avail him or her.  In short, he or she has failed to make out an interest
in cross-examining.  In these circumstances, the public interest in maintaining
the confidentiality of police information and avoiding unnecessary delay in the
trial process is virtually certain to outweigh the accused's interest in
cross-examination. In saying this, I do not suggest that the Franks test
should be mechanically applied in this country, nor do I discount the
possibility that a number of obvious errors might alone be sufficient to make a
preliminary showing of recklessness.

 








It is apparent from the
foregoing that I propose the same test for the Wilson application under
the Code and the Garofoli application under the Charter .  
In my view, this is appropriate, since the same considerations arise both under
the Code and under the Charter  applications.   Under both the Code
and the Charter , it is necessary to consider whether there were
reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the offence has been or is
being committed.   Similarly, the existence of alternative investigative
procedures is relevant both under the Code, by its express language, and
under the Charter  in considering whether the evidence should be excluded
under s. 24(2) .   Moreover, the ultimate issue in each case is the same  --
namely, whether the wiretap evidence should be excluded.

 

C. Application to the Case at Bar

 

I would summarize my
conclusions on the issues of opening the packet and cross-examination on the
affidavits found in it, as follows.  The fundamental considerations in both
cases are the interest of the accused in protection of privacy and a fair trial,
including the right to make full answer and defence, on the one hand, and the
public interest in the administration of justice, on the other.  The judge in
exercising his or her discretion must balance these considerations.  On
applications to open the packet, the balance will generally fall in favour of
opening the packet, subject to editing and special concerns for the
administration of justice which may arise in particular cases.  On applications
to cross-examine the deponent of affidavits, the balance will generally favour
denial unless the accused is able to make a preliminary showing establishing
the special relevance of the cross-examination.

 

Turning to the facts of this
case, the Court of Appeal held that the packet should have been ordered opened,
subject to editing.   I agree that the balance in this case between the
interests of the accused and the public interest in the administration of
justice mandates that conclusion.

 








On the question of
cross-examination, the Court of Appeal satisfied itself that no such showing
had been made and after reviewing the accused's allegations concluded that the
proposed cross-examination would have served little purpose.  As Martin J.A.
wrote at p. 131:

 

Even if it
be assumed in Garofoli's favour that he was not in Hamilton in December, 1982,
that would merely show that the informant may have been mistaken as to the date
of the alleged ""approach"".  Furthermore, even if the informant lied
as to the occurrence, that would not show that Officer Campbell had, in his
affidavit, made a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless
disregard for the truth.  Similarly, even if the informant lied as to Garofoli
being the ""unidentified person"" observed by the police on July 25,
1983, this would not show that Officer Campbell had made a false statement in
his affidavit knowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard for its
truth.

 

I see no error in this conclusion.

 

It follows that the accused
in this case has failed to establish that cross-examination was likely to
assist him in presenting a full answer and defence.  On the other hand,
cross-examination posed risks of disclosure of confidential police information
and of lengthening the proceedings to no purpose.  In these circumstances, the
balance clearly favours rejection of the right to cross-examine.

 

IV.                        Conclusion

 

I have expressed my views on
points 1 to 6 raised in this appeal, as summarized by Sopinka J.  I agree with
Sopinka J.'s conclusion on point 7 and conclude that the absence of a
minimization clause is not per se in violation of the Charter  or
Part IV.1 of the Code.  I also agree with his views on whether the
accused was shown to have absconded, and whether the trial judge properly
cautioned the jury with respect to the evidence of accomplices (points 8 and
9).








I would dismiss the appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for
british columbia

 








Criminal law --
Interception of private communications -- Access to sealed packet -- Whether
accused must show prima facie misconduct by applicant before being able to
inspect affidavit filed in support of wiretap authorization -- Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, s. 178.14
-- Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , ss. 7 , 8 .

 

Appellants were charged with
various drug trafficking offences.  The evidence against them was obtained
partly from wiretaps.  They were granted access to the sealed packets
containing the affidavits used to obtain the wiretap authorizations, but the
provincial superior court ruled that the packets should not have been released
when the appellants had not shown prima facie misconduct by the
applicants for the authorizations.  The Court of Appeal affirmed this decision.

 

Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 

Per Dickson C.J. and Lamer C.J. and La
Forest, Sopinka and Gonthier JJ.:  Prima facie misconduct is not
required to be shown by an accused who seeks access to the documents relating
to an application for a wiretap authorization.  The assertion that the
admission of the evidence is challenged and that access is required in order to
permit full answer and defence to be made is sufficient.

 








Under s. 178.14(1)(a)(ii)
of the Criminal Code , the sealed packet is to be opened only on the
order of a judge.  The fact that Parliament relies on judicial discretion does
not disclose an intention to deny the accused disclosure, but rather indicates
that the judge must carefully and thoroughly exercise his discretion taking
into account all the interests involved.  A series of pre‑Charter 
cases read in certain very restrictive criteria, but the right to make full
answer and defence requires disclosure to an accused, since without the
information contained in the packet he may not be able to establish that the
interception was unlawfully made and thus inadmissible, or unreasonably made
and thus in contravention of s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms .  The judge still has a discretion but, in the case of an
accused, it would not be judicially exercised in conformity with the Charter 
right unless the application is granted.

 

Here, the authorization is
spent, and the concern with respect to disclosure of police informers and
techniques will be addressed by the trial judge in determining the degree to
which editing is required.  If dissatisfied with the editing, the Crown always
has the option of withdrawing tender of the evidence.

 

Per L'Heureux‑Dubé and McLachlin
JJ.:  The question of whether the packet should be opened is a matter within
the discretion of the judge hearing the application, who must balance the
interests of the accused in the protection of privacy and a fair trial,
including the right to make full answer and defence, with the public interest
in the administration of justice.  Given the importance of the accused's right
to make full answer and defence, the balance will generally fall in favour of
opening the packet, subject to editing and special concerns for the
administration of justice which may arise in particular cases.  Here there is
nothing to suggest that the balance mandates any other conclusion than the
issuing judge's decision to open the packet.

The judgment of Dickson C.J.
and Lamer C.J. and La Forest, Sopinka and Gonthier JJ. was delivered by

 

SOPINKA J. -- This appeal is
one of a series of appeals which were heard together because they deal with
various aspects of the law relating to the interception of private
communications (hereinafter ""wiretaps"").  The statutory provisions
which are engaged are contained in Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  The other cases in the series are R. v. Garofoli,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, R. v. Lachance, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, and R. v.
Zito, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, judgments in which are delivered concurrently
with the judgment in this case.  The central issue in this case is the right of
access by an accused person to the packet which, pursuant to s. 178.14(1) (now
s. 187(1)), is required to be sealed.

 

Facts

 








The appellants were charged
with various offences involving drug trafficking.  They were given notice, in
accordance with the statutory requirement, that evidence against them included
wiretap evidence obtained under twenty-two authorizations under Part IV.1 of
the Criminal Code .  The appellants applied to the Vancouver County Court
for an order pursuant to s. 178.14(1) (a)(ii) to have access to the
contents of the sealed packets containing the affidavit filed in support of the
wiretap authorizations.  The application for access was in each case supported
by an affidavit stating that access to the statements by the police officers
was necessary to properly conduct a preliminary hearing and in order for the
accused to make full answer and defence.

 

Wetmore Co. Ct. J. granted
access in an oral judgment, following the cases of Wilson v. The Queen,
[1983] 2 S.C.R. 594 (presumably the minority judgment), and R. v. Finlay and
Grellette (1985), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 48 (Ont. C.A.).  The Crown applied to the Supreme
Court of British Columbia for an order of certiorari to quash the County
Court order, and prohibition to prevent Wetmore Co. Ct. J. from making available to the
accused copies of the affidavits sealed in the packets.  Murray J., in reasons
reported at (1986), 32 C.C.C. (3d) 346 (sub nom. Re Regina and Dersch),
granted the Crown's applications, holding that the issuing court acted without
jurisdiction in releasing the sealed packet when the accused provided no
evidence of a prima facie case of misconduct on the part of the
applicant for the authorization.  An appeal to the British Columbia Court of
Appeal was unanimously dismissed with reasons written by Esson J.A. which are
reported as Dersch v. Canada (Attorney General) (1987), 17 B.C.L.R. (2d)
145.  Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on December 3, 1987, [1987] 2
S.C.R. vi, on the following ground:

 

Whether the British Columbia
Court of Appeal erred in construing s. 178.14  of the Criminal Code  of
Canada as imposing a burden on an accused to show prima facie misconduct
by the applicant, before the accused may inspect the affidavit filed to obtain
an electronic search order.

 

Although the issue on which leave to
appeal was granted does not refer to the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms , counsel were permitted to raise arguments on the interpretation
of s. 178.14  in light of the Charter .

 








Access to Sealed Packet

 

Section 178.14  reads as
follows:

 

178.14 (1)  All documents relating to an
application made pursuant to section 178.12 or subsection 178.13(3) or
178.23(3) are confidential and, with the exception of the authorization, shall
be placed in a packet and sealed by the judge to whom the application is made
immediately upon determination of such application, and such packet shall be
kept in the custody of the court in a place to which the public has no access
or in such other place as the judge may authorize and shall not be

 

(a)  opened or the content thereof
removed except

 

(i)  for the purpose of dealing with an
application for renewal of the authorization, or

 

(ii)  pursuant to an order of a judge of
a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as defined in section 482;
and

 

(b)  destroyed except pursuant to
an order of a judge referred to in subparagraph (a)(ii).

 

(2)  An
order under subsection (1) may only be made after the Attorney General or the
Solicitor General by whom or on whose authority the application was made for
the authorization to which the order relates has been given an opportunity to
be heard.

 

Pursuant to s. 178.14 , the
documents relating to an application for an authorization are confidential. 
They are to be placed in a packet and sealed.  The packet is to be opened only
on the order of a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge
as defined in s. 482 (now s. 552).  This provision extends the
definition of a judge beyond that of a judge of a superior court to include a
judge of a district or county court and a judge of the Court of Quebec.  The
power granted to a judge to open the packet is not limited by any provisions in
Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code .  Parliament, therefore, intended to
confer on the judge an unlimited discretion.

 








The purpose of the
confidentiality provision of this section is apparently to ensure that the
investigation is kept secret during the currency of the authorization and to
protect informers, police techniques and procedures once the authorization is
spent.  Different considerations would apply in the exercise of the discretion
of the judge depending on whether the authorization is current or spent. 
Similarly, different factors would come into play if the applicant is an
accused person, a target of an intercepted communication, or simply an
interested citizen.  The section does not distinguish, leaving it to the
judge.  Apparently, Parliament was content to leave it to the courts to decide
what special considerations were applicable to protect the rights of accused
persons in the exercise of the power to open.  

 

What these special
considerations should be is the source of considerable disagreement among
judges in the provinces.  The series of appeals of which this is one
illustrates the extent of the disagreement.  The following is a summary of the
dispositions made with respect to this issue:

 

(1)  Dersch:  The
trial judge ordered the packet opened but was reversed by Murray J. and the
British Columbia Court of Appeal.

 

(2)  Garofoli:  The trial
judge refused to open but the Ontario Court of Appeal did.

 

(3)  Lachance:  No
application was made to open because counsel thought this was foreclosed by
binding authority.  The Ontario Court of Appeal opened the packet.

 

(4)  Zito:  The trial
judge refused to open the packet.  The Court of Appeal of Quebec directed the
opening of the packet at a new trial which it directed.

 








Pre-Charter  cases saw
in s. 178.14  a legislative intention to subordinate the rights of the accused
to the needs of law enforcement.  In addition to features of the section such
as the sealed packet and limiting the power to open to specific kinds of
judges, some cases emphasized the absence from Part IV.1 of a provision similar
to that contained in Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and
Safe Streets Act, 18 U.S.C. {SS}{SS} 2510‑20 (1988).  That Act
specifically provides that the contents of the packet are to be delivered to
the accused ten days before the commencement of trial.  In reviewing these
cases, Martin J.A., in R. v. Rowbotham (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 1,
commented, at p. 40:

 

It was determined that, since
there is a specific provision for production in the United States legislation
and there is no such provision in the Canadian legislation, Parliament intended
to deny access to the sealed packet by the accused.

 

This led to the conclusion
that exceptional circumstances were required to be shown by the applicant
before an order for opening the packet was justified.  The effect of these
cases is summarized by Watt (now Justice Watt of the Ontario Court (General
Division) in Law of Electronic Surveillance in Canada (1979), at pp.
251-52:

 

... applications for orders
pursuant to section 178.14(1)(a)(ii) to open the sealed packet and reveal its
contents to the applicant have a limited chance of success whether the purpose
therefor is to discover the period or reasons for court-ordered electronic
surveillance or to enable either an accused or the Crown to develop arguments
as to the admissibility of evidence at a forthcoming trial.  Fraud and material
non-disclosure in the supporting material have frequently been referred to as
the ""exceptional circumstances"" which justify the granting of such an
order but the difficulty in obtaining extrinsic evidence of either negates
their utility as a means of obtaining the relief sought.

 








In Wilson v. The Queen,
supra, this Court discussed the terms on which an authorization could be
set aside.  Neither the majority nor the minority reasons explicitly deal with
the question of the prerequisites for access to the sealed packet. 
Furthermore, it was a case to which the Charter  did not apply.

 

The restrictive approach to
the interpretation of these provisions, as summarized by Watt, fails to take
account of a fundamental difference between Title III in the United States and
Part IV.1.  While Title III contains specific provisions designed to protect
various interests affected, Parliament was content to leave such protection in
the hands of the judiciary.  This applies not only in relation to production of
the contents of the packet, but to minimization provisions.  In my reasons in R.
v. Thompson, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000, I pointed out that the Canadian
equivalent of s. 2518(5) of Title III is the discretion in s. 178.13(2)(d)
vested in a judge.  In Lyons v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 633, Estey J.
summed up this feature of Part IV.1, at pp. 669-70 and 695 as follows:

 

The courts, therefore, must perform
carefully and thoroughly their duty under s. 178.13(2)(d) and prescribe
terms and conditions which may be advisable in the public interest under which
these invasive devices may be installed.  This judicial function is the
essential safeguard of the public interest in the bilateral operations of Part
IV.1 which must at once be both a shield against, and an instrument for, the
invasion of privacy.  It is for the court to ensure the balancing of these interests
within the plan prescribed by Parliament.

 

                                                                         .
. . 

 

My observation is intended to
give emphasis to the importance of the judicial role in the program of privacy
regulation as prescribed by Parliament in these provisions.

 

The fact that Parliament similarly relies
on judicial discretion in s. 178.14(1)(a)(ii) does not
disclose an intention to deny the accused disclosure of the sealed packet, but
rather evinces an intention that a judge must ""carefully and
thoroughly"" exercise his or her discretion taking into account all the
interests involved.

 








The Court of Appeal in this
case followed the line of reasoning of the pre-Charter  cases.  For the
reasons outlined above, it is my view that, quite apart from the effects of the
Charter , that reasoning is suspect.  It is unnecessary to come to a
final conclusion on that subject because Part IV.1 must now be considered in
light of the Charter .  The Court of Appeal (per Esson J.A.)
recognized this, but concluded that ""the Charter  has not affected, in any
general way, the statutory and case law which restricts access to the
packet"" (p. 183).  This conclusion was based in large measure on the
interpretation placed by Esson J.A. on the judgment of Martin J.A. in Finlay
and Grellette, supra, at pp. 76-77, which, in his opinion, did not
intend to question the cases which restricted access to the sealed packet.  In
his opinion, the restrictions imposed by these cases simply meant that there
might be cases in which these restrictions deprived an accused of access to
material essential to the defence.  Such a deprivation could be relevant to the
question whether there had been a fair trial.

 

Since the decision of the
Court of Appeal in this case, we have had the benefit of the judgment of the
Court of Appeal of Ontario in Rowbotham, supra.  The court,
consisting of Martin J.A., Cory J.A. (as he then was) and Grange J.A.,
explained the effect of the Charter  on the views expressed in the
restricted access cases.  The court stated:  ""If these views were
originally correct, they are no longer the rule in this province since the
enactment of the Charter "" (at p. 41).  The court went on to explain, at p.
42:

 

To deny an
accused access to the sealed packet puts him in an impossible position. 
Without the information contained in the packet, he may not be able to
establish that the interception was unlawfully made and thus inadmissible, or
unreasonably made and thus in contravention of s. 8  of the Charter .  An accused
would, in that way, be deprived of the right to make full answer and defence. 
In such circumstances, it could not be said that he had had the benefit of a
fair trial, and the rights provided to him by ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the
Charter  would, as a consequence, be infringed.

 








In R. v. Playford
(1987), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 142, Goodman J.A., speaking for himself, Blair and Cory
JJ.A., expressed the dilemma in which the accused is placed by the restricted
access cases in these words, at p. 178:

 

... he cannot gain access to
the affidavit unless he can prove on a prima facie basis the grounds for
such access and he cannot prove such grounds unless he has access.

 

I agree that this is an
accurate statement as to the position in which the accused is placed by the
restricted access cases.  As pointed out by Watt J., extrinsic evidence is seldom
available to establish the requisite prima facie grounds.  The accused
is placed in this dilemma in virtually every case.  If placing him or her in
this dilemma is a denial of the right to make full answer and defence, then in
every case in which access is denied, the accused is denied the right to make
full answer and defence.  Consequently, there would be in every such case a
breach of s. 7  of the Charter , which includes among its principles of
fundamental justice the right to make full answer and defence.  If the
restricted access cases are right in their interpretation of the section, then
Parliament has authorized a procedure which uniformly results in a breach of
the Charter .  It follows that either the section is unconstitutional or
the interpretation of the restrictive access cases cannot stand.  With respect,
I agree with the Ontario Court of Appeal that the section is constitutional and
that the previous interpretation can no longer apply.  It is fundamental to
this view that denial of access constitutes a denial to make full answer and
defence.

 

Esson J.A. was of the opinion that it did not. 
He reasoned that the accused was simply deprived of an opportunity to exclude
evidence on a technical ground.  He put the position this way, at p. 151:

 








It
follows, in my view, that refusal of the opportunity to demonstrate a defect in
the proceedings leading to the authorization does not affect the right to make
full answer and defence or the right to fair trial.  It merely deprives the
accused of an opportunity to have relevant evidence excluded on a technical
ground.  That opportunity is not a constitutionally protected right.

 

The presumption of innocence
requires the prosecution to prove that the accused is guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt.  This must be done by admissible evidence.  Part IV.1
provides that evidence of intercepted private communication is admissible only
if lawfully obtained.  To be admissible, the evidence must be obtained pursuant
to an authorization that complies with the dictates of the provisions of Part
IV.1.  Under s. 8 of the Charter , the accused has acquired a
constitutional right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure. 
Because an unlawful search will be an unreasonable one, s. 8  also
confers on the accused the right to challenge the lawfulness of a search or
seizure of which the accused is the target.  That right would be hollow if it
did not permit access to the sealed packet.  The absence of reasonable and
probable grounds for the authorization is a basis for challenge under both the Code
and the Charter .  

 

Goodman J.A. in Playford,
supra, summed it up as follows, at p. 187:

 

If, indeed, the authorization
had been obtained on the basis of some substantive defect which made the
authorization invalid, then the private communication is unlawfully intercepted
and is inadmissible as evidence and the interception constitutes an unreasonable
search contrary to s. 8  of the Charter .

 

Withholding information which
enables the accused to assert the inadmissibility of evidence not only on
statutory but constitutional grounds strikes me as going beyond depriving the
accused of a technical ground.  I prefer to characterize it in the language of
Watt J. in R. v. Parmar (1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 260, at p. 273:








It is said that a critical
aspect of the right to make full answer and defence, an incident of the
constitutional right of fundamental justice guaranteed by s. 7  of the Charter ,
is the right to challenge the receivability of that portion of the
prosecution's proof which is the primary evidence said to have been obtained by
interceptions ...

 

The right to full answer and
defence does not imply that an accused can have, under the rubric of the Charter ,
an overhaul of the whole law of evidence such that a statement inadmissible
under, for instance, the hearsay exclusion, would be admissible if it tended to
prove his or her innocence.  (See R. v. Williams (1985), 44 C.R. (3d)
351 (Ont. C.A.).)  But it does provide, in my view, that the accused be given
the opportunity to test the admissibility of a piece of evidence according to
the ordinary rules that govern the admissibility of the evidence.  I am
therefore of the view that s. 178.14(1) (a)(ii) ought to be
interpreted so that an opportunity is provided to do so.

 

The same view of the right to
full answer and defence was taken with respect to documents relating to search
warrants.  In R. v. Hunter (1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 14, Cory J.A., in
delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, held that the material upon
which the warrant was obtained should be produced to enable the accused to make
full answer and defence.  He added that the identity of police informers could
be protected by careful editing.

 








We are dealing here with
production of material in respect of an authorization that is spent.  The
concern with respect to disclosure of police informers and techniques will be
addressed by the trial judge in determining the degree to which editing is
required.  This issue is discussed in my reasons in Garofoli, but two
observations are appropriate.  In the final analysis, the non-disclosure of
informers and techniques is fully in control of the Crown.  If dissatisfied
with the degree of editing, the Crown always has the option of withdrawing
tender of the evidence.  Furthermore, as observed by the Court of Appeal in Rowbotham,
supra, once disclosure becomes the rule, affidavits will be drawn in
such a way that the police interest will be protected with a minimum of
editing.

 

I do not agree with Esson
J.A. that the view expressed above is an amendment to the statute.  Section
178.14 , as I have pointed out above, confers on a judge a wide‑open
discretion to order the packet to be opened.  A series of cases has filled the
gap in the legislation by reading in certain criteria for the exercise of that
discretion in the case of an application for access by an accused person. 
Those criteria are very restrictive.  A series of cases since the Charter 
has questioned those restrictions in light of the Charter  guarantee of
full answer and defence.  They hold that this right requires disclosure to an
accused.  The judge still has a discretion but, in the case of an accused, it
would not be judicially exercised and in conformity with the Charter 
right unless the application is granted.  This does not affect the discretion
in respect of a request by a target or a member of the public who is not an
accused person, to which different considerations would apply.  This is not an
amendment to the section, but rather an alteration of the judicial
interpretation placed on it in light of the Charter .

 

Accordingly, the question
posed in the ground of appeal upon which leave was granted must be answered in
the affirmative.  Prima facie misconduct is not required to be shown by
the accused applicant who seeks access to the sealed packet.  The assertion, as
in this case, that the admission of the evidence is challenged and that access
is required in order to permit full answer and defence to be made is
sufficient.  

 








The application to open the
sealed packet must be made in accordance with s. 178.14(1)(a)(ii).  In some cases,
the designated judge will not be the trial judge.  It would be preferable to
have the application before the trial judge and when the trial is before a
judge referred to in s. 178.14(1)(a)(ii), the application should be to
the trial judge.  If not, the motion judge should simply make the order and
refer the matter for editing (if necessary) and further disposition to the
trial judge.  The propriety of so doing is discussed in my reasons in Garofoli. 
It is to be hoped that this additional proceeding, which adds to the cost of
litigation and serves no important purpose, will be eliminated by legislative
amendment to enable the application in all cases to be made to the trial
judge.  No problem is presented in this case as the trial judge is a judge
referred to in the section.

 

Disposition

 

The appeal is allowed and the
order of Wetmore Co. Ct. J. is restored.  Other matters consequent on the
opening of the sealed packet are not in issue here.  They will be dealt with in
Garofoli and Lachance in the context of their specific facts.

 

The reasons of L'Heureux‑Dubé and McLachlin
JJ. were delivered by

 

MCLACHLIN J. -- This is one
of a series of appeals relating to the electronic interception of private
communications; the others in the series are R. v. Garofoli, [1990] 2
S.C.R. 000; R. v. Lachance, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 000; and R. v. Zito,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 000.  I have read the reasons of Justice Sopinka in each of
these appeals, and I explained in Garofoli how my approach to the
interpretation of Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
leads me to a different conclusion with respect to a number of the questions
that these appeals present.  I now address the issue on this appeal in light of
the approach I adopt in Garofoli.

 








The issue in this case is
whether an accused is entitled to have access to the sealed packet, the
contents of which provide the basis for the granting of an authorization to
wiretap private communications.  The appellants applied pursuant to s. 178.14(1) (a)(ii)
of the Criminal Code  for an order entitling them to access.  Wetmore Co.
Ct. J. granted access, but the order was overturned by Murray J., of the
Supreme Court of British Columbia (1986), 32 C.C.C. (3d) 346, who held that the
issuing court acted without jurisdiction in providing access to the sealed packet
when the appellants had provided no evidence of a prima facie case of
misconduct on the part of the applicant for the authorization.  The British
Columbia Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed an appeal from the judgment of
Murray J. (1987), 17 B.C.L.R. (2d) 145.

 

As I explained in my reasons
in Garofoli, the question of whether or not the packet should be opened
is a matter within the discretion of the judge hearing the application.  The
fundamental considerations are the interests of the accused in the protection
of privacy and a fair trial, including the right to make full answer and
defence, on the one hand; and the public interest in the administration of
justice on the other.  The judge in exercising his or her discretion must
balance these considerations.  Given the importance of the accused's right to
make full answer and defence, the balance will generally fall in favour of
opening the packet, subject to editing and special concerns for the
administration of justice which may arise in particular cases.

 

In this case, Wetmore Co. Ct.
J. heard the application to open the packet and he granted access.  This was a
matter within his discretion, and there is nothing here to suggest that the
balance between the interests of the accused and the public interest in the
administration of justice mandates any other conclusion.  I would therefore
allow the appeal and restore the order of Wetmore Co. Ct. J.

    Defence
counsel in the course of cross‑examination posed a question which would
have led to disclosure of the identity of a police informer.  Crown counsel
objected to the question as being irrelevant and exercised her discretion to
stay the proceedings under s. 508(1)  of the Criminal Code .  The
proceedings were then re‑instituted under s. 508(2) .  The defence was
unsuccessful in its application to stay the proceedings for abuse of process at
this stage and at the commencement of the new trial.  During the course of the
new trial, defence counsel again tried to put a line of questions which would
ultimately identify the informer, arguing that it was relevant to the issue of
entrapment.  The trial judge held the disclosure of the informer's identity
unnecessary because there had been no evidence of entrapment to this point. 
After the Crown had completed its case, defence counsel advised that he would
not be calling evidence and then, at the suggestion of the trial judge, sought
and was granted an adjournment in order to have a witness located and served
with a subpoena.  The witness failed to appear at the resumption of the trial
and the appellant's request that a material witness warrant be issued pursuant
to s. 626 of the Code was denied.  Following this ruling,
and after counsel for the Crown and a co‑accused had completed their
submissions, the witness appeared in the courtroom.  The trial judge refused
the appellant's request to re‑open the case to allow the witness to
testify because his evidence would still be immaterial absent other evidence of
entrapment.  The appellant was convicted on four counts of trafficking in a
narcotic and one count of possession for the purpose of trafficking.  His
appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed.

 

    The
issues raised in this appeal are: (1) whether the stay sought at the first
trial followed by the commencement of fresh proceedings by the Crown
constituted an abuse of process; and (2) whether the appellant was precluded
from making full answer and defence to the charges.

 

    Held (Lamer
C.J. and La Forest, Sopinka and McLachlin JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and Wilson, L'Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier and Cory JJ.:  The Crown acted
properly in staying the proceedings to protect the identity of the informer and
in moving at the first reasonable opportunity to renew the proceedings.  It
could not be said that the appellant was prejudiced in any way by delay in his
trial as he was at all times in custody on another matter.  Neither the stay
nor the re‑institution of the proceedings constituted an abuse of process
or an infringement of any Charter  rights.

 

    The
trial judge made no error in refusing to permit cross‑examination that
would have revealed the identity of the police informer.  None of the
exceptions to the rule against disclosure applies to the case at bar.  The
alleged informer could not have been a material witness to any of the incidents
comprising the counts of the indictment.  There was no evidence upon which an
argument could be made that the informer acted as an agent provocateur.  Nor
was any attack made on the validity of the search warrant that might have
required a disclosure of the informer's identity.

 

    In
refusing to issue the material witness warrant requested by defence counsel,
the trial judge exercised her discretion in accordance with the appropriate
principles of law and made no error in this ruling that could justify
overturning her discretion.  She was not satisfied that the prerequisite
conditions to the issuance of the warrant had been fulfilled or that the
evidence of the witness would be material.

 

    It
was not unreasonable for the trial judge to exercise her discretion and refuse
to permit the witness to be called when he appeared in the courtroom following
the final submissions of counsel for the Crown and for the co‑accused. No
explanation was offered as to the way in which the evidence of the witness
would be relevant.  The trial judge had an obligation to ensure that the trial
proceeded in a reasonably expeditious and orderly manner.  She had to take into
account, not simply the effect of delay and inconvenience, but the possibility
of prejudice to the co‑accused.  Furthermore, the evidence adduced made
it apparent that the appellant could not have met the burden of showing on the
balance of probabilities that entrapment occurred.

 

    Per Lamer
C.J. and La Forest and McLachlin JJ. (dissenting):  The conduct of the Crown in
staying the proceedings to avoid an adverse judicial ruling and then
recommencing them constituted an abuse of process.  The use of the power to
stay, combined with re‑institution of proceedings as a means of avoiding
an unfavourable ruling, gives the Crown an advantage not available to the
accused.  The normal and proper operation of the judicial system contemplates
that judicial errors be corrected through the appeal process.  The fact that
the Crown acted in good faith is insufficient to justify an abuse of process.

 

    The
public has an interest in prosecuting crimes as well as in protecting the
identity of informers.  Both interests could have been met had the Crown
adopted the alternative of calling no further evidence and appealing the
resulting acquittal.  In the circumstances, it cannot be said that the public
interest justified or offset the affront to justice and fairness involved in
the course the Crown chose to follow.  As the case for abuse of process had
been established, it was unnecessary to consider whether a breach of s. 11 (b) of the Charter  had
occurred.

 

    The
trial judge erred in refusing to hear the witness on the issue of entrapment. 
The issue of entrapment is to be determined separately from the issue of guilt
or innocence and the only question is whether the entrapment constitutes an
abuse of process requiring that the proceedings be stayed or set aside. 
Implicit in the notion of entrapment is the concession of having committed at
least the actus reus of the offence and fairness suggests
that the accused should not be obliged to call evidence on this question until
after the principal issue of guilt or innocence has been determined.  It was
far from clear that the witness's evidence would have been irrelevant and the
appellant was entitled to call evidence relevant to entrapment after the
verdict on his guilt.

 

    The
Crown's abuse of process could not be rectified by a new trial and a stay of
proceedings should be entered.

 

    Per Sopinka
J. (dissenting):  The reasons of Cory J. concerning s. 508  of the Criminal
Code  and the cross‑examination of the police officer
were agreed with.  The trial judge properly exercised her discretion in
refusing to issue a material witness warrant.  The conclusion of McLachlin J.
with respect to the propriety of the trial judge's refusal to reopen the case
was agreed with.  Although the trial judge erred in refusing to reopen the
case, there was no need for a new trial.  The substantive verdict of guilty did
not need to be disturbed since the evidence relevant to entrapment is not
relevant to culpability.  In order to rectify the error and restore the
appellant's opportunity to make full answer and defence, it was only necessary
to vacate the formal conviction and remit the matter to the trial judge for an
evidentiary hearing on the issue of entrapment.

//Cory J.//

 

    The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and Wilson, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and Cory JJ. was
delivered by

 

    CORY J. --
Two issues are raised by the appellant.  First, it is said that the stay sought
at the first trial followed by the commencement of fresh proceedings by the
Crown constitute an abuse of process.

 

    The
second, and somewhat more difficult issue, is whether the accused Scott was
precluded from making full answer and defence to the charges of trafficking in
cocaine.  The appellant's argument is based upon three rulings of the trial
judge.  The first prohibited the accused from cross-examining a police officer
as to the identity of the informer involved in the case.  Next, the trial judge
refused to issue a material arrest warrant for a witness.  Finally, the judge
refused to re-open the trial to allow a witness to testify at a time when the
evidence appeared to have been completed and counsel for the Crown and the
co-accused had completed their final submissions.

 

Factual
Background

 

    Scott
and his half-brother Donald Mitchell were charged on several counts relating to
the possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking.  Scott was charged
alone on three counts, Mitchell individually on one count, and the two were jointly
charged on three counts.

 

    On
December 20, 1985, Ronald Wretham, a police constable working undercover,
acting on information received from an informer, initiated talks with Scott. 
Over the next five months, Scott made a number of sales of cocaine to Wretham,
sought loans from the officer in order to purchase substantial amounts of
cocaine and promised to supply the officer with a large quantity of the drug. 
During this period there were numerous meetings and conversations and various
amounts of cocaine were delivered in exchange for funds paid by Wretham.

 

    The
circumstances of the requested loans are of some significance.  On January 24,
1986, the undercover officer met with Scott at Mitchell's residence.  During
this meeting Scott suggested a ""business proposition"" to the
officer.  Scott stated that he was prepared to ""front"" fairly large
quantities of cocaine -- one or two ounces at a time -- to Wretham on credit. 
Wretham would pay him back later when he in turn had sold the cocaine.  Wretham
declined the offer, explaining that through his business he always had
short-term access to funds that could be used to purchase cocaine.  On hearing
that, Scott told the officer that he could supply him with larger quantities of
cocaine and that the unit price would be cheaper as the quantities purchased
increased.  He advised the officer that he would soon receive a kilo of
cocaine.  Wretham confirmed that he would be interested in purchasing a part,
perhaps a pound, of that amount.

 

    Discussions
as to the arrangements for purchasing a portion of the kilo of cocaine
continued.  At Scott's request, Wretham met him on February 22.  At that time
Scott told the officer that he would have to get a lesser amount of cocaine
from a different source.  He explained that he would need to pay for the drug
before he could supply it to Wretham.  He asked the officer to loan him two to
three thousand dollars for a few days.  He offered his car, a BMW, as
collateral.  He suggested that in addition to supplying one pound of ninety per
cent pure cocaine at an agreed-upon price, he would give Wretham one and a half
ounces of cocaine free as interest on the loan.  Wretham took some time to
think about the offer and eventually agreed to make the loan on terms that were
substantially similar to those suggested by Scott.  Although the loan was never
made, Scott agreed to supply Wretham with a pound of cocaine.

 

    As
time passed, Wretham concluded that Scott had the cocaine in his possession but
was stalling on his promise to deliver it.  At their last meeting, a
disagreement arose as to how the deal was to be completed.  Wretham sensed
their relationship was deteriorating.  He called in his supporting officers and
arrested Scott.  A warrant to search Scott's apartment was obtained based in
part on information supplied by the same informer who had initially told the
police that Scott was selling drugs.

 

    The
search of Scott's premises resulted in the seizure of a quantity of cocaine and
paraphernalia used in the processing and packaging of the drug.  It must be
noted that the validity of the search warrant itself has never been attacked. 
Rather, the appellant has challenged the refusal of the trial judge to permit
cross-examination that would identify the informer who had supplied the information
both as to Scott's drug-related activities and for the search warrant.

 

The
Initial Trial and the Stay of Proceedings

 

    The
procedural history of this case is important and must be set out in some
detail.  Scott elected to be tried by judge alone.  On the second day of the
trial, during the cross-examination of the investigating officer, the presiding
judge permitted defence counsel to ask the officer why a person by the name of
Winston Ross had been arrested on the same day as the appellant.  When this
question was put to the officer, Crown counsel objected strenuously on the
grounds that it was irrelevant and would inevitably lead to the identification
of the police informer.  She argued that if Ross had material information to
give to the court he could be subpoenaed and called as a witness.  In response
to the submission the trial judge stated:

 

I have
some difficulty with the relevancy of the question.  Of course,
cross-examination can be for numerous purposes, and I am not sure what the
purpose of the question is but I think counsel should go on and maybe sometime
we will know what the relevancy of the question is.

 

    Crown
counsel conscientiously attempted to draw the attention of the judge to the
decision of this Court in Bisaillon v. Keable, [1983] 2 S.C.R.
60.  She strongly urged that the import of the decision was binding and
applicable to the ruling she sought.  The trial judge made it crystal clear
that he did not wish to hear her submissions on this point.  As a consequence,
Crown counsel exercised her discretion under s. 508(1) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, to stay the proceedings.  She
explained that ""the questioning [His] Honour has permitted would be one
that would reveal whether or not a particular person was an informant"".

 

The
Recommencement of Proceedings

 

    Shortly
thereafter, pursuant to s. 508(2) of the Code, the
Crown notified the clerk of the District Court that the proceedings against the
appellant Scott were being re-instituted.  When the indictment was presented
before Locke Dist. Ct. J., defence counsel moved to have the proceedings
stayed.  The appellant argued that the decision of the Crown to stay and then
to recommence proceedings amounted to an abuse of process.  It was said that
the Crown's motive for invoking s. 508(1) and s. (2) was ""oblique""
because Crown counsel was simply using the power granted by the section to
circumvent an evidentiary ruling with which she disagreed.

 

    Locke
Dist. Ct. J. refused the appellant's application to stay the proceedings.  He
found that the question which provoked the Crown counsel's objection ""was
clearly capable of eliciting an answer disclosing the identity of any police
informant who may have existed"" and that ""the identity of an
informant, in this case, would be an unnecessary ingredient to establish the
innocence of the accused"", particularly since the case involved the
alleged sale of narcotics to an undercover police officer.  He pointed out that
despite being given the opportunity to do so, defence counsel failed to
establish an evidentiary basis during the cross-examination of the police
officer to show any relevance for ascertaining the identity of the informer. 
Further, he indicated that the Crown's objection had not been given the
consideration it merited.

 

    Relying
on a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Hunter (1987),
34 C.C.C. (3d) 14, Locke Dist. Ct. J. expressed the opinion that the trial judge
should have taken greater care to determine whether the identification of the
informer was necessary.  He found, as well, that there was nothing oblique or
improper in Crown counsel's invocation of s. 508 of the Code to
protect the identity of the informer.  He therefore dismissed the application.

 

The New
Trial

 

    At
the commencement of the new trial, defence counsel renewed the motion for a
stay of proceedings and requested, in the alternative, that the matter be sent
back to the original trial judge.  German Dist. Ct. J., presiding at the new
trial, dismissed both applications.  In doing so, she expressly agreed with the
ruling made by Locke Dist. Ct. J.

 

    Later
in the proceedings, defence counsel attempted to undertake the same line of
questioning as to the identity of the informer that had caused the Crown to
stay the proceedings at the first trial.  Once again the Crown objected. 
Defence counsel argued that the identity of the informer was relevant to the
defence of entrapment he intended to raise on Scott's behalf.

 

    The
trial judge rejected the argument. She held that the disclosure of the name of
the police informer was unnecessary because up to this point there was no
evidence of entrapment.  Certainly no such evidence had been elicited in the
cross-examination of the police officer.  However, she advised that she was
quite prepared to allow the defence to call Winston Ross as a witness or to
adduce any other evidence that might lay the foundation for the defence of
entrapment.  Indeed, she repeated her position on this issue later during the
proceedings.

 

    When
the Crown had completed its case, counsel for Scott initially indicated that he
was not going to call any evidence.  The trial judge gave him time to
reconsider his decision.  When the trial resumed, Scott's counsel indicated
that he wished to have Winston Ross take the stand.  He requested an
adjournment for one month so that Ross could be located and served with a
subpoena.  In spite of objections from Scott's co-accused, the adjournment was
granted.

 

    One
month later, when the trial resumed, Ross was absent.  The appellant requested
that a material witness warrant be issued for Ross pursuant to the provisions
of s. 626  of the Criminal Code .  The trial judge
denied the request.  She put forward two grounds for her decision.  First, she
was not satisfied that the affidavit of service was adequate.  Further, she
expressed the view that there had still been no basis put forward by the
defence to indicate that Scott had been entrapped.  She found therefore that any
potential evidence Ross could give would be immaterial.

 

    Following
this ruling, counsel began their final arguments.  When counsel for the Crown
and the co-accused Mitchell had completed their submissions, the witness Ross
appeared in the courtroom.  But the trial judge refused to re-open the case to
allow Ross to testify.  She expressed the view once again that any evidence
Ross might tender remained immaterial since there was still no other evidence
of entrapment.  At the conclusion of all submissions, Scott was convicted on
four counts of trafficking in a narcotic and one count of possession of a
narcotic for the purpose of trafficking.

 

The
Court of Appeal

 

    Scott's
appeal was heard at the same time as R. v. Fortin (1989),
33 O.A.C. 123.  The reasoning for the court's dismissal of the appeal is, in
part, contained in the Fortin decision.  The balance of the reasons
is set out in the endorsement disposing of the case at bar.  On the first issue
of abuse of process, the court rejected the argument that s. 508  of the Criminal
Code  contravened s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  and was, as a result, unconstitutional.  The court
expressed the view that the impugned section ""is an adequate expression of
the power which has always rested in the Attorney General and which is
essential to the proper enforcement of criminal law"".  Moreover, it noted
that safeguards for the protection of the individual against the improper use
of this power had existed before the Charter  and
they were still valid.  It was the view of the court that these rights had been
enhanced by the passage of the Charter .

 

    The
court held that a Crown counsel possessed the power to direct a stay of
proceedings since the statute conferred that power upon the ""Attorney
General or counsel instructed by him"".  It stated that s. 508  must be read
together with the definition of ""Attorney General"" set out in s. 2  of
the Criminal Code  and considered in light of other sections of the Code that
confer power on the Attorney General.  Finally, the Court of Appeal in its
endorsement stated that Crown counsel by staying the proceedings was not simply
circumventing an unfavourable ruling, but was protecting an important public
interest.  It observed that while the use of the stay must always be subject to
judicial review, ""having regard to the public interests with which the
Crown was concerned, there was compelling reason to stay the proceedings"".

 

    When
it dealt with the claim of entrapment presented in Fortin, supra, the
Court of Appeal entered a stay on the grounds that Fortin was induced to
traffic in a situation where the police could at most only have reasonably
suspected that he was a user.  It followed in the view of the Court of Appeal
that according to the principles set out in R. v. Mack, [1988]
2 S.C.R. 903, the police went beyond providing Fortin with an opportunity to
commit the offence.  Rather, the police involved Fortin in procuring the
commission of the very offence with which he was charged.  As for Scott, the
Court of Appeal simply noted that there was no basis on the facts for arguing
that the trial judge had erred in refusing to stay proceedings on the grounds
of entrapment.

 

Analysis

 

Stay and
Recommencement of Proceedings

 

    In
staying the first trial, Crown counsel acted pursuant to the provisions of s.
508  (now s. 579) of the Code.  That section reads as follows:

 

    508. (1)  The Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for that purpose may, at any time after any proceedings in
relation to an accused or a defendant are commenced and before judgment, direct
the clerk or other proper officer of the court to make an entry on the record
that the proceedings are stayed by his direction, and such entry shall be made
forthwith thereafter, whereupon the proceedings shall be stayed accordingly and
any recognizance relating to the proceedings is vacated.

 

    (2)
Proceedings stayed in accordance with subsection (1) may be recommenced,
without laying a new information or preferring a new indictment, as the case
may be, by the Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for that purpose
giving notice of the recommencement to the clerk of the court in which the stay
of proceedings was entered, but where no such notice is given within one year
after the entry of the stay of proceedings, or before the expiration of the
time within which the proceedings could have been commenced, whichever is the
earlier, the proceedings shall be deemed never to have been commenced.

 

    The
validity of the provision itself is not at issue.  Rather, the appellant
challenges the manner in which the section was used by Crown counsel. It is the
appellant's submission that the staying and recommencement of proceedings was
undertaken solely to circumvent an unfavourable ruling made by the trial
judge.  To act in this way, it is argued, constitutes an abuse of process.

 

    At
the outset, it must be noted that Crown counsel was at all times acting in good
faith.  The Crown was obliged to protect the identity of the informer: see R. v.
Hunter, supra.  Crown counsel attempted to fulfil
that obligation.  Yet the judge presiding at the first trial made it very clear
by his rulings and statements that he would not listen to the Crown's
submission.    In my view, Crown counsel acted properly in staying the action
to protect the identity of an informer.  In the circumstances, the Crown was
not bound to follow the lengthy and somewhat circuitous route of offering no
further evidence and appealing the inevitable acquittal.  On the facts of this
case, it was appropriate for the Crown to move for a stay in accordance with
the statutory authority granted by s. 508  (now s. 579) of the Code. 
Subsequent to the stay of proceedings the Crown moved at the first reasonable
opportunity to renew them.  Once again the Crown acted properly.  In the
circumstances of this case, it could not possibly be said that the appellant
was prejudiced in any way by delay in his trial as he was at all times in
custody on another matter.

 

    The
actions of the Crown were not abusive.   They were aimed solely at protecting
the identity of the police informer, a value which has long been recognized as
important to society.  The principles which should guide a court in considering
a stay of proceedings have been set out in R. v. Keyowski, [1988]
1 S.C.R. 657.  There Wilson J., giving the reasons for the Court, stated at pp.
658-59:

 

    The
availability of a stay of proceedings to remedy an abuse of process was
confirmed by this Court in R. v. Jewitt, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
128.  On that occasion the Court stated that the test for abuse of process was
that initially formulated by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.
Young (1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 289.  A stay should be granted
where ""compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those
fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair
play and decency"", or where the proceedings are ""oppressive or
vexatious"" ([1985] 2 S.C.R. at pp. 136-37).  The Court in Jewitt also
adopted ""the caveat added by the Court in Young that
this is a power which can be exercised only in the `clearest of cases'""
(p. 137).

 

    This
same principle was set forth by L'Heureux-Dubé J., writing for the majority, in R. v.
Conway, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659.  At page 1667 she wrote:

 

The
doctrine is one of the safeguards designed to ensure ""that the repression
of crime through the conviction of the guilty is done in a way which reflects
our fundamental values as a society"" (Rothman v. The Queen, [1981]
1 S.C.R. 640, at p. 689, per Lamer J.).  It acknowledges that courts must have the
respect and support of the community in order that the administration of
criminal justice may properly fulfil its function.  Consequently, where the
affront to fair play and decency is disproportionate to the societal interest
in the effective prosecution of criminal cases, then the administration of
justice is best served by staying the proceedings.

 

    Neither
the stay nor the reinstitution of the proceedings can be said to constitute
either an abuse of process or an infringement of any Charter 
rights.  Locke Dist. Ct. J. and German Dist. Ct. J. were correct in their
decision to refuse to grant Scott's application to stay the new trial.  In my
view this is not one of those rare but ""clearest of cases"" in which a
stay of proceedings should be granted.

 

Was the
Accused Given the Opportunity to Make Full Answer and Defence?

 

    In
order to resolve this issue, it is necessary to review three of the rulings
made by German Dist. Ct. J. at various stages of the trial.  I will consider
each ruling in turn to determine if an error was made that prevented the
appellant from making full answer and defence.  Each ruling requires a
consideration of the evidence and the references will of necessity be somewhat
repetitive.

 

(i)The
Cross-Examination of the Police Officer as to the Identity of the Informer

 

    The
appellant argues that he had the right to ask whether Ross was the police
informer involved in this case.  It is said that this forms part of the right
of the accused to make full answer and defence.  Yet the interest of an accused
in ascertaining an answer to such a question must be balanced against the need
to protect the identity of police informers.

 

    The
value of informers to police investigations has long been recognized.  As long
as crimes have been committed, certainly as long as they have been prosecuted,
informers have played an important role in their investigation.  It may well be
true that some informers act for compensation or for self-serving purposes. 
Whatever their motives, the position of informers is always precarious and
their role is fraught with danger.

 

    The
role of informers in drug-related cases is particularly important and
dangerous.  Informers often provide the only means for the police to gain some
knowledge of the workings of drug trafficking operations and networks.  It has
been estimated that in the United States some ninety-five per cent of all
federal narcotics cases involve the work of informers:  see Williams, ""The
Defense of Entrapment and Related Problems in Criminal Prosecution""
(1959), 28 Fordham L. Rev. 399, at p. 403,
and also M. S. Bewers, ""Comments -- Defendant's Right to a Confidential
Informant's Identity"" (1979), 40 La. L. Rev. 146, at
p. 148, note 4.  The investigation often will be based upon a relationship of
trust between the police officer and the informer, something that may take a
long time to establish.  The safety, indeed the lives, not only of the
informers but also of the undercover police officers will depend on that
relationship of trust.

 

    Trafficking
in narcotics is a lucrative enterprise.  The retribution wreaked on informers
and undercover officers who attempt to gather evidence is often obscenely
cruel.  Little assistance can be expected from informers if their identity is
not protected.  There can be no relationship of trust established by the police
with informers without that protection.  If the investigation of drug-related
crime is to continue then, to the extent it is possible, the identity of
informers must be protected.

 

    The
need to protect the identity of an informer has long been recognized by the
courts of Canada and other jurisdictions.  The Ontario Court of Appeal set out
some of the reasons for maintaining this protection in Hunter, supra, at p.
18:

 

    The
rule against the non-disclosure of information which might identify an informer
is one of long standing.  It developed from an acceptance of the role of
informers in the solution of crimes and the apprehension of criminals.  It was
recognized that citizens have a duty to divulge to the police any information
that they may have pertaining to the commission of a crime.  It was also
obvious to the courts from very early times that the identity of an informer
would have to be concealed both for his or her own protection, and to encourage
others to divulge to the authorities any information pertaining to crimes.  It
was in order to achieve these goals that the rule was developed.

 

    The
same principle was recognized by this Court in Bisaillon v. Keable, supra.  There
Beetz J. stated at p. 93:

 

    It follows from these reasons that at common law the
secrecy rule regarding police informers' identity has chiefly taken the form of
rules of evidence based on the public interest, which prohibit judicial
disclosure of police informers' identity by peace officers who have learned the
informers' identity in the course of their duties.  A witness also may not be
compelled to state whether he is himself a police informer.  The rule was
developed in criminal proceedings, apparently in trials for high treason, but
it also applies in civil matters, and in both cases it has been established for
reasons which relate to the essential effectiveness of the criminal law. . . .
Its application does not depend on the judge's discretion, as it is a legal
rule of public order by which the judge is bound.

 

    It
should also be mentioned that its application is not subject to any formal
requirement and, if no one raises it, the Court must apply it of its own
motion.

 

See also
the reasons of Sopinka J., writing for the majority, in R. v.
Garofoli, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421.

 

    This
rule is also recognized in other jurisdictions: see, e.g. Wigmore on
Evidence, McNaughton Rev., vol. 8, at pp. 761-62. 

 

    The
principle is thus well accepted.  Yet the rule cannot be absolute.  In our
system the right of an individual accused to establish his or her innocence by
raising a reasonable doubt as to guilt has always remained paramount.  Beetz J.
in Bisaillon, supra, acknowledged that there was an
exception to the rule protecting informers' identity.  He wrote at p. 93:

 

The rule
is subject to only one exception, imposed by the need to demonstrate the
innocence of an accused person.  There are no exceptions in proceedings other
than criminal.

 

    Certainly,
if the informer is a material witness to the crime then his or her identity
must be revealed.  In Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53
(1957), the United States Supreme Court held that the informer's identity would
be divulged if the informer was a material witness.  Canadian courts have very
properly followed the same path in circumstances where the informer is the only
material witness to the crime: see R. v. Davies (1982), 1 C.C.C.
(3d) 299 (Ont. C.A.).

 

    An
exception should also be made where the informer has acted as agent
provocateur.  For example, in R. v. Davies, supra, the
informer not only introduced the police to the accused, but also played an
instrumental role in the trafficking scheme itself.  In those circumstances,
his identity had to be revealed.  This exception could be properly extended to
cases where the accused intends to rely upon the defence of entrapment. 
However, in order to rely on this exception, the accused will, as a general
rule, be required to establish some evidentiary basis for the defence.

 

    A
third exception may exist where the accused seeks to establish that the search
was not undertaken on reasonable grounds and therefore contravened the
provisions of s. 8  of the Charter .  Even under these conditions, a
court should strive to provide as much evidence as possible to the defence by
means of editing the information on which the search warrant was based without
disclosing the identity of the informer.  That disclosure should only be made
in circumstances where it is absolutely essential:  see R. v.
Hunter, supra.

 

    None
of these exceptions apply to the case at bar.  First, the alleged informer
could not have been a material witness to any of the incidents comprising the
counts of the indictment.  Indeed, no submissions were made that he was.

 

    Second,
on the facts of this case there was no evidence upon which an argument could be
made that the informer acted as an agent provocateur.  While
one can readily conceive of situations where the line between the informer
passing on information as to the activities of the accused and the informer
actively inducing the accused to commit a crime could be blurred, this is not
such a situation.  Here the case against the accused was almost exclusively
based on the evidence gathered by an undercover police officer over a period of
five months.  This uncontradicted evidence indicated that it was Scott who
initiated the various drug-related transactions.  It was Scott who was the
leader in all the transactions.  It was Scott who made the first offer to
provide larger quantities of cocaine and deliver them to the police officer. 
It was Scott who asked the officer for a loan and offered to put up his car as
security in order to obtain the funds to purchase larger quantities of cocaine.

 

    It
will be remembered that while German Dist. Ct. J. did not allow questions that
would have identified the informer, she did permit the appellant to
cross-examine the police officer on the issue as to whether Ross was present
during any of the transactions at issue and whether he played any role that
would engage an entrapment defence.  She advised the defence counsel of her
position in this way:

 

Now, I
think that the Crown is correct.  You may ask questions designed to go towards
a defence of entrapment.  But you may not ask or I will not permit the officer
to answer questions that will go to identify the informant.  So if you can ask
the questions that don't go to his, show his identity, then that's fine.

 

    The
cross-examination of the police officer failed to provide any indication that
Scott had been entrapped.  From this ruling and other pronouncements made by
the judge during the course of the trial, it is clear that if any basis for an
entrapment defence had been revealed, the trial judge would have reconsidered
her position regarding the protection of the informer's identity.  It is
significant that counsel for Scott did not ask those questions.  There was
simply no evidentiary basis established that would enable Scott to argue that
he was entrapped and that permitted Scott's counsel to ask whether Ross was the
police informer involved in the case.

 

    Finally,
it is clear that the third exception did not apply.  Defence counsel made no
attack upon the validity of the search warrant that might have required a
disclosure of the informer's identity.

 

    The
trial judge very properly took a flexible approach to the possible need to
reveal the identity of the informer.  In light of the position taken by the
appellant throughout the trial and the manner in which the case proceeded, the
appellant cannot contend that any error was made by the trial judge in
refusing, in the circumstances of the case, to permit cross-examination that
would have revealed the identity of the police informer.  In my view, the trial
judge made no error in her ruling on this issue.

 

(ii)  The
Trial Judge's Refusal to Issue the Material Witness Warrant

 

    When
the trial resumed, after the thirty-day adjournment, Ross did not appear. 
Counsel for Scott moved to obtain a warrant pursuant to the provisions of s.
626(2) (now s. 698) of the Criminal Code .  That section
provides as follows:

 

    626. (1)  Where a person is likely to give
material evidence in a proceeding to which this Act applies, a subpoena may be
issued in accordance with this Part requiring that person to attend to give
evidence.

 

    (2)  Where it is made to appear that a person who is
likely to give material evidence

 

(a) will not attend in response to a subpoena if a
subpoena is issued, or

 

(b) is evading service of a subpoena,

 

a court, justice or provincial court judge having power
to issue a subpoena to require the attendance of that person to give evidence
may issue a warrant in Form 12 to cause that person to be arrested and to be
brought to give evidence.

 

    (3)
Except where paragraph (2)(a) applies, a warrant in Form 12 shall not be issued
unless a subpoena has first been issued.

 

    Before
issuing a warrant, a trial judge must be satisfied on two points: first, that
proper attempts to serve the potential witness with the subpoena have been
undertaken and second, that the proposed witness is a material witness.  These
requirements are apparent from the wording of s. 626  itself and the related
provisions of the Code.  Subsections 626(1) and (3) provide
expressly that before a warrant can be issued, a subpoena must be issued and
served in the usual manner.  Second, and more importantly, both ss. 626(1) and
(2) state that the proposed witness must be someone who is ""likely to give
material evidence"".  It is a pre-condition of the issuance of the warrant
that the trial judge be satisfied of the materiality of the evidence the witness
may give.

 

    German
Dist. Ct. J. was not satisfied that either of the prerequisite conditions had
been fulfilled.  She found that the information contained in the affidavit of
service in the subpoena was inadequate and that the issuance of the subpoena
had not been completed in accordance with the standards set out in the Code.  This
is a decision that falls within the discretion of the trial judge and in my
view her findings on this point would be sufficient to justify her refusal to
issue the warrant.

 

    However,
there was another ground upon which she based her decision, namely that she was
not satisfied that the evidence of Ross could be material.

 

    The
materiality of the evidence to be given by the proposed witness is a
fundamentally important pre-condition of the issuance of the warrant.  This is
a matter that must be determined solely by the trial judge.  In R. v.
Kinzie (1956), 25 C.R. 6, the Ontario Court of Appeal held
that the power to issue a warrant was within the discretion of the trial
judge.  The court held that the issuance of the warrant is not a matter of
right but must be justified by demonstrating to the trial judge that the
witness is likely to give material evidence.  The decision of the Court of
Appeal was based in turn on the principle set out by this Court in Darville
v. The Queen (1956), 25 C.R. 1.  In that case an adjournment to
subpoena further witnesses was refused by the trial judge and his decision was
upheld on appeal because the materiality of the evidence had not been
demonstrated.  The reasons of this Court confirmed that the trial judge's
discretion could be reviewed only if it had not been exercised in a judicial
manner.

 

    In
the case under consideration, counsel for Scott had not demonstrated during the
course of the trial or upon the application for the bench warrant that the
evidence of Ross would be material.  There is no evidence that Ross was ever in
a position to overhear any of the conversations between Scott and the police or
that he was in any way involved in the drug transactions.  Neither is there any
evidence that he acted as an agent provocateur or encouraged,
importuned, or influenced Scott or the police to enter into the drug
transactions.

 

    Nor
can I accept the argument that the granting of the adjournment in order that
Ross be subpoenaed could be taken as a recognition by the trial judge that Ross
was likely to give material evidence so that a warrant should be issued. 
Although the materiality of the evidence is a pre-condition to both the issuing
of a subpoena to a witness under s. 626(1) and the issuance of a warrant under
s. 626(2), this does not mean that the same level of demonstrated materiality
is sufficient to satisfy both subsections.

 

    The
material arrest warrant provision is clearly an exceptional remedy.  The
consequences of the issuance of a warrant are far more serious for the witness
than is the service of a subpoena.  The very liberty of the subject is
involved.  It is one thing to attend court in answer to a subpoena.  The
subpoenaed witness may feel compelled to attend but attends by an act of his or
her own will.  It is quite another to be picked up by the police and escorted
to the courtroom.  The issuance of the warrant should therefore be subject to
careful consideration when an application is made to the trial judge for its
issuance.  It is appropriate and indeed essential that the trial judge
undertake a new inquiry into the materiality of the potential evidence to
determine whether or not the warrant should be issued.

 

    In
this case, the trial judge considered the pre-conditions for the issuance of
the warrant and found they were lacking.  She exercised her discretion in
accordance with the appropriate principles of law.  The exercise of that
discretion should not be lightly overturned by an appellate court.  In my view,
no error was made by the trial judge in this ruling that could justify
overturning her discretion.

 

(iii)The
Trial Judge's Refusal to Hear the Evidence of Ross When He Appeared

 

    It
will be recalled that Ross appeared in court after counsel for the Crown and
Mitchell had completed their final submissions.  The trial judge refused to
permit Ross to be called as a witness at this stage.  Once again, this is a
matter that came within the trial judge's discretion.  Although another trial
judge might have come to another decision, I cannot find that an error was
committed in this case.

 

    The
most important consideration in any criminal trial is that it be conducted
fairly in accordance with the law.  Scott received a fair trial.  It may well
be that despite the potentially unfair and inconvenient disruption, it would
have been preferable had the trial judge permitted Ross to testify.  Yet the
trial process cannot be allowed to become a mine field that presents a host of
uncharted, potentially explosive traps to even the most skilled and patient of
trial judges.  Good luck should not be the sole criterion for the successful
conclusion of a criminal trial.

 

    Let
us review once again the situation that presented itself to the trial judge
when Ross appeared.  At the conclusion of the Crown's case, Scott's counsel had
indicated that no evidence would be called on his behalf.  At no time during
the cross-examination of the police officer nor at any time during the trial
had any evidence been called that would establish the materiality of the
evidence of Ross.  Rather, the evidence portrayed an eager drug dealer anxious
to make a sale.  There was no indication that Scott was influenced, instigated,
provoked or encouraged by Ross to make the sales or was influenced in any way
by him.  Nor was there any evidence that Ross influenced the actions of the
police in any way.

 

    Any
evidence of Ross's involvement could have come from either the police or
Scott.  The police evidence certainly did not indicate that Ross was
instrumental in instigating, entrapping or provoking Scott to commit the
crimes.  Scott had chosen not to testify.  Before granting permission for Ross
to testify at this late stage, it was only reasonable that the defence explain
in what way the evidence of the witness would be relevant.  No such explanation
was offered.  The trial judge had an obligation to ensure that the trial
proceeded in a reasonably expeditious and orderly manner.  She had to take into
account, not simply the effect of delay and inconvenience, but the possibility
of prejudice to the co-accused who had objected to the granting of the
adjournment.  She was given no real basis for permitting Ross to testify after
all the evidence and most of the final submissions had been completed.  

    In
these circumstances it was not unreasonable for the trial judge to exercise her
discretion and refuse to permit Ross to be called as a witness at this late
stage of the proceedings.  As a reasonable exercise of discretion, it should
not be overturned.  Indeed, counsel for the appellant did not take issue with
the decision of the trial judge not to re-open the case, either in his factum
or in oral argument.  Rather, he acknowledged that it was a discretionary
decision and frankly conceded that he could not demonstrate any error in law
which would warrant challenging that decision.  That is a sufficient basis to
dispose of this issue.  Nonetheless, something should be said of the effect
this Court's decision in R. v. Mack, supra, could
have on this case.

 

Relevance
of the Decision in R. v. Mack

 

    The
second trial took place before the decision was rendered by this Court in R. v. Mack, supra.  Prior
to that decision, the procedure to be followed where the defence of entrapment
was raised was unclear: see, e.g. the helpful discussion of the situation by D.
Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1987), at pp. 480-91.  A
question existed whether the defence of entrapment was a substantial one to be
decided by the jury or a policy-oriented defence based on the inherent power of
courts to stay proceedings for abuse of process.  This question was not
resolved by the decision of this Court in Amato v. The Queen, [1982]
2 S.C.R. 418.  The minority judgment of Estey J., however, laid the foundation
for the separation of the issue of entrapment from the substantive elements of
the offence.  This was the position adopted unanimously by this Court in Mack, supra, where
it was held that the defence of entrapment was to be separated from the general
defence.  It was to be invoked and determined by the trial judge alone after a
finding of guilt had been made on all the requisite elements of the offence by
the trier of the fact.  Lamer J., speaking for the Court, stated at p. 972:

 

    Finally,
I am of the view that before a judge considers whether a stay of proceedings
lies because of entrapment, it must be absolutely clear that the Crown had
discharged its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had
committed all the essential elements of the offence.  If this is not clear and
there is a jury, the guilt or innocence of the accused must be determined apart
from evidence which is relevant only to the issue of entrapment.  This protects
the right of an accused to an acquittal where the circumstances so warrant.  If
the jury decides the accused has committed all of the elements of the crime, it
is then open to the judge to stay the proceedings because of entrapment by refusing
to register a conviction.  It is not necessary nor advisable in this case to
expand on the details of procedure.  Because the guilt or innocence of the
accused is not in issue at the time an entrapment claim is to be
decided, the right of an accused to the benefit of a jury trial in s. 11 (f) of the Charter  is in
no way infringed.

 

    With
the issue of entrapment separated from the rest of the defence, it is incumbent
on the accused to establish on the balance of probabilities that entrapment
occurred.  I believe the evidence adduced in this case makes it apparent that
the accused could not have met the burden of showing entrapment.  Scott, on the
evidence, was an eager drug dealer anxious to sell cocaine in substantial
quantities.  It is difficult to imagine that the evidence of Ross alone could
demonstrate that there had been any entrapment of Scott.  Even if his testimony
were favourable, it would have to contradict the evidence of the police and it
would be unsupported by any evidence from Scott.  In those circumstances, even
if there had been a wrongful exercise of discretion, I could not see any value
in directing the trial judge to hear Ross on the issue of entrapment.

 

Conclusion

 

    When
each ruling of the trial judge is examined, in order and in context, it becomes
apparent that in each instance she exercised her discretion in accordance with
the correct principles of law.  As a result, I can find no basis for
overturning her decisions.

 

    I
would dismiss the appeal.

 

    The
reasons of Lamer C.J. and La Forest and McLachlin JJ. were delivered by

 

//McLachlin
J.//

 

    MCLACHLIN J.
(dissenting) -- I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of Justice
Cory.  I agree with him on all issues save two.   First, I am of the view that
it was not open to the Crown to recommence proceedings against the accused
after entering the stay of proceedings.   Second, I would find that the second
trial judge erred in refusing to hear the witness Ross on the issue of
entrapment.

 

Recommencement
of Proceedings After Entering a Stay

 

    The
first trial judge made a ruling that the defence could ask a police officer in
cross-examination why Winston Ross had been arrested on the same day as the
appellant.   Crown counsel had objected strenuously to the question on the
ground that it might reveal the identity of a police informer.  Faced with the
ruling, Crown counsel advised the court that the Crown was entering a stay
under s. 508(1)  of the Criminal Code .   Shortly
thereafter, the Crown notified the clerk of the court that it was
re-instituting the proceedings against the accused.  The appellant moved to
have the second proceeding stayed.  His motion was rejected.  The trial
proceeded before a new judge, German Dist. Ct. J.   German Dist. Ct. J. refused
to allow questioning as to the identity of the informer -- the line of
questioning which the first judge would have permitted -- on the ground that no
evidentiary basis for a defence of entrapment had been made out.  In the end
she convicted the accused.

 

    The
accused contends that the conduct of the Crown in staying the charges before
the first judge because it did not like his ruling in favour of the defence,
and reinstating them in hopes of a more favourable ruling from a different
judge, constitutes an abuse of process and an infringement of the accused's
rights under ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  The
Crown takes the position that there was no abuse of process or Charter 
infringement because its conduct was justified in the public interest and did
not unduly prejudice the accused.

 

    It
is useful at the outset to state what is not at issue.  In particular,
the constitutionality of s. 508(1)  of the Criminal Code  is not
raised. It is not suggested that the Crown does not have the power to enter
stays, nor that this might not be appropriate in many situations.  The only
question is whether the Crown's conduct in entering a stay and then
recommencing the proceedings for the purpose of avoiding an unfavourable
evidentiary ruling constitutes an abuse of process or violates the Charter , with
the result that the convictions should be set aside.   The issue, as I see it,
is whether, once an accused has been put in jeopardy by entering a plea to a
charge, the Crown may stay that proceeding and institute a new proceeding in
order to overcome an unfavourable ruling by the trial judge.

 

The Law
with Respect to Abuse of Process

 

    This
Court has recognized the doctrine of abuse of process, quite independently of
the Charter .   A judge has the power to stay or strike down
proceedings which are oppressive or vexatious and violate the fundamental
principles of justice underlying the community's sense of fair play and
decency.  The power is to be exercised only in the ""clearest of
cases"".    As stated in R. v. Conway, [1989] 1 S.C.R.
1659, at p. 1667:

 

    A trial judge has discretion to stay proceedings in
order to remedy an abuse of the court's process.   This Court affirmed the
discretion ""where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those
fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair
play and decency and to prevent the abuse of a court's process through
oppressive or vexatious proceedings"" (R. v. Jewitt, [1985]
2 S.C.R. 128, at pp. 136-37, borrowing from R. v. Young (1984),
40 C.R. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.)).   The judge's power may be exercised only in the
""clearest of cases"" (Jewitt, supra, at p.
137).

 

    Under
the doctrine of abuse of process, the unfair or oppressive treatment of an
appellant disentitles the Crown to carry on with the prosecution of the
charge.  The prosecution is set aside, not on the merits (see Jewitt, supra, at p.
148), but because it is tainted to such a degree that to allow it to proceed
would tarnish the integrity of the court.   The doctrine is one of the
safeguards designed to ensure ""that the repression of crime through the
conviction of the guilty is done in a way which reflects our fundamental values
as a society"" (Rothman v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R.
640, at p. 689, per Lamer J.)   It acknowledges that courts must have the
respect and support of the community in order that the administration of
criminal justice may properly fulfil its function.  Consequently, where the
affront to fair play and decency is disproportionate to the societal interest
in the effective prosecution of criminal cases, then the administration of
justice is best served by staying the proceedings.

 

    In
summary, abuse of process may be established where: (1) the proceedings are
oppressive or vexatious; and, (2) violate the fundamental principles of justice
underlying the community's sense of fair play and decency.  The concepts of
oppressiveness and vexatiousness underline the interest of the accused in a
fair trial.  But the doctrine evokes as well the public interest in a fair and
just trial process and the proper administration of justice.  I add that I
would read these criteria cumulatively.   While Wilson J. in R. v.
Keyowski, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 657, at pp. 658-59, used the
conjunction ""or"" in relation to the two conditions, both concepts
seem to me to be integral to the jurisprudence surrounding the remedy of a stay
of proceedings and the considerations discussed in R. v. Jewitt, [1985]
2 S.C.R. 128, and R. v. Conway, supra.   It
is not every example of unfairness or vexatiousness in a trial which gives rise
to concerns of abuse of process.  Abuse of process connotes unfairness and
vexatiousness of such a degree that it contravenes our fundamental notions of
justice and thus undermines the integrity of the judicial process.   To borrow
the language of Conway, the affront to fair play and decency
must be disproportionate to the societal interest in prosecution of criminal
cases.

 

    I
move from the general principle to the concerns raised by the Crown's conduct
in this case.  The submissions made to us, as reflected in the reasons of Cory
J., focused in part on the issue of whether there was evidence of prosecutorial
misconduct or bad faith in this case.  While these may be factors in
determining whether an abuse of process has been established, they are neither
necessary nor sufficient.  In R. v. Keyowski, supra, Wilson
J., speaking for the Court, stated, at p. 659:

 

To
define ""oppressive"" as requiring misconduct or an improper motive
would, in my view, unduly restrict the operation of the doctrine.   In this
case, for example, where there is no suggestion of misconduct, such a
definition would prevent any limit being placed on the number of trials that
could take place.  Prosecutorial misconduct and improper motivation are but two
of many factors to be taken into account when a court is called upon to
consider whether or not in a particular case the Crown's exercise of its
discretion to re-lay the indictment amounts to an abuse of process.

 

    While
prosecutorial misconduct or bad faith per se may not
be at issue, this case raises three concerns which have been addressed by the
courts in the context of abuse of process.   The first is the evil of
""judge-shopping"".  The second is concern for the impartiality of the
administration of justice, both real and perceived.  The third concerns the
need to uphold the dignity of the judiciary and judicial process.

 

    The
concern with ""judge-shopping"" arises from the use of the stay to
avoid the consequences of an unfavourable ruling.  Normally, Crown counsel
faced with an unfavourable ruling is expected to accept it.  The remedy is by
way of appeal.  To permit the Crown to stay a proceeding because of an
unfavourable ruling and then reinstate the proceeding before a different judge
in the hope of a different ruling is obviously to condone, in some sense,
judge-shopping, notwithstanding that the Crown's motive may have been honourable.

 

    Such
conduct also raises concern for the impartiality of the administration of
justice, real and perceived.  The use of the power to stay, combined with
reinstitution of proceedings as a means of avoiding an unfavourable ruling,
gives the Crown an advantage not available to the accused.  An accused's only
remedy for an unfavourable ruling is an appeal: the Crown, if conduct such as
that raised in this case is condoned, has a choice of whether to stay and start
afresh before a new judge or to appeal.  Absolute equality between the
prosecution and the defence may not be possible.  But good reasons must exist
if the Crown, which already has at its disposal the superior resources of the
state, is to be given an advantage such as this.

 

    Finally,
the case raises concerns for the dignity of the judiciary and the integrity of
the judicial process.   The normal and proper operation of the judicial system
contemplates that judicial errors be corrected through the appeal process. 
That process should not be subverted without good reason.   From the point of
view of theory, an order or ruling stands as valid until set aside on appeal. 
Any other assumption leads to uncertainty and confusion.   It may, moreover,
result in the ""error"" of one trial judge being implicitly
""corrected"" by another judge of the same level.  This is precisely
what happened in the case at bar;  Locke Dist. Ct. J. was called upon to quash
the second proceeding, and German Dist. Ct. J. was called upon during that
proceeding to make a ruling at odds with that of the first judge.  
Lamer J. (as he then was) warned against these evils in R. v.
Moore, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 1097, at p. 1130, a case concerned
with the legitimacy of new proceedings after the quashing of an information for
failure to allege a material averment:

 

. . .
this is no reason to allow the Crown to lay an amended charge once the accused
has been acquitted, albeit by error.  The trial judge's decision is open to
appeal.   Assuming error is found, the Court of Appeal will direct him to amend
and hear the case, or will amend the charge itself and then return the file to
the judge for trial on the amended charge.  The fact that this will result in
the accused being tried on the amended charge in any event, is no reason for
downgrading the ""quashing"" so as to permit the Crown to relay an
amended charge without facing a special plea.  When a judge quashes under s.
529, that decision is deemed without error until reversed by a Court of
Appeal.   Otherwise the second judge, ordinarily of the same jurisdiction, when
assessing whether the ""quashing"" is or is not tantamount to an
acquittal for the purpose of determining whether there is autrefois
acquit, would have to determine whether his colleague was or
was not in error in deciding to quash.

 

    These
concerns are underlined in  a series of cases dealing with the refusal by a
trial judge to grant the Crown's request for an adjournment, usually as a
result of the unavailability of a key witness.  In the first of the three cases
I will refer to, the Crown stayed proceedings pursuant to s. 508 of the Code and
then laid a new information in order to re-institute proceedings.   In the
latter two cases, the Crown simply attempted to withdraw the charge with a view
to relaying it and proceeding when the witness relied upon was available.   I
propose to quote from each of these three cases -- all of which resulted in the
Court's ordering a stay of proceedings -- in order to capture some of the
concerns to which I have alluded:

 

    It is not the function of this Court to review the
discretion of the Judge who refused the adjournment of the first information.  
Whatever dilemma the prosecution may face in subjecting a discretionary ruling
of a lower Court to the scrutiny of a higher Court, the procedural expediency
adopted in this case cannot be countenanced as a substitute for an appeal or
prerogative proceeding . . . .

 

    It
is not too difficult to contemplate the evils where such a procedure could be
extended to manoeuvre any trial proceeding before a Judge of choice.

 

Per Jones Prov. Ct. J. in R. v. McAnish and
Cook (1973), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 494 (B.C.), at p. 495.

 

It seems quite apparent that the purported withdrawal of
the informations at that stage after an unsuccessful attempt for an
adjournment, was a move designed to circumvent the Judge's ruling which they
found unsatisfactory . . . .   The Crown have [sic] simply
ignored the dismissals of the Court and re-laid the informations . . . .

 

    When the accused is brought back to face the same
charge, that was disposed of by the Court, without any ruling by a higher Court
as to the propriety of the lower Court's ruling, it does not appear to the
accused or the public, that the administration of justice is impartial, but
rather that it is something to be manipulated by the Crown.

 

Per Crossland Prov. Ct. J. in R. v. Scheller (No. 1)
(1976), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 273 (Ont.), at pp. 278 and 283.

 

I find
that the procedure adopted by the Crown in this case of withdrawing the charge
and re-laying it subsequently was calculated to circumvent the Judge's refusal
to grant an adjournment.  It was an affront to the dignity both of the
Provincial Court Judge and the relevant appellate authorities.  More important,
it constituted an attack upon the judicial system itself by an endeavour to
bypass or disregard judicial authority in an endeavour to take the control of a
criminal proceeding out of the hands of the appropriate judicial officer.

 

Per Vanek Prov. Ct. J. in R. v. Weightman and
Cunningham (1977), 37 C.C.C. (2d) 303 (Ont.), at pp. 317-18.

 

    I
recognize that each of these cases can be readily distinguished from the
present case;  indeed, a key factor mentioned in R. v. McAnish and
Cook was that the Crown laid a new information instead of
proceeding as permitted by s. 508(2)  of the Criminal Code , as the
Crown did here.   Nevertheless, the concerns which they enunciate are the very
concerns raised in this case.   They suggest at the very least that each
concern must be carefully considered to ensure that the unfairness and
oppressiveness amounting to abuse of process are not present here.

 

Application
of the Law to the Facts of This Case

 

    The
Court of Appeal found there was no abuse of process or Charter 
violation in the Crown's staying of proceedings before the first judge after
the adverse ruling, and then recommencing them before a new judge.  It stated
that Crown counsel was not simply circumventing an unfavourable ruling, but was
protecting an important public interest. Observing that the use of a stay must
remain subject to judicial review, it concluded that ""having regard to the
public interests with which the Crown was concerned, there was compelling
reason to stay the proceedings"".

 

    In
essence, the Court of Appeal is saying that the use of a stay to circumvent an
adverse ruling is legitimate because the Crown had a good reason founded in
public interest for following the course it did.  I question whether such
reasoning is sufficient to avoid the inference of abuse of process.   As this
Court stated in Keyowski, supra, the
Crown's good faith and motive are only two of the factors to be considered in
determining whether an abuse of process is made out.    The same has repeatedly
been held with respect to Charter  breaches; under the Charter  lack of
good faith and motive are irrelevant on the question of whether the accused's
rights have been breached, although they may be considered under s. 24(2)  in
determining the use to which evidence obtained as a result of a breach may be
put.   It would appear at least necessary to take the further step of examining
the magnitude of the affront to justice and fairness against the public
interest in prosecution.  The reasoning of the Court of Appeal, moreover, fails
to fully address the real concerns raised by the Crown's conduct -- concerns
relating to judge-shopping, the impartiality of the administration of justice
and the integrity and dignity of the judicial process.

 

    I
have the same concerns with regard to the reasons of my colleague, Cory J.  
He, too, emphasizes that the Crown acted in good faith and that its actions
were not abusive, in the sense that they were aimed at protecting the identity
of a police informer.  This, while relevant, is insufficient in itself to
justify an abuse of process.

 

    Cory
J. makes two further points.  The Crown, he says, had no alternative but to
stay the trial in order to fulfil its duty.  I cannot agree.  The Crown, faced
with the evidentiary ruling which might have led to disclosure of the
informer's identity, could have stood the witness down and declined to call
further evidence.   The result would probably have been an acquittal.   The
Crown then could have appealed the acquittal on the ground of the judge's
erroneous ruling in the usual way, asking for a new trial.    This is what
happened in R. v. Banas and Haverkamp (1982), 36 O.R.
(2d) 164.  There the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed an appeal from an
acquittal made after the Crown declined to lead evidence following an adverse
ruling.  Martin J.A. stated at p. 169:

 

    We
do not think that the Crown, in the circumstances, is precluded from appealing
the directed verdict because Crown counsel decided not to continue with the
trial which he considered would be fruitless and which would not result in a
conviction due to the erroneous exclusion of vital evidence.  We are satisfied
that if the trial judge had not excluded the evidence of the intercepted
private communications the verdict of the jury would not necessarily have been
the same.

 

    If
the Crown had followed this course in the case at bar the concerns to which I
have alluded would have been avoided.   The Crown could not be accused of
judge-shopping, since the new trial would be the result of a court decision
rather than a Crown decision.  Concerns for the impartiality of the
administration of justice would not arise, since the critical decision would be
made by the Court of Appeal where the accused may be fully heard.   And the
integrity and dignity of the judicial process would be preserved, in that the
adverse ruling would not be circumvented by the act of the Crown, but would be
properly set aside by an appellate court.

 

    Finally,
Cory J. alludes to the fact that the accused was not prejudiced by way of delay
since he was at all times in custody on another matter.  Generally speaking
(and leaving to one side the question of trial delay under s. 11 (b) of the Charter  where
differing views have been expressed) it is not incumbent upon an accused to
demonstrate actual prejudice as a condition of being able to rely on his Charter 
rights.  Nor does prejudice figure prominently in the jurisprudence on abuse of
process.

 

    Finding
myself unconvinced by the reasons enunciated in the court below or by Cory J.
for the proposition that abuse of process or breach of the Charter  has not
been made out, I find it necessary to embark on my own analysis.  Guidance as
to the content of ""oppressive"", ""vexatious"" and
""contrary to the fundamental principles of justice"", the basic test
for abuse of process, may be had from the cases which have considered that
doctrine.  Those cases invoke concerns for the fairness of the process from the
vantage point of the accused as well as the public interest in proper
functioning of the judicial system.   The specific concerns raised in this case
involve the spectre of judge-shopping, concern for impartiality of the judicial
process, and concern for the maintenance of the integrity and dignity of the
judicial system and the judges within it.   These concerns must be balanced
against the public interest in prosecuting crimes to ascertain whether they
outweigh that interest with the result that allowing the proceedings to stand
would tarnish the image of the court.

 

    Each
of the concerns I have raised may be seen to involve a fundamental principle of
justice underlying our community's sense of fair play and justice.   A system
that allows the Crown an advantage in choosing or changing judges, a system
which either in fact or appearance is partial, a system which permits a judge's
ruling to be circumvented other than by the normal appeal process -- such a
system would be open to the charge that it offended the fundamental principles
of justice upon which our society rests.  By the same token, proceedings which
permit such abuses might be characterized as ""vexatious"" or
""unfair"".

 

    The
question is whether the apparent concerns are of such gravity that they may be
said to outweigh the public interest.  In my view the answer is yes.   The
public has an interest in prosecuting crimes as well as in protecting the
identity of informers.   But, as I have already suggested, both these interests
could have been met by adopting the alternative of calling no further evidence
and appealing the resulting acquittal.   In these circumstances, it cannot be
said that the public interest justifies or offsets the affront to justice and
fairness involved in the course the Crown chose to follow.   The situation,
moreover, falls within the rubric of ""the clearest of cases"".   The
deviation from the fundamental principles of justice is clear and, being
unnecessary, incapable of justification.   I conclude that the requirements for
abuse of process are clearly met in this case.

 

    I
conclude that the Crown's conduct in staying the proceedings to avoid an adverse
judicial ruling and then recommencing them establishes the case for abuse of
process.  Having so concluded, it is unnecessary to consider the position under
the Charter . I leave the question of remedy to later in these
reasons.

 

The
Trial Judge's Refusal to Receive the Evidence of Ross

 

    In
the course of the second trial, the trial judge granted an adjournment so the
defence could subpoena a witness named Ross whom the defence wished to question
on the issue of entrapment.  Ross did not arrive until counsel for the Crown
and for one of the accused had completed their submissions. The trial judge
refused to permit Ross to be called at this stage.

 

    The
record in the case on appeal reveals there was evidence that the first
conversation between the police officer and the appellant took place at Ross's
auto body shop, that the police officer had previous knowledge of Ross, and
that the police officer and Ross were talking when the appellant arrived.  
There was also evidence that the appellant had bought a car from Ross which he
later used as collateral in the drug transaction with the police officer.  
And, finally, there was evidence that Ross was arrested ""in relation to
these matters"", simultaneously with the appellant and his co-accused, and
that there were no reasonable and probable grounds to arrest Ross.   The
charges against Ross were not proceeded with.

 

    This
evidence suggests that Ross was connected with the transaction giving rise to
the charges.  It is sufficient to raise questions about the nature of his
involvement.  One of the explanations might have been that he assisted in
entrapping the accused.  Notwithstanding the lack of other positive evidence to
that point indicating entrapment, I cannot concur in the view that there was
""no real basis for permitting Ross to testify"".

 

    Notwithstanding
the possible relevance of Ross's evidence, I would not interfere with the trial
judge's exercise of her discretion to refuse to hear Ross, had the proposed
evidence related to the merits of the case.

 

    This,
however, was not the case in my view.  Ross's evidence was tendered not on the
principal question of guilt or innocence, but on the subsidiary issue of
entrapment.   The issue of entrapment must be determined apart from the issue
of guilt or innocence: R. v. Mack, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903.   It is a
policy-related issue.  The only question is whether the entrapment constitutes
an abuse of process requiring that the proceedings be stayed or set aside.  
The distinction between the question of guilt or innocence, and the subsidiary
issue of entrapment, is underlined by the fact that in a jury trial the issue
of entrapment is decided by the trial judge alone, after the jury has returned
its verdict on the guilt or innocence of the accused.

 

    This
Court has not yet laid down a definitive procedure to govern the issue of
entrapment, apart from emphasizing that the question is separate from the trial per se.  As
Lamer J. (as he then was) stated in Mack, at p. 972:

 

. . .
the guilt or innocence of the accused must be determined apart from evidence
which is relevant only to the issue of entrapment. This protects the right of
an accused to an acquittal where the circumstances so warrant.  If the jury
decides the accused has committed all of the elements of the crime, it is then
open to the judge to stay the proceedings because of entrapment by refusing to
register a conviction.  It is not necessary nor advisable in this case to
expand on the details of procedure . . . . the guilt or innocence of the
accused is not in issue at the time an entrapment claim is to be decided
. . . .

 

    At
the time when Ross appeared, the trial on the issue of guilt or innocence was
in the process of being concluded.  The evidence was in and the submissions of
law were underway.  The question is whether it was too late at this point to
raise the issue of entrapment.   The trial judge held it was, treating the
issue of entrapment as one which must be raised in the course of the trial
proper.   Thus she said: ""There is no evidence in this trial that
[Ross] would assist in an entrapment defence.  So I can't see the
purpose.""  [Emphasis added.]

 

    Following
the logic in Mack, I think the answer to the question
of whether it was too late to receive the evidence of Ross because the
relevance of his evidence had not been established in the course of the trial
must be negative.  Without deciding that evidence of entrapment cannot or
should not be led during the course of a trial directed to determining the
guilt or innocence of the accused, Mack seems to make it
clear that the decision on entrapment is one which must be made separately from
the issue of guilt or innocence.  In these circumstances, I think the accused
should have the right, if he or she wishes, to call evidence as to entrapment, after
the case on guilt or innocence is completed.  In many cases, it will be to the
advantage of the accused to delay the evidence on entrapment to this stage. 
For example, the accused might not wish to take the stand during the trial of
guilt or innocence, as is his or her right, but might wish to do so later on
the subsequent issue of entrapment.  Implicit in the notion of entrapment is
the concession of having committed at least the actus reus of the
offence; fairness suggests that the accused should not be obliged to call
evidence on this question until after the principal issue of his or her guilt
or innocence has been determined.  This is the logic behind the separation of
process dictated by Mack.

 

    In
consequence, I am of the view that the trial judge did not have a discretion to
refuse to accept the evidence of Ross on the issue of entrapment, provided that
relevancy -- the basic condition of the reception of any evidence -- was
established.   The guilt or innocence of the accused not yet having been determined,
the question of entrapment had not yet arisen for decision.  The accused was
entitled, if he chose, to call evidence relevant to entrapment after the
verdict on his guilt.  The trial judge did not let him do this.  Unless the
evidence was clearly irrelevant, that constituted an error.  As I have already
indicated, it was far from clear that Ross's evidence would have been
irrelevant; one explanation for Ross's connection with the transaction could
have been that he was used to entrap the accused.

 

Remedy

 

    The
appellant asks that the appeal be allowed and for a stay of proceedings or a
new trial.  Were the only error that of refusal to hear Ross, I would be
inclined to direct a hearing on the issue of entrapment.  However, the Crown's
use of a stay and recommencement of proceedings constitutes an abuse of process
which could not be rectified by a new trial.  This suggests that the proper
result is to allow the appeal and enter a stay of proceedings.

 

Conclusion

 

    I
would allow the appeal and enter a stay of proceedings.

 

//Sopinka J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    SOPINKA J.
(dissenting) -- I have had the advantage of reading the judgment prepared in
this appeal by Justice Cory.  I agree with my colleague's reasons in respect of
the appellant's arguments concerning s. 508 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, and the cross-examination of the police officer.  I am
further of the view that the learned trial judge properly exercised her
discretion in refusing to issue a material witness warrant.  However, I
respectfully disagree with my colleague on the issue of the propriety of the
trial judge's refusal to reopen the case to permit the appellant to call the
witness Ross, once it became apparent that Ross had appeared.  With respect to
this issue I agree with the conclusion reached by Justice McLachlin and with
her reasons.

 

    Notwithstanding
error on the part of the trial judge, it does not follow that there need be a
new trial.  In view of the procedure required by R. v. Mack, [1988]
2 S.C.R. 903, the substantive verdict of guilty rendered by the trial judge
need not be disturbed, since the evidence relevant to a Mack
application is not relevant to culpability:  Mack, supra, at pp.
965, 972 and 975.  In order to rectify the error and restore the appellant's
opportunity to make full answer and defence, it is only necessary to vacate the
formal conviction and remit the matter to the trial judge for an evidentiary
hearing on the issue of entrapment.  I would so order.

    THE COURT ‑‑
The present petition seeks to have quashed an appeal entered as of right
pursuant to s. 691(1) (a) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , that is on a question of law on which it is
claimed a judge of the Court of Appeal dissents.  In instructing the jury, the
trial judge must explain the applicable law in a clear and accurate manner as
it relates to the facts.  In doing this, he must choose judiciously from the
evidence presented to discuss particular points with which the jury might need
help.  It was in respect of this second task that the dissenting judge found
the charge inadequate.  By agreeing with the majority on all other points on
appeal, he indicated that the trial judge had presented the law in an adequate
way.  His dissent was, thus, not on a question of law but on his appreciation
of the adequacy of the facts selected by the trial judge in performing the
second task mentioned.  The motion to quash the appeal is therefore granted.

    The

was insanity, but this defence was rejected by the jury. The Court of Appeal
upheld the conviction. This appeal is to determine (1) whether s. 16(4)  of the Criminal
Code , which provides that ""Every one shall, until the
contrary is proved, be presumed to be and to have been sane"", infringes
the presumption of innocence guaranteed in s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ; and, if so, whether s. 16(4)  is
justifiable under s. 1  of the Charter ; (2) whether the
meaning of the word ""wrong"" in s. 16(2) of the Code should
be restricted to ""legally wrong""; (3) whether s. 16(3) of the Code
provides an alternative defence if the conditions of s. 16(2)  were not met; and
(4) whether the trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to split its case by
presenting its evidence with respect to the sanity of the accused in rebuttal.

 

    Held
(L'Heureux-Dubé, Sopinka and McLachlin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

(1)
Presumption of Sanity/Presumption of Innocence

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and Lamer C.J. and La Forest, Sopinka and Cory JJ.: The insanity defence
under s. 16 of the Code should be characterized as an
exemption from criminal liability which is based on an incapacity for criminal
intent. This claim for an exemption will usually be manifested under s. 16
either as a denial of mens rea  in the particular case or as an
excuse for what would otherwise be a criminal offence.

 

    Section
16(4) of the Code infringes the presumption of
innocence guaranteed in s. 11 (d) of the Charter . The
real concern under s. 11 (d) is not whether the accused must disprove an element or
prove an excuse, but whether an accused may be convicted while a reasonable
doubt exists.  When that possibility exists, there is a breach of the
presumption of innocence. Accordingly, it is the final effect of the impugned
provision on the verdict that is decisive. Whether the claim of insanity is
characterized as a denial of mens rea, an excusing defence or, more
generally, an exemption based on criminal incapacity, s. 16(4)  allows a factor
which is essential for guilt to be presumed, rather than proved by the Crown
beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, the section requires an accused to
disprove sanity (or prove insanity) on a balance of probabilities. Section
16(4)  therefore violates the presumption of innocence because it permits a
conviction in spite of a reasonable doubt in the mind of the trier of fact as
to the guilt of the accused. Finally, while the verdict under s. 16  is
""not guilty by reason of insanity"", the accused raising the
s. 16  defence is seeking a ""true acquittal"" vis‑à‑vis the
attachment of criminal culpability and is entitled to the presumption of
innocence.

 

    Section
16(4) of the Code constitutes a reasonable limit on the
presumption of innocence. The objective of s. 16(4), which is a purely
evidentiary section, is to avoid placing on the Crown the impossibly onerous
burden of disproving insanity and to thereby secure the conviction of the
guilty. This objective is of sufficient importance to warrant limiting a constitutionally
protected right. The means chosen by the government are proportional to the
objective. First, the presumption of sanity and the reverse onus embodied in
s. 16(4) are rationally connected to the objective. Second, s. 16(4)
impairs s. 11 (d) as little as possible. To reduce the burden on the
accused to a mere evidentiary burden would not achieve the objective as
effectively. While s. 16 is seldom raised, given the substantial
constraint on liberty which follows a successful insanity plea, if insanity were
easier for an accused to establish, the defence would be successfully invoked
more often. Parliament may not have chosen the absolutely least intrusive means
of meeting the objective, but it has chosen from a range of means which impair
s. 11 (d) as little as is reasonably possible. It is not the
role of this Court to second‑guess the wisdom of policy choices made by
Parliament. Third, there is proportionality between the effects of the measure
and the objective. The burden on the accused is not the full criminal burden;
rather, the accused is required to prove his insanity on a balance of
probabilities. Section 16(4) represents a compromise of three important
societal interests:  avoiding a virtually impossible burden on the Crown;
convicting the guilty; and acquitting those who truly lack the capacity for
criminal intent. The alternatives to this compromise raise their own Charter 
problems and give no guarantee as to whether they will achieve the objective.

 

    Per
L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ.: The insanity provisions of the Code relate
to the basic preconditions for criminal responsibility rather than to essential
elements or defences to criminal offences. The latter approach ignores the
historical and philosophical origins of the fundamental precept of the criminal
law system that the attribution of criminal responsibility and punishment is
justifiable only for those who have the capacity to reason and choose between
right and wrong. The accused must be sane before any consideration of the essential
elements of the offence or exculpatory defences becomes relevant. This approach
also violates the language of s. 16 of the Code, which
refers to capacity for criminal responsibility rather than actual states of
mind. It is at odds with the fact that insanity in s. 16 can be raised by the
Crown in circumstances where neither the elements of the offence nor a defence
are at issue. Further, it confuses true acquittal, the result of the absence of
an essential element of an offence or the presence of a defence to it, with
formal acquittal coupled with alternative coercive measures because mental
impairment renders the imposition of true penal responsibility inappropriate.

 

    The
presumption of sanity in s. 16(4) of the Code, viewed
as the fundamental precondition of criminal responsibility, does not offend the
presumption of innocence embodied in s. 11 (d) of the Charter , nor
does it offend the fundamental notion of procedural fairness which underlies
the procedural guarantees of the Charter . The presumption
of sanity merely relieves the Crown from establishing that the accused has the
capacity for choice which makes attribution of criminal responsibility and
punishment justifiable. The Crown must still prove the accused's guilt -- i.e.,
the actus reus, the mens rea, and the absence of exculpatory
defences raised on the evidence -- beyond a reasonable doubt. The presumption
of innocence reflects the fundamental precepts upon which our legal system and
our Charter  are based. There is no suggestion that the present
system results in injustice. Accused persons appear to have no difficulty
establishing insanity on a balance of probabilities where it exists.

 

    Per Wilson
J.: Section 16(4) of the Code infringes s. 11 (d) of the  Charter . The
presumption of sanity requires the accused to establish his insanity on a
balance of probabilities. However one conceives the plea of insanity, whether
as an exemption, a defence, a justification or an excuse, the persuasive burden
imposed on the accused by s. 16(4)  permits him to be convicted of a crime
notwithstanding a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. Under s. 11(d), it is
the net effect of a reverse onus provision on the final guilt or innocence of
the accused rather than the precise nature of the provision that must be examined.

 

    Section
16(4) of the Code does not constitute a reasonable and
demonstrably justified limit on the presumption of innocence under s. 1  of the Charter . The
objective of s. 16(4)  is to prevent perfectly sane persons who have committed 
crimes to escape criminal liability on tenuous insanity pleas. But nothing
indicates that successfully fabricated insanity pleas have given rise to an
existing pressing and substantial concern. While the legislature may not
necessarily wait until such a concern has arisen, the Crown has not succeeded
in establishing even a likelihood of its arising. The American experience does
not support the contention that a lower standard of proof would result in more
people being acquitted by reason of insanity. Further, several reports from
Canada and other countries propose that the burden of proving insanity should
be made an evidential one. This burden on the accused is seen as a sufficiently
high threshold to prevent insanity pleas in cases where there is only tenuous
support for such a plea.

 

    In
any event, s. 16(4) does not meet the proportionality test. It is rationally
connected to the legislative objective but does not impair the accused's right
to be presumed innocent as little as is reasonably possible. It is
inappropriate in this case to apply the deferential standard of review on the
""minimal impairment"" issue. The government does not mediate between
different groups but acts as the singular antagonist of a very basic legal
right of the accused. The government's objective in this case could be met by
imposing a purely evidentiary burden on the accused. The possibility of a
successful feigned insanity plea diminishes as scientific knowledge about
mental illness increases. The burden on the prosecution, while it would not be
an easy one, would nevertheless not be an ""impossible onerous
burden"". In the absence of s. 16(4) the onus would still be on the accused
to adduce evidence that makes insanity a live issue fit and proper to be left
to the jury. The burden on the Crown would then be to remove any doubt in the
jury's mind as to the presence of any of the elements of insanity as set out in
ss. 16(2) and 16(3). There is no hard evidence that putting a lower burden on
the accused would result in more guilty people escaping criminal liability on
tenuous insanity pleas. Section 16(4) is accordingly not saved by s. 1  of the Charter . It
follows that the common law principle which is reflected in s. 16(4)  also
infringes s. 11 (d) and is not saved by s. 1 .

 

(2) Meaning of
""Wrong""

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and Lamer C.J. and Wilson, La Forest, Gonthier and Cory JJ.: The word
""wrong"" in s. 16(2) should be interpreted to mean ""morally
wrong"" and not ""legally wrong"". This Court's judgment in Schwartz
v. The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 673, is overruled. Under s. 16(2), the
courts must determine whether the accused, because of a disease of the mind,
was rendered incapable of knowing that the act committed was something that he
ought not to have done. To do so, the inquiry cannot terminate with the
discovery that the accused knew that the act was contrary to the formal law. A
person may well be aware that an act is contrary to law but, by reason of
disease of the mind, is at the same time incapable of knowing that the act is
morally wrong in the circumstances according to the moral standards of society.
The trial judge, therefore, erred in directing the jury that the insanity
defence was not available under s. 16(2) of the Code if the
accused knew, at the time of committing the offence, that the act was contrary
to the laws of Canada.  In view of the trial judge's error, a new trial should
be ordered.

 

    Per
L'Heureux-Dubé, Sopinka and McLachlin JJ. (dissenting): The question under s.
16(2) of the Code is not whether the accused thought an
act was morally or legally wrong but whether he was incapable of knowing that
he ought not to do it. If the accused is capable of knowing that the act was in
some sense ""wrong"", then it is neither unfair nor unjust to submit
the accused to criminal responsibility and penal sanction. The word
""wrong"" in s. 16(2) should therefore be construed to mean simply that
which one ""ought not to do"", for whatever reasons, legal or moral.
The wording of s. 16(2), the history and the purpose of the insanity
provisions, as well as the difficulty of determining in every situation what is
morally wrong, support that conclusion.

 

(3) Specific
Delusions

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and Lamer C.J. and La Forest, Gonthier and Cory JJ.: As a result of this
Court's reconsideration of the meaning of the word ""wrong"" in
s. 16(2), any successful attempt to invoke the insanity defence under
s. 16(3) of the Code would also succeed under
s. 16(2).  Furthermore, if an accused fails to satisfy the conditions set
out in s. 16(2), he will not be able to benefit from s. 16(3). It would
not, therefore, assist an accused in any way if s. 16(3) was held to
constitute a separate and independent defence.

 

    Per
L'Heureux-Dubé, Sopinka and McLachlin JJ.: Assuming that s. 16(3) of the Code
relating to specific delusions can arise where the conditions of s. 16(2) are
not met, the trial judge left open this possibility to the jury and his
instructions were adequate.

 

    Per Wilson
J.: While most cases of specific delusions under s. 16(3) of the Code will
now be caught under the second branch of s. 16(2), there may still be
""specific delusions"" which are not necessarily attributable to a
""disease of the mind"". Since legislative provisions should not
readily be held to be redundant, particularly ones which are favourable to the accused,
it is preferable to leave s. 16(3) open to an accused who might not qualify for
the insanity defence under the second branch of s. 16(2).

 

(4) Splitting
the Case

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and Lamer C.J. and Wilson, La Forest, Gonthier and Cory JJ.: The trial
judge correctly permitted the Crown to adduce evidence with respect to sanity
in rebuttal. While the Crown must tender, as part of its case, evidence that
will establish the existence of all elements of the offence with which the
accused is charged, the Crown need not adduce evidence in chief to challenge a
defence that an accused might possibly raise. This principle is not altered by
the fact that the accused may warn the Crown that it intends to raise a
particular defence.  Further, a requirement that the Crown adduce evidence in
chief to establish the sanity of the accused would defeat the presumption
contained in s. 16(4). Finally, since the accused were given the
opportunity for surrebuttal in this case, they did not suffer prejudice as a
result of the fact that the Crown's evidence was adduced in rebuttal rather
than in chief.

 

    Per
L'Heureux-Dubé, Sopinka and McLachlin JJ.: The Crown was entitled to rely on
the presumption of sanity and was under no obligation to present evidence on
this issue as part of its case against the accused. The evidence on insanity
did not relate to an essential element of the offence.

    The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and Lamer C.J. and La Forest and Cory JJ.
was delivered by

 

    Lamer C.J. -‑ This
case involves a constitutional challenge, under s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , to the reverse onus clause contained
in s. 16(4) of the insanity provisions contained in the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  This Court has also been asked
to revisit its interpretation of the meaning of the word ""wrong""
found in s. 16(2) .  There are other issues specific to the appeal which
are set out further on in these reasons.

 

Facts

 

    On
September 3, 1985, the appellants Chaulk and Morrissette entered a home in
Winnipeg, plundered it for valuables and then stabbed and bludgeoned its sole
occupant to death.  A week later they turned themselves in, making full
confessions.

 

    After
a transfer proceeding in the Youth Court (Chaulk and Morrissette were 15 and 16
years of age, respectively), the appellants were tried and convicted of first
degree murder by a jury in the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench.  The only
defence raised was insanity within the meaning of s. 16 of the Code. 
Expert evidence was given at trial that the appellants suffered from a paranoid
psychosis which made them believe that they had the power to rule the world and
that the killing was a necessary means to that end.  They knew the laws of
Canada existed, but believed that they were above the ordinary law; they
thought the law was irrelevant to them.  They thought they had a right to kill
the victim because he was ""a loser"".

 

    An
appeal to the Manitoba Court of Appeal was unanimously dismissed on May 13,
1988.

 

Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

Criminal
Code 

 

    16. (1)  No person shall be convicted of
an offence in respect of an act or omission on his part while that person was
insane.

 

    (2)  For the purposes of this section, a person is
insane when the person is in a state of natural imbecility or has disease of the
mind to an extent that renders the person incapable of appreciating the nature
and quality of an act or omission or of knowing that an act or omission is
wrong.

 

    (3)  A person who has specific delusions, but is in
other respects sane, shall not be acquitted on the ground of insanity unless
the delusions caused that person to believe in the existence of a state of
things that, if it existed, would have justified or excused the act or omission
of that person.

 

    (4) 
Every one shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to be and to have
been sane.

Lower
Court Judgments

 

Manitoba
Court of Queen's Bench

 

    The
appellants were tried before Ferg J., sitting with a jury, in the Court of
Queen's Bench.  They were convicted of first degree murder.  The only defence
raised at trial was insanity and this defence was rejected by the jury.  Chaulk
and Morrissette were sentenced to life imprisonment without eligibility for
parole for a period of twenty‑five years.

 

Manitoba
Court of Appeal (O'Sullivan J.A. for the Court)

 

    The
appellants appealed their conviction to the Manitoba Court of Appeal on the
grounds that s. 16(4) violated the Charter ; that
the trial judge had erred in his charge to the jury on s. 16(3)  and on the
effect of mental impairment on the ability to plan and deliberate; that the
trial judge had erred in refusing to answer specific questions of the jury
regarding ss. 16(2)  and 16(3) ; that the trial judge erred in not ordering
separate trials for the two accused and in admitting certain statements by the
accused Chaulk to a counsellor without a voir dire; and
that the trial judge erred in refusing a defence motion for particulars.

 

    The
Court of Appeal was of the view that Ferg J.'s charge to the jury and his
answers to their queries ""fairly set out the issues for the jury's
consideration"".  The court held that any reasonable jury would, if
properly instructed, reject the defence of insanity in this case.  O'Sullivan J.A.
stated:

 

    In my opinion, the evidence shows that the accused
were suffering from megalomania, but it is clear that they knew and fully
appreciated the nature and consequences of their acts and they knew that what
they were doing was legally wrong (see R. v. Abbey (1982),
29 C.R. (3d) 193).  There was no evidence of any specific delusions.

 

                                                                        . . .

 

    In
my opinion, medically insane people can be made responsible for their acts if
the insanity does not fall within the provisions of s. 16  of the Criminal Code .

 

The
court rejected the argument that the onus provisions of s. 16(4) of the Code
contravened s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  Relying on its
judgment in R. v. Godfrey (1984), 11
C.C.C. (3d) 233, the court held that s. 16(4)  was not inconsistent
with the Charter .  O'Sullivan J.A. was of the opinion
that the argument against the presumption of sanity was potentially threatening
to liberty, given that insanity may be raised by the Crown or by the judge.  He
stated that if there were no presumption of sanity, ""it would be open to a
jury to condemn a prisoner to incarceration as an insane person if they had a
reasonable doubt as to his sanity"".

 

    As
regards the admission of Chaulk's statement in the absence of a voir dire, the
Court of Appeal held that the statement had not been made to a person in
authority and found no reversible error in Ferg J.'s decision to admit the
statement without a voir dire.

 

Issues

 

    The
following constitutional questions were stated by Dickson C.J. on July 13,
1989:

 

1.Is s. 16(4) of the Criminal Code  of
Canada inconsistent with s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If the
answer to question 1 is yes, is s. 16(4) justified by s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with
the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    The
appellants raise three further issues in this Court:

 

3.What is the interpretation of the word
""wrong"" which is found in s. 16(2)  of the Criminal
Code  of Canada?  Is its meaning restricted to ""legally
wrong"" or may it also be interpreted more broadly to include ""legally
or morally wrong""?

 

4.What interpretation should be given to s. 16(3) 
of the Criminal Code  of Canada?  Should the section have been left to the
jury in the case at bar, and if so, what are the necessary jury instructions?

 

5.[Did]
the learned trial judge err in permitting the Crown to split its case and call
the bulk of its case in purported rebuttal?

 

Analysis

 

Is s. 16(4)
of the Code inconsistent with s. 11(d) of the Charter?

 

    Section
16(4) of the Code sets out a presumption of sanity. 
This presumption can be rebutted if ""the contrary is proved"".   In Smythe v.
The King, [1941] S.C.R. 17, this Court held that when
insanity is raised by the defence, the accused must prove that he or she was
insane, at the time of the offence, on a balance of probabilities.  In R. v.
Simpson (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 337 (Ont. C.A.),
Martin J.A., citing Smythe at p. 363, stated:

 

    It is,
of course, well established that where the accused alleges that he was insane
at the time of the commission of the act the onus on the accused to prove
insanity is discharged by proof of insanity on the balance of probabilities:
...

 

    The
appellant Morrissette argues that the words ""until the contrary is
proved"" in s. 16(4) should be interpreted, based on common law, so as
to require an accused to merely raise a reasonable doubt as to his insanity. 
He assumes that if the words were given this interpretation, s. 16(4)
would not violate the presumption of innocence and it would not be necessary to
address the Charter  arguments in this case.

 

    In
my view, the words ""until the contrary is proved"" cannot be
interpreted as requiring an accused merely to discharge an evidentiary burden
(i.e., raise a reasonable doubt as to insanity); the words in s. 16(4)
clearly impose a persuasive burden on the accused.  In R. v.
Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, Dickson C.J. discussed the
different types of presumptions which exist in criminal law in the context of
deciding whether s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act placed
an evidentiary or a persuasive burden on the accused.  The provision in
question required an accused to ""establish"" that he was not in
possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking.  Dickson C.J. stated
that the phrase ""to establish"" is equivalent to the phrase ""to
prove"", and that the use of the word ""establish"" implied that
the accused had to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he or she was not
in possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking (pp. 114‑18). 
It is clear from the reasoning in Oakes that a provision
which presumes the existence of some fact (in this case, sanity) ""until
the contrary is proved"", places a burden on an accused wishing to rebut
this fact to prove the contrary (insanity) on a balance of probabilities.

 

    Accordingly,
it is necessary, in this case, to measure s. 16(4) against s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

    The
appellants argue that the requirement that an accused person prove his or her
insanity on a balance of probabilities is contrary to the presumption of
innocence, guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  In
order to resolve this question one must consider the nature of the insanity
provisions in our criminal law.

 

    The
Nature of the Insanity Provisions

 

    There
is controversy in academic circles as to whether insanity operates to negate a
""condition precedent"" to legal responsibility or whether it operates
as a defence in the sense that it negates mens rea.  Let
me begin by saying that I will use the term ""defence"" to describe a
claim of insanity under s. 16 , but only in the broad, general sense of the
term which means ""any answer which defeats a criminal charge"" (Law
Reform Commission of Canada, Working Paper 29, Criminal Law:  The
General Part -- Liability and Defences (1982), at
p. 35), or ""any claim which, if accepted, would necessitate an
acquittal"" (Colvin, Principles of Criminal Law (1986), at
p. 163).

 

    It
is true that the exact nature of the insanity defence is very difficult to
ascertain.  The wording of s. 16  itself is not particularly helpful in
this regard.  It tells us that a claim of insanity, if proved, will preclude a
conviction, but it does not tell us whether a claim of insanity negates mens rea,
provides an excuse or justification, or whether it simply exempts an accused
from a criminal conviction on policy grounds.  Other Code
provisions are more explicit; for example, s. 17  tells us that a person
who commits an offence under compulsion of certain threats will be excused
for committing the offence in certain circumstances.

 

    It
is helpful to note, however, that s. 16(1) is worded in a very similar
fashion to s. 13 , which provides:

 

13.  No
person shall be convicted of an offence in respect of an act or omission on his
part while that person was under the age of twelve years.

 

This is
a variation on the common law, which provided that a child under the age of
seven was presumed irrebuttably to be incapable of possessing criminal intent
and that a child between the ages of seven and fourteen was likewise presumed
incapable unless there was clear proof of ""precocity"" so as to
establish a real appreciation of the wrong done (see Perkins and Boyce, Criminal
Law (3rd ed. 1982), c. 8).  Once an accused reached the age of
fourteen, the common law presumption of criminal incapacity disappeared and was
replaced by a rebuttable presumption of capacity for criminal intent.  This
accords with the presumption of sanity which existed at common law (enunciated
via the M'Naghten Rules), was adopted into Canadian criminal law in the
first criminal code (see The Criminal Code , 1892, S.C. 1892,
c. 29, s. 11, and accompanying commentary by Taschereau J. (The
Criminal Code  (1893, at pp. 8-9)), and continues in the current
s. 16(4) .

 

    In
other words, the nature of the insanity defence is revealed if one views the
changing presumptions regarding criminal capacity as a continuum.  At common
law, this continuum began with an irrebuttable presumption that a child under
the age of seven could not have the capacity for criminal intent.  Our current Code
s. 13 provides for an irrebuttable presumption that a child under the age
of twelve has no criminal capacity.  At common law, the continuum provided for
a rebuttable presumption of incapacity for children between the ages of seven
and fourteen.  Perkins and Boyce state ""[t]his presumption is extremely
strong at the age of seven and diminishes gradually until it disappears
entirely at the age of fourteen"" (p. 936).  The current Criminal
Code  cuts off the presumption at age twelve; after a person
reaches the age of twelve the presumption of sanity in s. 16(4)  comes into
play.  Thus, at this end of the continuum, individuals are presumed to have
criminal capacity until such presumption is rebutted on a balance of
probabilities (of course, the Young Offenders Act,
R.S.C., 1985, c. Y-1 , which incorporates a concept of diminished
responsibility, applies to young people between the ages of twelve and
eighteen).

 

    While
the state of insanity and the state of childhood cannot be equated, the
connection between these two situations for the purpose of criminal law is
apparent.  What these two situations have in common is that they both indicate
that the individual in question does not accord with some basic assumptions of
our criminal law model:  that the accused is a rational autonomous being who is
capable of appreciating the nature and quality of an act and of knowing right
from wrong.  With respect to the state of childhood, these basic assumptions
are brought into question because of the immaturity of the individual -‑
he or she has not yet developed the basic capacity which justice and fairness
require be present in a person who is being measured against the standards of
criminal law.  With the state of insanity, these basic assumptions are brought
into question because the accused is suffering from some disease of the mind or
from some delusions which cause him or her to have a frame of reference which
is significantly different than that which most people share.  This mental
condition means that the accused is largely incapable of criminal intent and
should not, therefore, generally be subject to criminal liability in the same
way that sane people are.  (I note here that s. 16  does not exempt all
people with a disease of the mind from criminal liability.  The insanity
defence is defined in a particular way and only if an accused meets those
criteria will his or her mental condition preclude a finding of guilt.)

 

    The
foregoing discussion indicates, in my view, that the insanity provisions
operate, at the most fundamental level, as an exemption from criminal
liability which is predicated on an incapacity for criminal intent. 
However, in particular cases, this basic incapacity may manifest itself in a
number of different ways depending on the claims put forward by the accused.  A
claim of insanity, with its underlying claim of criminal incapacity, could give
rise to a denial of the actus reus or of the mens rea in a
particular case.  For example, an accused could claim that his or her mental
condition is such that when the alleged crime took place, he or she was not
acting consciously.  This is akin to a claim of insane automatism which denies
the essential element of voluntary actus reus on the basis of an
internal cause -‑ the accused's disease of the mind (Rabey v.
The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 513).  An accused could also
raise the argument that his or her mental condition was such that while he or
she was acting consciously and voluntarily, he or she did not have the
requisite mens rea.  For example, a person charged with
murder could claim that while he consciously and voluntarily did the act of
chopping, he thought that he was chopping a loaf of bread in half, when, in
fact, he was chopping off the victim's head (see Kenny's Outlines of
Criminal Law (19th ed. 1966), at p. 83, n. 1).  In such a
case, the insanity claim is manifested as a denial of mens rea.  The
accused had no intention to bring about the consequence of death.  In yet
another case, an accused, charged with murder, could argue that while she
consciously and voluntarily did the act of killing and while she desired to
bring about the death of the victim, she did so because her mental condition
was such that she honestly believed that the victim was evil incarnate and
would destroy the earth if the accused did not kill him.  In such a case, the
insanity claim is manifested not as a denial of actus reus or mens rea, but
rather as a defence in the nature of an excuse or a justification based on the
fact that the accused's mental condition rendered her incapable of knowing that
the act was wrong.  Professor Eric Colvin makes reference to the different
roles played by the insanity defence in ""Exculpatory Defences in Criminal
Law"" (1990), 10 Oxford J. Legal Stud. 381.  He
states (at pp. 394 and 401):

 

    The traditional approach to the insanity defence has
been to conceive of it as negativing all culpability.  Insanity can, of course,
operate either as a special way of denying a mental element of the offence or
as an exculpatory defence. . . .

 

                                                                        . . .

 

Deficient mental capacity may provide the basis for
defences of several different kinds.  Impairment may be used to deny
definitional elements of an offence, or to claim an exculpatory defence which
is specifically geared to the problem of impairment, or to make a special claim
to one of the exculpatory defences which are based on contextual permission.

 

    All
three types of defence can be illustrated by the M'Naghten Rules on insanity at
common law.  The central proposition in the M'Naghten Rules was that the
defence would be available to someone who, because of a `defect of reason'
resulting from `disease of the mind', did not `know the nature and quality of
the act he was doing; or if he did know it, . . . he did not know he
was doing what was wrong'.  The first alternative deals with the situation
where insanity negatives mental elements in the definitions of offences.  The
second alternative establishes a special exculpatory defence which is based on
lack of capacity for normative understanding.   There is, in effect, an
exception to the general rule that `ignorance of the law is no excuse'.  The
third way in which insanity could be relevant to criminal culpability is
through a cognitive breakdown leading to a mistaken belief in a matter of
contextual permission.  This situation was covered in the M'Naghten Rules by a
ruling that responsibility would be determined as if the facts were as they
were believed to be.  [Citations omitted.]

 

    The
foregoing examples illustrate that the insanity defence can be raised in a
number of different ways, depending on the mental condition of the accused. 
All of these examples have one thing in common however.  Each is based on an
underlying claim that the accused has no capacity for criminal intent because
his or her mental condition has brought about a skewed frame of reference. 
When a person claims insanity, he or she may well be denying the existence of mens rea in the
particular case or putting forward an excuse which would preclude criminal
liability in the particular case; but he is also making a more basic claim
which goes beyond mens rea or actus reus in the
particular case -‑ he is claiming that he does not fit within the normal
assumptions of our criminal law model because he does not have the capacity for
criminal intent.  Such a claim may or may not be successful.  If the incapacity
is such that it fits into the defence of insanity encompassed in s. 16 , it
will preclude a conviction.

 

    Based
on the foregoing, I prefer to characterize the insanity defence as an exemption
to criminal liability which is based on an incapacity for criminal intent.  I
note, however, that this basic claim for an exemption will usually be
manifested under s. 16  either as a denial of mens rea in the
particular case or as an excuse for what would otherwise be a criminal offence;
this is because of the way that s. 16  is worded.

 

    The
definition of ""legal insanity"", or insanity which will preclude a
criminal conviction, is found in ss. 16(2) and 16(3) of the Code.  The
first part of s. 16(2)  has come to be known as the ""first arm""
or ""first branch"" of the insanity defence:

 

[A]
person is insane when the person is in a state of natural imbecility or has
disease of the mind to an extent that renders the person incapable of
appreciating the nature and quality of an act or omission . . .

 

In R. v.
Abbey, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 24, this Court held (per Dickson
J., as he then was) that ""appreciat[e] the nature and quality of an act or
omission"" refers to an accused's ability to perceive the consequences,
impact, and results of a physical act and not to an accused's ability to
appreciate that the legal consequences of an act are applicable to him
or her.  Dickson J. stated, in coming to this conclusion, that a delusion
falling under the ""first branch"" of the insanity defence negatives
the element of mens rea, with respect to either the
circumstances or consequences which form part of the actus reus.  Given
the wording of the ""first branch"" of s. 16(2) , this is true in
the vast majority of cases.  A claim of insanity under the ""first
branch"" will be manifested as a denial of mens rea in the
particular case.  It is possible, however, that such a claim could also
manifest itself as a denial of voluntary actus reus in the
particular case.  This was clearly established by the decision of this Court in Rabey which
discussed, inter alia, the defence of insane automatism.

 

    This
Court also held in Abbey that the ""second branch"" of
s. 16(2)  ""is concerned with cognitive capabilities, with knowledge,
and not with appreciation of consequences"" (p. 36).  This provision
is also based on incapacity for criminal intent.  Such incapacity arises
because the accused, due to his mental condition, is incapable of
distinguishing between right and wrong.  This claim of incapacity does not
manifest itself as a denial of mens rea in the particular
case.  The criminal law is not concerned with whether a sane accused knew
that his act was wrong.  Knowledge of wrongness is not part of the requirement
of mens rea.  This is because sane people are presumed to have the
capacity to distinguish between right and wrong ‑- if a sane person is of
the opinion that murder is not wrong, his opinion makes him ""bad"" (as
opposed to ""sick"") because he has the capacity to distinguish
right from wrong.  However, if an accused makes a claim of insanity under
the ""second branch"" of s. 16(2) , he is challenging the
assumption that he is capable of distinguishing between right and wrong.  If it
is proved that his mental condition brought about such incapacity, he will be
excused from criminal liability despite the elements of actus reus and mens rea being
established in the particular case.  Thus, while a claim of insanity under the
""second branch"" is based on the same basic denial of criminal
capacity upon which a claim under the ""first branch"" is based, it is
manifested not as a denial of actus reus or mens rea, but
rather as a claim to be excused for what would otherwise be criminal behaviour.

 

    Based
on the foregoing analysis, I owe it to a certain number of parties in this
appeal to address a particular argument which they raised, to the effect that
the presumption of innocence is not violated by s. 16(4) because an
accused has the benefit of s. 11(d) until
the Crown has proved both actus reus and mens rea, and it
is only after this point that the claim of insanity arises.  A number of
parties have concluded that this means that if an accused fails to satisfy the
jury that he or she was insane within the meaning of s. 16 , it is not that
failure which leads to a conviction, but rather the other evidence about
which the jury must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

    (I
pause here to note that this appeal was heard along with a number of other related
appeals.  This case and R. v. Romeo, [1991]
1 S.C.R. 000, and R. v. Ratti, [1991]
1 S.C.R. 000, all raise the issue of whether s. 16(4) violates
the Charter .  Accordingly, in addressing this constitutional issue
which is common to them all, I have considered and will refer to the arguments
made by all parties (including the various interveners) who submitted
argument on this point.)

 

    The
factum of the Attorney General for New Brunswick in Romeo
expresses the argument as follows:

 

    67.  While undoubtedly there is a connection between
mens rea and the presumption of sanity, the function each serves in the
criminal law process is fundamentally different.  The insanity plea is raised
only when mens rea has been established.  In such circumstances, it becomes
necessary for the defendant to establish that the intent was that of a diseased
mind.  The intent remains, it is not negated.  The mental state giving rise to
that intent is explained.

 

                                                                        . . .

 

    71.  The presumption of innocence means that the
prosecution must establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, both the actus reus and
mens rea of the particular crime.  The burden arising on an insanity plea
assumes that the prosecution has established these elements of the offence.

 

                                                                        .
. .

 

    73. 
... All the presumption does is to require the accused to establish a
particular mental disorder -‑ after the prosecution has established mens
rea.  If the accused fails to satisfy the jury of that disorder on a balance of
probability [sic], he will be convicted not because he is presumed sane
but because the prosecution has otherwise proved the essential elements of the
offence -‑ including mens rea.

 

    In
my respectful opinion, this argument should be rejected for two reasons. 
First, it is not necessarily true that the insanity plea is raised only after mens rea has
been established by the Crown.  What if an accused's mental condition is such
that it operates to negate mens rea in the particular case?  The example
set out above, in which a person consciously and voluntarily chops off the
victim's head, but believes, because of his mental condition, that he is
chopping a loaf of bread in half, illustrates that evidence of insanity could
go to negate mens rea in a particular case.  In such a
case, if the accused were to raise evidence of his mental condition (thereby
putting his mental capacity in issue), the trial judge would be entitled to
charge the jury on s. 16 .  In these circumstances, it is only when the
trier of fact has rejected the defence of insanity that it may consider the
evidence of his mental condition solely with respect to mens rea; this,
in turn, has only been allowed in cases where an accused is seeking to deny
either the element of planning and deliberation or the specific intent for
murder, and to instead be found guilty of a lesser, included offence (i.e.,
second degree murder or manslaughter).  Thus, it is not true that evidence of
insanity can be raised by an accused simply to deny mens rea for an
offence independent of the insanity defence.

 

    Accordingly,
it is not correct, in my respectful view, to state that the issue of insanity
arises only after both actus reus and mens rea have
been proved by the Crown.  If the accused's insanity puts the existence of mens rea for the
particular offence into question, it cannot be said that mens rea has
been proved by the Crown before the issue of insanity arises.  The Crown
cannot be said to have proved anything beyond a reasonable doubt until
the end of the trial.  Evidence raised by the accused may well give rise to a
reasonable doubt about the existence of an essential element, despite the fact
that the Crown has raised enough evidence such that a no‑evidence motion
would fail.

 

    Thus,
I cannot agree that ""the insanity plea is raised only when mens rea
has been established"" (emphasis added).  In cases where a claim of
insanity is manifested as a denial of the requisite mens rea, it
cannot be said that mens rea has been established until after
the insanity claim has been raised and has failed.

 

    The
second problem with this argument is that even if it were true that the
insanity plea is raised only when mens rea has been
established, it does not mean that a conviction following a failed insanity
claim arises because the Crown has proved the essential elements of the offence
and not because the accused could not discharge the burden to prove his
or her insanity.  Such an argument assumes that the only necessary ingredients
for guilt are the proof of actus reus and mens rea. 
However, this is not true even if s. 16  is ignored for the time being.  If
evidence is raised in the course of a trial for murder that the accused may
have been acting in self‑defence, the Crown must disprove the existence
of the self‑defence justification beyond a reasonable doubt in order for
a conviction to follow.  If the Crown is able to sufficiently negate the claim
of self‑defence, it cannot be said that the resulting conviction follows
from the proof of actus reus and mens rea and not
from the failed self-defence claim.  Thus, it could not be said that a reverse
onus clause on self-defence would not intrude on s. 11(d); yet
such a conclusion would logically follow from the argument put forward by the
Attorney General for New Brunswick and others.

 

    The
above reasoning also applies to the defence of insanity.  Section 16  makes
clear that sanity is essential for guilt (that is, it is essential for
guilt that an accused not fall within the definition of insanity in
s. 16 ).  If a person was insane at the time the offence was committed, he
or she shall not be convicted.  Thus, even if the Crown has proved actus reus and mens rea, if a
plea of insanity is raised and fails because the accused cannot discharge the
presumption of sanity, guilt must follow from the presumption of sanity
and not merely from proof of the ""essential elements"".  The practical
implications of this last point will be discussed in greater detail below.

 

    While
it is helpful to consider the nature of a claim arising under the insanity
provisions in order to gain perspective on the issues in this case, the
question arises whether a conclusion on this issue is determinative in the
s. 11(d) analysis.

 

    Does
the Nature of s. 16  Determine the Charter  Issue?

 

    The
Crown has argued that sanity is not an essential element of an offence (as is mens rea) and,
therefore, does not engage the presumption of innocence.

 

    The
Crown takes the position that insanity raises a question of mental capacity,
which is not the same as denying mens rea in a particular
case.  The insanity defence denies that the accused is a ""moral
agent"" and asserts that he or she should therefore be exempt from
liability under the criminal law.  This position largely accords with the
foregoing analysis of the insanity defence as a denial of criminal capacity. 
However, I am not satisfied that this characterization of the insanity
provisions necessarily leads to the conclusion that the presumption of
innocence is not violated by the presumption of sanity.

 

    The
Crown argues that insanity does not ""disprove"" an offence (nor, I
assume, an essential element of an offence) and that the presumption of
innocence is therefore inapplicable to s. 16 .  The Crown relies on the
judgment of McIntyre J. in R. v. Holmes, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 914,
to the effect that if a statute requires the accused to prove a defence on a
balance of probabilities where the Crown has already proved the offence beyond
reasonable doubt there is no violation of s. 11(d). 
Implicit in this argument is the assumption that the insanity provisions
provide an exemption for an accused who, but for his insanity, would be found
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  This may or may not be true, depending on
the way in which the claim of insanity is raised ‑- as can be seen from
the examples set out above.  The Crown submits that the insanity claim is a
means of escaping criminal liability ""above and beyond"" the
presumption of innocence which applies in respect of the specific offence.  The
Crown is essentially arguing that the presumption of innocence only operates
with respect to essential elements of the offence and with respect to common‑law
defences.  A claim of insanity under s. 16  raises a claim for an exemption
to criminal liability; it neither negates an essential element of the offence
nor raises a common law defence (justification or excuse).  Therefore, the
requirement embodied in s. 16(4) that the accused prove insanity on a
balance of probabilities does not violate the presumption of innocence.

 

    In
my view, this argument does not accord with the principles enunciated by this
Court in R. v. Whyte, [1988] 2
S.C.R. 3.  In Whyte, the constitutionality of
s. 237(1)(a) of the Code was in issue. 
Section 237(1)(a) raised a presumption of care or control of an
automobile upon a finding of occupancy of the driver's seat, with respect to
the offence of impaired driving.  Dickson C.J. stated (at p. 18):

 

The real concern is not whether the accused must
disprove an element or prove an excuse, but that an accused may be convicted
while a reasonable doubt exists.  When that possibility exists, there is a
breach of the presumption of innocence.

 

    The
exact characterization of a factor as an essential element, a collateral
factor, an excuse, or a defence should not affect the analysis of the
presumption of innocence.  It is the final effect of a provision on the
verdict that is decisive.  If an accused is required to prove some fact on the
balance of probabilities to avoid conviction, the provision violates the
presumption of innocence because it permits a conviction in spite of a
reasonable doubt in the mind of the trier of fact as to the guilt of the
accused.  The trial of an accused in a criminal matter cannot be divided
neatly into stages, with the onus of proof on the accused at an intermediate
stage and the ultimate onus on the Crown.  Section 237(1)(a)
requires the accused to prove lack of intent on a balance of probabilities.  If
an accused does not meet this requirement the trier of fact is required by law
to accept that the accused had care or control and to convict.  But of course
it does not follow that the trier of fact is convinced beyond a reasonable
doubt that the accused had care or control of the vehicle.  [Emphasis added.]

 

In my
view, the principles enunciated in Whyte are applicable to
this case and establish that the presumption of sanity embodied in
s. 16(4) violates the presumption of innocence.  If an accused is found to
have been insane at the time of the offence, he will not be found
guilty; thus the ""fact"" of insanity precludes a verdict of guilty. 
Whether the claim of insanity is characterized as a denial of mens rea, an excusing
defence or, more generally, as an exemption based on criminal incapacity, the
fact remains that sanity is essential for guilt.  Section 16(4) allows a factor
which is essential for guilt to be presumed, rather than proven by the
Crown beyond a reasonable doubt.  Moreover, it requires an accused to disprove
sanity (or prove insanity) on a balance of probabilities; it therefore violates
the presumption of innocence because it permits a conviction in spite of a
reasonable doubt in the mind of the trier of fact as to the guilt of the
accused.

 

    Before
leaving this point, let us examine the recent decision of this Court in R. v.
Schwartz, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 443.  In Schwartz, this
Court held that s. 106.7(1) of the Code, which
required an accused to prove that he had a firearms acquisition certificate in
order to avoid a conviction for the offence of possession of a restricted
weapon for which the possessor has no registration certificate, did not violate
s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  The Crown has
relied on the majority reasons of McIntyre J. to support its argument that
s. 16(4)  does not violate the presumption of innocence because it sets up
an exemption rather than a defence.

 

    In
my view, the reasons of McIntyre J. in Schwartz
indicate that the principles enunciated by this Court in Whyte were
not operative in that case.  The result in Schwartz stemmed
from a finding, based on the particular facts of the case, which could not have
been made in Whyte; thus, the decision in Schwartz in no
way overrules the decision in Whyte.  In Schwartz,
McIntyre J. set out the ratio of Whyte, and stated (at
p. 485):

 

    In
my view, however, these principles cannot be of assistance to the appellant
here.  There is no reverse onus imposed upon the accused by s. 106.7(1),
despite the words which are employed in the section.  The holder of a
registration certificate cannot be made subject to a conviction under
s. 89(1).  He is not required to prove or disprove any element of the
offence or for that matter anything related to the offence.

 

Subsequent
statements of McIntyre J. indicate that the conclusion that s. 106.7(1)
imposed no reverse onus was based on the finding that, because of the
particular factual nature of the offence, it could not be said that an accused
who was unable to establish that he was the holder of a registration
certificate could be convicted under s. 89(1) despite the existence of
a reasonable doubt on that issue.  In other words, the majority's view was
that production or non‑production of the registration certificate was
conclusive of whether the accused had a registration certificate.

 

    Conversely,
in Whyte, this Court held that proof that an accused occupied
the driver's seat of a motor vehicle was not determinative of whether
the accused had care and control of the vehicle.  Therefore, the statutory
presumption contained in s. 237(1)(a) of the Code was
such that an accused could be convicted in spite of a reasonable doubt
in the mind of the trier of fact as to his guilt.  Consequently,
s. 237(1)(a) was found to violate the presumption of innocence.

 

    Accordingly,
the principles enunciated in Whyte remain intact and are applicable to
this case, unless this case falls within the narrow ratio of Schwartz.   In
my view, this case does not fall within the ratio of Schwartz.  The
presumption of sanity embodied in s. 16(4) operates differently than do
the statutory presumptions which were at issue in Whyte and Schwartz.  The
presumption of sanity is not an inference drawn from the existence or
proof of an underlying fact (such as being unable to produce a registration
certificate for a restricted weapon, or being found in the driver's seat of a
motor vehicle).  Rather, sanity is something which is assumed from the
outset (see Charles, Cromwell and Jobson, Evidence and the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1989), at pp. 130‑31). 
Thus, in enacting s. 16(4), Parliament has not designated any basic
""fact"" which, when established, removes all possibility of reasonable
doubt as to lack of insanity (and therefore removes all reasonable doubt as to
guilt).  Parliament has simply reversed the onus on a factor which is essential
for guilt.  If an accused cannot discharge the persuasive burden with respect
to his insanity, the trier of fact may well be obliged to convict the accused
despite the existence of a reasonable doubt as to sanity, and therefore, as to
guilt.

 

    A
number of parties have raised the argument that a successful claim of insanity
under s. 16  does not result in a finding of ""innocence"" and in
the accused going free, but rather results in a special verdict and in the
accused being detained in a psychiatric institution under a warrant of the
Lieutenant Governor via s. 614(2)  (formerly s. 542(2)) (the
""L.G.W. system"").  Because the result of a s. 16  claim is
not a ""true acquittal"", the argument is made that the presumption of
innocence is inapplicable.

 

    The
Attorney General for New Brunswick has made this argument as has the Attorney
General of Quebec and the Attorney General for Alberta.  The Attorney General
for Alberta argues that a finding of insanity under s. 16  is neither a
determination of guilt nor innocence, but rather is a qualification of a
""not guilty"" verdict.  The Attorney General for Alberta notes that an
accused who is found to be insane is put into the ""treatment phase""
of the Code rather than the ""punishment phase"" and argues
that because a verdict of ""not guilty by reason of insanity"" is
""clearly not a full acquittal in the traditional sense"", it is
necessary for an accused to prove his insanity so that a ""positive
finding"" will underlie the special detention.  The Attorney General for
Alberta argues that the burden of proof embodied in s. 16(4) does not
operate so as to leave a reasonable doubt remaining as to ""innocence"". 
He states ""section 16(4) does not raise issue [sic] that
the accused may be convicted despite a reasonable doubt that his actions were
lawful"".

 

    This
argument seems to amount to a claim that the detention under the
""L.G.W. system"", which follows from a finding of ""not
guilty by reason of insanity"", is a result which an accused who raises
s. 16  is positively seeking.  In other words, an accused who is asking for
the ""benefit"" of a finding of insanity properly bears the burden of
proving that he falls within the criteria for special detention.   In my view,
this argument misses the essential point.  An accused who raises s. 16  is
raising it in order to avoid being convicted of a criminal offence.  He
is negating criminal culpability, on the basis of his mental condition, and is
not necessarily ""seeking"" the special detention.  The special
detention is something which the criminal law imposes upon him for
various policy reasons.  It is incorrect to say that the accused is choosing
special detention; he is seeking to negate his criminal culpability and the
result of doing that (over which the accused has no control) is that he is
subjected to the ""L.G.W. system"".

 

    The
Attorney General for Alberta has stated that a finding of ""not guilty by
reason of insanity"" is not a finding as to ""innocence"".  In my
view, an accused raising insanity is asserting that he is incapable of having
criminal intent and is, therefore, not criminally culpable ‑- this is why
the verdict under s. 16 is ""not guilty by reason of
insanity"".  The accused is alleging that he is
""innocent"" vis‑à‑vis criminal
culpability; he is alleging that he is not criminally
responsible.  Under s. 16, the criminal law may well be determining
what sort of response is appropriate in the circumstances (as the Attorney
General for Alberta has argued), but surely we are, in the process, determining
that the response of attaching criminal culpability is not appropriate. 
In this sense, an accused raising s. 16 is, indeed, seeking a ""true
acquittal"" vis‑à‑vis the attachment of
criminal culpability and is, therefore, entitled to the presumption of
innocence guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter . 

 

    Finally,
a number of parties have argued that s. 16(4) does not violate the Charter  because
the presumption of sanity is necessary to protect the accused when the Crown
raises the issue of insanity.  The appellants have argued that such reasoning
erroneously assumes that the burden of proof for insanity must necessarily be
the same no matter who raises s. 16 .  Assuming, without deciding, that the
Crown may constitutionally raise the issue of insanity, I agree with the
appellant Chaulk that there is no reason why the burden of proof on the accused
and on the Crown must necessarily be the same.  The argument put forward
by the Crown, along with other interveners, is valid only if such an assumption
is made.

 

    In
summary, I find that the presumption of sanity embodied in s. 16(4) of the Code limits
the presumption of innocence guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  I
turn now to a consideration of whether s. 16(4)  can nonetheless be
justified as a reasonable limit under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

Is
s. 16(4) a reasonable limit under s. 1 of the Charter?

 

    There
is no question that the presumption of innocence, guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter , is a
fundamental legal right which plays a very important role in our criminal
justice system.  It has been referred to as ""the golden thread"" of
English criminal law (Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935]
A.C. 462 (H.L.), at pp. 481‑82).  However, like the other
rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter , it is
subject to limitations under s. 1  of the Charter .  The
procedure to be followed when the state is attempting to justify a limit on a
right or freedom under s. 1  was set out by this Court in Oakes, supra:

 

1.  The objective of the impugned provision must be of
sufficient importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right
or freedom; it must relate to concerns which are pressing and substantial in a
free and democratic society before it can be characterized as sufficiently
important.

 

2.  Assuming that a sufficiently important objective has
been established, the means chosen to achieve the objective must pass a
proportionality test; that is to say they must:

 

(a)  be ""rationally connected"" to the
objective and not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations;

 

(b)  impair the right or freedom in question as
""little as possible""; and

 

(c)  be such that their effects on the limitation of
rights and freedoms are proportional to the objective.

 

    Objective

 

    The
parties have put forward several suggestions as to the characterization of the
objective of s. 16(4).  The Attorney General for New Brunswick argues that
the presumption of sanity embodied in s. 16(4) ensures that blame or
responsibility is not placed on individuals who are not aware of or do not appreciate
the nature of the acts that they have carried out, and provides the means by
which insane individuals can be treated, rather than punished.  ""The
insanity provisions also provide a shield to enable the individual to avoid the
stigma attached to criminal conviction"".  The Attorney General for Ontario
makes a similar argument, stating that the presumption of sanity plays an
integral part in recognizing the distinction between those accused persons with
a blameworthy state of mind and those individuals who, due to a condition of
mental disorder, are in need of treatment.

 

    In
my opinion, with respect for contrary views, these characterizations of the
objective miss the point.  The factors cited by these parties are more
connected to the objectives of s. 16(1) than to s. 16(4).  In
enacting s. 16(1), Parliament has made a law that no person shall be
convicted of an offence committed while that person was insane; the objective
of this law is to avoid stigmatizing and punishing, as criminals, people who are
""sick"" as opposed to ""bad"".  In enacting s. 16(4),
Parliament has made a law that any accused who alleges that he was insane at
the time of the offence must prove his insanity on a balance of
probabilities.  Section 16(4) was not enacted to further the objective of
s. 16(1); if anything, the onus imposed by s. 16(4) means that some
""sick"" people will be incorrectly stigmatized and punished as
""bad"" and, therefore, s. 16(4) actually hinders the objective
cited by the Attorneys General for New Brunswick and Ontario. 

 

    Before
characterizing the relevant objective, I feel that it is necessary to focus on
what it is about s. 16(4) which violates s. 11 (d).  The
problem with s. 16(4) is two‑fold.  First, the provision allows
sanity (something which is essential to guilt) to be presumed.  This
violates the basic principle (set out in Oakes) that
the state bears the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Second,
the provision requires an accused to prove his or her insanity, on a
balance of probabilities, in order to rebut the presumption of sanity.  This
gives rise to a reversal of the burden of proof such that an accused could be
found guilty of a criminal offence despite a reasonable doubt in the mind of
the trier of fact about the accused's insanity.

 

    It
is therefore necessary to focus on the presumption and on the reversal of the
burden of proof and ask:  what was Parliament's specific objective in forcing
an accused who raises s. 16 to prove his or her insanity on a balance of
probabilities?  The answer can only be that Parliament wished to avoid placing
on the Crown the impossibly onerous burden of disproving insanity and to
thereby secure the conviction of the guilty (who are not ""sick"") by
defeating acquittals based on a doubt as regards insanity.  Drawing an analogy
to my (dissenting) reasons in Schwartz, supra,
s. 16(4) is no more ""particular or essential"" to insanity
legislation than s. 106.7(1) is to weapons legislation.  Section 16(4) is
a purely evidentiary section whose objective is to relieve the prosecution of
the tremendous difficulty of proving an accused's sanity in order to secure a
conviction.

 

    The
above characterization of the objective of s. 16(4) becomes clearer if one
considers what would be the case if society's knowledge of the brain and of the
nature of mental illness was suddenly and enormously expanded.  What if our
state of knowledge and technology was such that a doctor could perform a simple
test to conclusively determine whether a person was insane within the meaning
of s. 16 at the time of the offence?  If this were the case, s. 16(4)
would not be justified (and would not pass even the first branch of the Oakes test). 
All that would be necessary would be a provision requiring an accused alleging
insanity to submit to this test.  The Crown would have the full burden of
disproving insanity beyond a reasonable doubt in any case where insanity was
raised by an accused.  Note, however, that the remaining provisions in
s. 16 (or very similar provisions) would still be necessary and desireable. 
The objective of avoiding the stigmatization and punishment of an individual
under the criminal law and of maintaining the distinction between
""bad"" and ""sick"" offenders would still exist and would
continue to be met by s. 16(1).  If the objective of s. 16(4) is as
stated by the Attorneys General for New Brunswick and Ontario, the section
would prevail whatever society's state of knowledge.  The fact that it would
disappear if it became reasonably possible for the Crown to meet a claim of insanity
illustrates that the essential objective of s. 16(4) is to relieve the
Crown of the nearly impossible task of disproving insanity whenever it is
raised.

 

    Many
of the parties have identified the potential difficulties faced by the Crown in
proving sanity.  The Attorney General for New Brunswick states that without the
cooperation of the accused, evidence of mental illness would be virtually
impossible for the prosecution to obtain.  If the burden were on the Crown,
there would be no way to ensure such cooperation.  The Attorney General of
Manitoba has described, in some detail, the impracticality of requiring the
Crown to prove sanity.  The Code provides no method of forcing an
accused to submit to psychiatric examinations unless fitness to stand trial is
in issue.  The Attorney General of Canada has described, in detail, the
difficulties involved in obtaining a conclusive psychiatric opinion as to an
accused's sanity, and characterizes the objective of s. 16(4) as ""to
allocate the burden of proof on the issue of insanity in a workable
fashion"".  A further difficulty arises because the Crown would be required
to prove sanity not as of the time of trial, but as of the time of the
offence.  Given that the Crown will often not know that insanity is going
to be raised until some time after the offence takes place, the
difficulties mentioned above are compounded.

 

    Accordingly,
the objective of s. 16(4) is to avoid placing an impossible burden of
proof on the Crown and to thereby secure the conviction of the guilty.  In my
view, this objective is sufficiently important to warrant limiting
constitutionally protected rights and s. 16(4) passes the first branch of
the Oakes test.

 

    Proportionality
Test

 

    1.  Rational
Connection

 

    The
question to be addressed at this stage of the Oakes
analysis is whether there is a rational connection between the objective, which
was identified above under the first branch of the test, and the means which
have been chosen to attain this objective ‑- namely, the reverse onus
provision embodied in s. 16(4).

 

    In
my view, many of the parties have misdirected their arguments on this portion
of the Oakes test.  The Crown has correctly formulated the rational
connection test, but because it adopted the wrong objective for s. 16(4),
it has, in my view, applied the test incorrectly to the facts of this case. 
The Crown correctly stated the rational connection test as follows:

 

Unlike Oakes and Whyte,
supra, this is not a case of a presumption based on a proved
fact.  The presumption of sanity applies without proof of basic fact, and
applies until the contrary is proved.

 

    Given
this distinction, the ""rational connection"" in the present case must
be drawn directly between the objective and the measures employed.

 

    If
the Crown's formulation of the rational connection test is employed using the
objective suggested above (i.e., to avoid placing a next to impossible burden
on the Crown), the result is that s. 16(4) passes the rational connection
test.  Placing a burden on an accused who raises s. 16 to prove his or her
insanity on a balance of probabilities certainly furthers the objective of not
putting a burden on the Crown which is virtually impossible to meet.  Thus, the
presumption of sanity and the reverse onus embodied in s. 16(4) are
rationally connected to the objective.

 

    Therefore,
it is necessary to turn to the next part of the proportionality branch of the Oakes test: 
does s. 16(4) impair s. 11 (d)
""as little as possible""?

 

    2.  As Little
as Possible

 

    The
Attorneys General for New Brunswick, Ontario, and Quebec, argue that
s. 16(4) impairs the presumption of innocence as little as possible
because the persuasive burden is placed on an accused only after the
Crown has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, both actus reus and mens rea.  While
the Crown is discharging its initial burden, an accused has the full benefit of
s. 11 (d).

 

    As
stated above, it is not necessarily true that the accused's burden under
s. 16 arises only after the Crown has proved both actus reus and mens rea beyond
a reasonable doubt.  While this will sometimes be the case, insanity will often
be manifested as a denial of actus reus or mens rea. 
Accordingly, I am not convinced by this argument that s. 16(4) impairs the
presumption of innocence as little as possible.

 

    Numerous
other arguments were made under this branch of the proportionality test (i.e.,
that the reverse onus will not arise very often, that the burden placed on the
accused is ""not a heavy onus"", etc.).  I am not persuaded by any of
these arguments.  In my view, the question to be addressed at this stage of the
s. 1  inquiry is whether Parliament could reasonably have chosen an
alternative means which would have achieved the identified objective as
effectively.

 

    Recent
judgments of this Court (R. v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd., [1986]
2 S.C.R. 713; Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1989]
1 S.C.R. 927; and Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the
Criminal Code (Man.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123) indicate that Parliament is not
required to search out and to adopt the absolutely least intrusive means of
attaining its objective.  Furthermore, when assessing the alternative means
which were available to Parliament, it is important to consider whether a less
intrusive means would achieve the ""same"" objective or would achieve
the same objective as effectively.

 

    The
appellants have argued that s. 16(4) does not impair the
presumption of innocence as little as possible because the objective of the
provision could be obtained in a manner which is less intrusive on Charter 
rights.  For example, Parliament could have enacted a provision which merely
requires an accused alleging insanity to meet an evidentiary burden (i.e.,
raise a reasonable doubt), at which point the burden would shift to the Crown
to disprove insanity (or prove sanity) beyond a reasonable doubt. A number of
parties have countered this argument with the contention that placing an
evidentiary burden on the accused would not be sufficient to achieve the
objective.  In other words, s. 16(4)  impairs s. 11 (d) rights
as little as possible because any less intrusive means would not achieve the
""same"" objective or would not achieve the same objective as
effectively.

 

    The
Attorneys General of Quebec and Ontario both argue that an evidentiary burden
would be ineffective because it is very easy for an accused to ""fake""
insanity and to raise a reasonable doubt.  Thus, lowering the burden on the
accused to a mere evidentiary burden would defeat the very purpose of the
presumption of sanity.  The appellants answer that only an accused who is
willing to be incarcerated under the ""L.G.W. system"" will be
inclined to raise insanity.  Given the severe loss of liberty which corresponds
to a successful insanity plea, it is unlikely that accused people will raise
s. 16 on a routine basis.

 

    It
is true that s. 16 will be seldom raised, given the substantial constraint
on liberty which follows a successful insanity plea.  Nonetheless, I have concluded
that the objective of the current provision is ""pressing and
substantial"", given the next to impossible burden which would be placed on
the Crown if s. 16(4) did not exist.  If insanity were easier for an
accused to establish, the defence would be successfully invoked more
often (even if, statistically, it is still infrequently raised).  Thus, putting
a lesser burden on the accused would not have achieved the objective
which is achieved by s. 16(4).

 

    It
is, of course, possible to imagine some combination of insanity provisions
which might achieve the identified objective and which would violate
s. 11 (d) to a lesser extent then does the extant provision. 
For example, Parliament could have enacted a provision which provided that when
an accused raises insanity, he is required to raise a reasonable doubt as to
his sanity in order to shift the burden to the Crown to disprove insanity
(prove sanity) on a balance of probabilities.   The provision could also state
that if an accused wishes to raise insanity he must submit to psychiatric
examinations at the request of the Crown.  These hypothetical provisions would
also have to address the problem of obtaining evidence regarding insanity as of
the time of the offence.  Whether such a combination of insanity provisions
would achieve the identified objective as effectively as does s. 16(4) is,
of course, a matter of speculation.  It is impossible to know what the effects
of this alternative would be until it is put into practice.

 

    Some
of the parties have argued that any alternative to s. 16(4) which would
meet the identified objective could very well bring about violations of other Charter 
rights.  For example, the Charter  might be invoked by an individual who
was incarcerated under the ""L.G.W. system"" when only a reasonable
doubt existed as to his or her insanity.  Some of the parties have also
suggested that putting a greater burden on the Crown could lead to violations
of s. 8  during the process of gathering evidence.  While these arguments are
necessarily speculative, they do point out the difficulty faced by Parliament
in choosing among the alternative means to meet its ""pressing and
substantial"" objective.  As was stated in Reference re
ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), supra, it is
not the role of this Court to second‑guess the wisdom of policy choices
made by Parliament.  In enacting s. 16(4), Parliament may not have chosen
the absolutely least intrusive means of meeting its objective, but it
has chosen from a range of means which impair s. 11 (d) as
little as is reasonably possible.   Within this range of means it is virtually
impossible to know, let alone be sure, which means violate Charter  rights
the least.

 

    In
summary, I conclude that s. 16(4) violates s. 11 (d) as
little as possible in achieving its objective.  It is therefore necessary to
address the last part of the proportionality test:  are the detrimental effects
of s. 16(4) on the presumption of innocence proportional to the objective?

 

    3. 
Proportionality Between Effects and Objective

 

    The
presumption of sanity and the reversal of onus embodied in s. 16(4) exist
in order to avoid placing a virtually impossible burden on the Crown.  The
burden on the accused is not the full criminal burden; rather, the accused is
required to prove his or her insanity on a balance of probabilities.  If an
accused were able to rebut the presumption merely by raising a reasonable doubt
as to his or her insanity, the very purpose of the presumption of sanity would
be defeated and the objective would not be achieved.  Any other means of
achieving the objective could also give rise to violations of other Charter  rights.

 

    Section
16(4) represents an accommodation of three important societal interests: 
avoiding a virtually impossible burden on the Crown; convicting the guilty; and
acquitting those who truly lack the capacity for criminal intent.  The result
of this compromise is that some guilty people will be acquitted and will be
dealt with via the ""L.G.W. system"", and some insane (and
therefore not guilty) people will be convicted and will be stigmatized and
punished as criminals.  Of course, this would still be the case if the burden
on the accused were lowered so as to require him or her to raise a reasonable
doubt as to insanity; some insane accused may be unable even to raise a
reasonable doubt as to insanity.  This result is the inevitable consequence of
the uncertainty of our scientific knowledge and of our commitment (as expressed
in s. 11 (d)) not to convict those who were insane at the time of
the offence.  The alternatives to this compromise raise their own Charter 
problems and give no guarantee as to whether they will achieve the objective. 
As I have mentioned above, the Charter  does not require
Parliament to ""roll the dice"" in its effort to achieve ""pressing
and substantial"" objectives in order to adopt the absolutely least
intrusive legislative provision. 

    While
the effect of s. 16(4) on the presumption of innocence is clearly
detrimental, given the importance of the objective that the Crown not be
encumbered with an unworkable burden and given that I have concluded above that
s. 16(4) limits s. 11 (d) as little as is
reasonably possible, it is my view that there is proportionality between the
effects of the measure and the objective.

 

    Accordingly,
s. 16(4) is a reasonable limit on the presumption of innocence which can
be upheld under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    Having
dealt with the constitutional questions, I turn now to a consideration of the
other issues raised by the appellants.

 

The Meaning
of ""Wrong"" in s. 16(2) 

 

    The
appellants submit that the trial judge erred in his direction to the jury in
stating that the word ""wrong"" as used in s. 16(2)  means
""contrary to the laws of Canada"" and that the Court of Appeal erred
in holding that the trial judge had made no mistake in this regard.  It is
argued that the word ""wrong"" in s. 16(2) of the Code should
be interpreted by this Court to mean ""morally wrong"" and not simply
""legally wrong"".  Section 16(2)  reads as follows:

 

    16. ...

 

    (2)
For the purposes of this section, a person is insane when the person is in a
state of natural imbecility or has disease of the mind to an extent that
renders the person incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an act
or omission or of knowing that an act or omission is wrong.

 

    At
trial, the jury was asked to consider whether the appellants were not guilty by
reason of insanity under both branches of the test in s. 16(2) .  The jury
rejected the plea of insanity and the appellants were convicted of first degree
murder.  The question of the correct interpretation and application of the
first branch of the test for insanity in s. 16(2) , namely, whether the
appellants were capable of appreciating the nature and quality of the act
committed, is not before this Court.  However, the correct interpretation of
the second branch of the test, that is, whether the appellants were capable of
knowing that their act was wrong, is directly in issue in this appeal.

 

    In
his directions to the jury, Ferg J. clearly stated the meaning that was to
be given to the term ""wrong"" for the purposes of s. 16(2) .  He
directed:

 

    Next as an alternative even if the accused did
appreciate the nature and quality of what he was doing and it's for you to
decide, as I've said, is also insanity if the accused was laboring under a
disease of the mind that rendered him incapable of knowing that his act was
wrong. [sic] By wrong I mean that it was a criminal act or legally
wrong.

 

    Again,
if you are satisfied on the balance of probabilities that either accused was
incapable of knowing that his act was legally wrong because of a disease of the
mind from which he was suffering, you will find him not guilty by reason of
insanity.

 

After
deliberating for some time, the jury asked the trial judge the following
question:

 

Re:  Knowledge of the laws of Canada:

 

(a) does this refer to simple knowledge of the rules as
evidenced by recognition of the consequences, i.e.:  police and jail term or;

 

(b) does
it refer to their awareness of whether the laws apply to them at the time of
the murder . . . 

 

Ferg J.
answered their question by repeating substantially what he had stated in his
original direction.  He summarized:

 

    This
part is the alternative, the second part, and this has to do with knowledge
capable of knowing his act was wrong. As an alternative even if the accused did
‑‑ if you find that it's for you to decide ‑‑ did
appreciate the nature and quality of what he was doing, and it's for you to
decide as I just said, it is also insanity if the accused was laboring under a
disease of the mind that rendered him incapable of knowing that his act was
wrong and by the word wrong I mean that it was a criminal act or illegally
wrong, if you will, the laws of Canada. [sic]

 

    The
Court of Appeal found no error on the part of the trial judge in directing the
jury, stating that it was clear that the appellants ""knew and fully
appreciated the nature and consequences of their acts and they knew that what
they were doing was legally wrong"".

 

    As
noted above, the appellants submit that the term ""wrong"" for the
purposes of s. 16(2) of the Code should be
interpreted to mean ""morally"" wrong and not ""legally""
wrong.  The respondent made no submission with respect to this issue in its
factum, but argued orally that, regardless of the meaning that is to be given
to the word ""wrong"" in this case, the difference between morally
wrong and legally wrong where a very serious offence such as murder is involved
""is so narrow as to be hardly worth the effort of deciding between
them.""  It was further argued in oral pleadings that the meaning of
""wrong"" in s. 16(2) , having its source in the seminal judgment
of the House of Lords in M'Naghten's Case (1843), 10
Cl. & Fin. 200, 8 E.R. 718, incorporates not only a moral
but also a legal dimension in such a way that the two cannot be divorced, with
the result that a person who knows that an act is legally wrong must also
comprehend that the act is morally wrong.

 

    The
meaning of the term ""wrong"" for the purposes of s. 16(2)  was
determined by this Court in Schwartz v. The Queen, [1977] 1
S.C.R. 673.  Speaking for the majority, Martland J. held that the capacity
to know that an act is wrong in this context means no more than the capacity to
know that what one is doing is against the law of the land.

 

    The
majority reviewed the principles enunciated in M'Naghten's Case and
considered their subsequent application by the Court of Criminal Appeal in
England and by the High Court of Australia. In M'Naghten's Case, Lord
Tindal C.J. stated (at pp. 722‑23):

 

. . . to establish a defence on the ground of
insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the
act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from
disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was
doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was
wrong.

 

                                                                        . . .

 

If the
question were to be put as to the knowledge of the accused solely and
exclusively with reference to the law of the land, it might tend to confound
the jury, by inducing them to believe that an actual knowledge of the law of
the land was essential in order to lead to a conviction; whereas the law is
administered upon the principle that every one must be taken conclusively to
know it, without proof that he does know it. If the accused was conscious
that the act was one which he ought not to do, and if that act was at the same
time contrary to the law of the land, he is punishable; and the usual course
therefore has been to leave the question to the jury, whether the party accused
had a sufficient degree of reason to know that he was doing an act that was
wrong:  and this course we think is correct, accompanied with such
observations and explanations as the circumstances of each particular case may
require.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    The
majority continued by considering the application of the M'Naghten rules by
the Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v. Codere (1916), 12
Cr. App. R. 21, and R. v. Windle, [1952] 2
Q.B. 826.  In Codere, Lord Reading C.J. held (at pp.
27-28):

 

It is conceded now that the standard to be applied is
whether according to the ordinary standard adopted by reasonable men the act
was right or wrong. There may be cases where it is difficult to decide that
question, but that is not the case here.

 

                                                                        . . .

 

That is the accepted test, and applying it in this case
there can be no room for doubt; once it is clear that the appellant knew that
the act was wrong in law, then he was doing an act which he was conscious he
ought not to do, and as it was against the law, it was punishable by law;
assuming, therefore, that he knew the nature and quality of the act, he was
guilty of murder, and was properly convicted.

 

    The
difficulty no doubt arises over the words ""conscious that the act was one
which he ought not to do,"" but, looking at all the answers in
M'Naghten's case, it seems that if it is punishable by law it is an
act which he ought not to do, and that is the meaning in which the phrase is
used in that case.

 

    In Windle, Lord
Goddard C.J. stated clearly that the word ""wrong"" as used in the M'Naghten rules
meant ""legally wrong"" (at p. 833):

 

    Courts
of law can only distinguish between that which is in accordance with law and
that which is contrary to law....  The law cannot embark on the question, and
it would be an unfortunate thing if it were left to juries to consider whether
some particular act was morally right or wrong. The test must be whether it is
contrary to law.

 

    Lastly,
the majority in Schwartz considered the judgment of the High
Court of Australia in Stapleton v. The Queen (1952), 86
C.L.R. 358.  In Stapleton, the High Court refused to apply Windle. 
Instead, citing directions that Dixon C.J. had given to a jury as a trial
judge, the High Court held that the capacity of the accused to make moral
judgments must be examined and that ""wrong"" was not to be defined
narrowly as a legal wrong (at p. 367):

 

The
question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular
act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this
sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of
the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people
make that act right or wrong?  If through the disordered condition of the mind
he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and
composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was
wrong.

 

    The
majority in Schwartz rejected the application of the M'Naghten rules
in Stapleton in favour of the decision of the Court of Criminal
Appeal in Codere.  In their view, the effect of
s. 16(2)  is to make the defence of insanity available to an accused who,
because he suffered from a disease of the mind, did not know that he was
committing a crime. The majority did not believe that the test adopted by the
High Court of Australia in Stapleton differed from the ""legally
wrong"" test since, ""according to the ordinary principles of
reasonable men, it is wrong to commit a crime"" (p. 701).  Even if
there was a difference between the two tests, they could not accept that an
insane person, committing an act that he knows to be a crime, could be
acquitted if he believed that the act was acceptable according to the standards
of reasonable men when a sane person believing such would not be acquitted. 
Furthermore, the majority rejected the test adopted in Stapleton on the
ground that it entailed a subjective approach by examining the individual
capacity of an accused to reason as to the wrongfulness of an act (at
pp. 701‑2):

 

In my
opinion the test provided in s. 16(2)  is not as to whether the accused, by
reason of mental disease, could or could not calmly consider whether or not the
crime which he committed was morally wrong. He is not to be considered as
insane within s. 16(2)  if he knew what he was doing and also knew that he
was committing a criminal act.

 

    Dickson
J., as he then was, dissented in Schwartz.  He noted that
the word ""wrong"" as used in s. 16(2)  is ambiguous and is capable
of meaning either ""legally"" or ""morally"" wrong. He also
noted that the issue had given rise to conflicting lines of authority in
England, Australia and Canada.

 

    In
order to resolve this question, Dickson J. first examined the internal
structure of the Code in order to determine the meaning that
Parliament intended to give the term.  It would have been internally coherent,
he submitted, for Parliament to use the word ""unlawful"" if it had
intended ""wrong"" to mean ""contrary to law"".  Furthermore,
the use of the word ""mauvais"" in the French
version of s. 16(2)  suggests that Parliament intended the term to have a
meaning broader than merely ""unlawful"".  Lastly, s. 13 formerly
provided that no child between seven and thirteen years of age could be
convicted of a criminal offence ""unless he was competent to know the
nature and consequences of his conduct and to appreciate that it was
wrong""; it would be insupportable, in this context, to equate knowledge
that an act is wrong with the knowledge that the act is contrary to law.

 

    Dickson
J. then considered jurisprudential and doctrinal authorities antedating
M'Naghten's Case and concluded that the historical common law test to
determine the criminal responsibility of insane persons was whether the
particular accused had the capacity to distinguish between conduct that was
good or evil, right or wrong.  M'Naghten's Case, in his
view, did not depart from this standard.  In fact, the case drew a clear line
between knowledge that an act is illegal and knowledge that the act is one that
a person ought not do; this distinction is revealed in the following passage in
M'Naghten's Case (at p. 723):

 

If the
accused was conscious that the act was one which he ought not to do, and if
that act was at the same time contrary to the law of the land, he is
punishable.

 

This passage
indicates clearly that an accused will only be convicted if he commits an act
which he knows he ought not do and which, at the same time, is contrary to
law.  As a result of his interpretation of M'Naghten's Case and the
antecedent common law, Dickson J. concluded that Windle was
decided wrongly and that the judgment in Codere was to
be restricted to the particular facts of the case.  The reasoning in Stapleton was
preferred.

 

    More
fundamentally, Dickson J. concluded that a reading of s. 16(2)  as a whole
leads to the conclusion that ""wrong"" must mean contrary to the
ordinary moral standards of reasonable men and women.  The object of
s. 16(2)  is to protect individuals who do not have the capacity to judge
whether an act is wrong; the inquiry as to the capacity of an accused to reason
must not end simply because it is determined that the accused knew that the act
was a crime.   He argued that this would not serve to protect amoral persons
since any incapacity must result from a disease of the mind (at p. 689):

 

    Section
16(2)  must be read in toto. One looks at capacity to reason and
to reach rational decisions as to whether the act is morally wrong. If wrong
simply means ""illegal"" this virtually forecloses any inquiry as to
capacity. The question for the jury is whether mental illness so obstructed the
thought processes of the accused as to make him incapable of knowing that his
acts were morally wrong. The argument is sometimes advanced that a moral test
favours the amoral offender and that the most favoured will be he who had rid
himself of all moral compunction. This argument overlooks the factor of disease
of the mind. If, as a result of disease of the mind, the offender has lost
completely the ability to make moral distinctions and acts under an insane
delusion, it can well be said that he should not be criminally accountable.

 

The
interpretation of ""wrong"" as meaning ""morally wrong"" would
not, in his opinion, have the effect of opening up the insanity defence to a
far greater number of accused persons.  First, what is illegal and what
breaches society's moral standards do not often differ.  Secondly,
""""[m]oral wrong"" is not to be judged by the personal standards
of the offender but by his awareness that society regards the act as wrong""
(p. 678).  He concluded that an accused is not therefore free, as a result of
such interpretation, to substitute at will his own sense of morality for that
of society, but is to be acquitted by reason of insanity if, by reason of
disease of the mind, he is incapable of knowing that society generally
considers a particular act to be immoral.

 

    With
respect for contrary views, it is my opinion that Schwartz was
wrongly decided by this Court and that the dissenting opinion of Dickson J.
(concurred in by Laskin C.J., Spence and Beetz JJ.) is to be preferred.  The
majority judgment fails, in my respectful view, to appreciate the manner in
which insanity renders our normal principles of criminal responsibility
inapplicable to an individual as well as the particular objectives of
s. 16 of the Code.

 

    I do
not dispute the principle that this Court should not easily overrule its prior
judgments.  In this regard, I refer to the words of Dickson C.J., in which I
concurred, in R. v. Bernard, [1988] 2 S.C.R.
833, at p. 849 (Dickson C.J. was in dissent, although the Justices who
disagreed with his conclusions did not disagree with him on this point):

 

Let me
say immediately that, even if a case were wrongly decided, certainty in the law
remains an important consideration. There must be compelling circumstances to
justify departure from a prior decision. On the other hand, it is clear that
this Court may overrule its own decisions and indeed, it has exercised that
discretion on a number of occasions.

 

    In
my opinion, it is appropriate in this case to overrule the majority decision in Schwartz with
respect to the meaning of ""wrong"" in s. 16(2) .  Dickson C.J.
described in Bernard four separate factors that would
support a decision by this Court to overrule an earlier judgment.  These
factors were not held to be a comprehensive list nor was it claimed that they
must all be present in a particular case to justify overruling a prior
decision.  They are instead guidelines to assist this Court in exercising its
discretion.  The fourth factor that was discussed by Dickson C.J., and that is
directly relevant to the case at bar, is whether the prior judgment in the
context of penal law is unfavourable to an accused in that it expands the scope
of criminal responsibility beyond acceptable limits.  Dickson C.J. stated (at
pp. 860‑61):

 

Respect
for the principle of certainty and the institutional limits imposed upon the
law‑making function of the courts should constrain the Court from
overruling a prior decision where the effect would be to expand criminal
liability. It is not for the courts to create new offences, or to broaden the
net of liability, particularly as changes in the law through judicial decision
operate retrospectively. The same argument does not apply, however, where the
result of overruling a prior decision is to establish a rule favourable to the
accused.

 

In my
view, Schwartz had the effect of expanding the scope of criminal
responsibility unacceptably to include persons who, by reason of disease of the
mind, were incapable of knowing that an act was wrong according to the normal
and reasonable standards of society even though they were aware that the act
was formally a crime.  It is now necessary for this Court to reconsider its
decision in Schwartz in order to redefine the scope of
criminal liability in a manner that will bring it into accordance with the
basic principles of our criminal law.

 

    The
rationale underlying the defence of insanity in Canada, as discussed above
under the rubric ""The Nature of the Insanity Provisions"", rests on
the belief that persons suffering from insanity should not be subject to
standard criminal culpability with its resulting punishment and
stigmatization.  This belief, in turn, flows from the principle that
individuals are held responsible for the commission of criminal offences
because they possess the capacity to distinguish between what is right and what
is wrong.

 

    Section
16(2) of the Code embodies this conception of criminal
responsibility by providing that no person shall be convicted of an offence
who, at the time of committing the act in question, is in a state of
""natural imbecility"" or has disease of the mind to such a degree as
to render him incapable of ""knowing that an act or omission is
wrong.""  The principal issue in this regard is the capacity of the
accused person to know that a particular act or omission is wrong.  As such, to
ask simply what is the meaning of the word ""wrong"" for the purposes
of s. 16(2)  is to frame the question too narrowly.  To paraphrase the
words of the House of Lords in M'Naghten's Case, the
courts must determine in any particular case whether an accused was rendered
incapable, by the fact of his mental disorder, of knowing that the act
committed was one that he ought not have done.

 

    Viewed
from this perspective, it is plain to me that the term ""wrong"" as
used in s. 16(2)  must mean more than simply ""legally wrong"".  In
considering the capacity of a person to know whether an act is one that he
ought or ought not to do, the inquiry cannot terminate with the discovery that
the accused knew that the act was contrary to the formal law.  A person may
well be aware that an act is contrary to law but, by reason of ""natural
imbecility"" or disease of the mind, is at the same time incapable of knowing
that the act is morally wrong in the circumstances according to the moral
standards of society.  This would be the case, for example, if the person
suffered from a disease of the mind to such a degree as to know that it is
legally wrong to kill but, as described by Dickson J. in Schwartz, kills
""in the belief that it is in response to a divine order and therefore not
morally wrong"" (p. 678).

 

    In
applying s. 16(2)  to a particular set of facts, it may be established that
the accused who attempts to invoke the insanity defence is capable of knowing
that he ought not do the act because he knows, first, that the act is contrary
to the formal law or, secondly, that the act breaches the standard of
moral conduct that society expects of its members.  In this regard, subject to
the qualification discussed below, I approve of the interpretation of
s. 16(2)  put forward by Professor Alan Mewett in ""Section 16 and
`Wrong'"" (1976), 18 Crim. L.Q. 413, at
pp. 415‑16:

 

The
question that ought to be asked, it is submitted, is whether the accused,
because of a disease of the mind (first hurdle) was rendered incapable (second
hurdle) of knowing that this act was something that he ought not to do (third
hurdle). If he was capable of knowing that the act was contrary to law and that
he ought not to do an act contrary to law, then the defence should not apply.
If he was incapable of knowing that it was contrary to law, but capable of
knowing that it was an act condemned by people generally, then again the
defence should not apply. But if he was incapable of knowing that the act was
contrary to law and incapable of knowing that it was an act condemned by
people generally, then the defence should apply. This only leaves a situation
where he was capable of knowing that the act was contrary to law but incapable
both of knowing that to act contrary to law was condemned by people generally and of
knowing that this particular act was condemned by people generally. I would
have thought that such an accused (who must be the rarest of all individuals)
is precisely one who ought to be found not guilty by reason of insanity.

 

    The
qualification that I would make of Professor Mewett's comments is that the
insanity defence should not be made unavailable simply on the basis that an
accused knows that a particular act is contrary to law and that he knows,
generally, that he should not commit an act that is a crime. It is possible
that a person may be aware that it is ordinarily wrong to commit a crime but,
by reason of a disease of the mind, believes that it would be ""right""
according to the ordinary morals of his society to commit the crime in a
particular context. In this situation, the accused would be entitled to be
acquitted by reason of insanity.

 

    The
test articulated in s. 16(2)  is directed, as emphasized above, at an
analysis of the capacity of the accused to reason and to understand the meaning
of the terms ""right"" and ""wrong"", concepts that demand a
moral judgment on the part of every individual in order to be applied in
practice.  It cannot be determined that an accused does not have the
necessary capacity to engage in such moral reasoning simply because he or she
does not have the simple ability to retain factual information, for example,
the ability to know that a certain act is a crime in the formal sense.  As
Professor Colvin points out in Principles of Criminal Law, op.
cit., at pp. 253 and 255:

 

    The capacity to know the law in a formal sense
involves typically no more than the capacity to absorb and retain normative
information. . . . For the most part, formal knowledge of law does
not call into play the capacity to analyze and assess an assortment of data
which may present divergent and competing messages.

 

                                                                        . . .

 

Full
normative understanding surely encompasses comprehension of what a rule
violation will mean to other people and how they will respond to it. If a
psychotic person kills, knowing that her action is a crime, but deludedly
believing that it will be lauded by everyone and that the law will not be
enforced against her, then her capacity for normative understanding is so
severely impaired that the attribution of criminal culpability is
inappropriate. It could also be said that she is incapable of knowing that the
act is a moral wrong. It could also be said that she is incapable of knowing
that the act is contextually a legal wrong. Nothing turns on the choice between
these modes of expression. The crucial point is that, although she is capable
of knowing that her act is wrong in a formal sense, she is incapable of knowing
that it is wrong in a contextual sense.

 

Professors
Jacques Fortin and Louise Viau discuss a comparable principle in their Traité de
droit pénal général (1982), at p. 184:

 

[TRANSLATION] Criminal responsibility is based
historically and culturally both on the notion of moral blame and on the rule
that ignorance of the law is no excuse.

 

    It
does not seem right to us to determine capacity using a rule which, by
definition, applies only to those of sound mind.  Capacity is a purely
subjective and personal dimension of the individual, whereas the rule excluding
ignorance of the law is purely utilitarian in nature and allows an accused to
be convicted where he or she commits an offence in ignorance of the legal
prohibition.

pp. 340‑41, and Anne‑Marie Boisvert, ""Psychanalyse d'une
défense:  réflexions sur l'aliénation mentale"" (1990), 69
Can. Bar Rev. 46, at pp. 61‑62.

 

    An
interpretation of s. 16(2)  that makes the defence available to an accused
who knew that he or she was committing a crime but was unable to comprehend
that the act was a moral wrong will not open the floodgates to amoral offenders
or to offenders who relieve themselves of all moral considerations.  First, the
incapacity to make moral judgments must be causally linked to a disease of the
mind; if the presence of a serious mental disorder is not established, criminal
responsibility cannot be avoided. Secondly, as was pointed out by Dickson J. in Schwartz,
supra, """"[m]oral wrong"" is not to be judged by
the personal standards of the offender but by his awareness that society
regards the act as wrong"" (p. 678).  The accused will not benefit
from substituting his own moral code for that of society.  Instead, he
will be protected by s. 16(2)  if he is incapable of understanding that the
act is wrong according to the ordinary moral standards of reasonable members of
society.

 

    In
the case at bar, the trial judge directed the jury that the insanity defence
was not available to the appellants pursuant to the second branch of the test
set out in s. 16(2)  if it reached the conclusion that the appellants knew,
at the time of committing the offence, that the act was contrary to the laws of
Canada.  Of course, he cannot be faulted for having followed the decision of
this Court in Schwartz.  Nevertheless, for the reasons
discussed above, our interpretation of s. 16(2)  in Schwartz was not
correct.  As a result, I would order a new trial.

 

Section 16(3): 
Specific Delusions

 

    The
appellants argue that s. 16(3) of the Code
provides an accused with a defence that is independent of s. 16(2)  and
that they should be entitled to an acquittal under s. 16(3) even if they
fail to meet the conditions set out in s. 16(2) .  Section 16(3) provides
as follows:

 

    16. ...

 

    (3)
A person who has specific delusions, but is in other respects sane, shall not
be acquitted on the ground of insanity unless the delusions caused that person
to believe in the existence of a state of things that, if it existed, would
have justified or excused the act or omission of that person.

 

    Specifically,
they submit that s. 16(3) should be interpreted in the following manner:

 

(1)Specific delusion should be interpreted in accordance
with ordinary language and should mean a non‑ambiguous fixed unshakeable
belief.

 

(2)The words ""in other respects sane"" should
be interpreted to mean ""does not fall within s. 16(2) "".

 

(3)The
final clause of s. 16(3) should be interpreted to give to the accused the
right to raise the common law defences if the accused believed in a state of
things that would at common law give rise to these defences.

 

    The
appellants submit that the trial judge should have clearly instructed the jury
to consider and apply s. 16(3) in accordance with this interpretation. 
They argue that they suffered from specific delusions such that, even if they
did not fall within s. 16(2) , they should have been acquitted under
s. 16(3) on the grounds that they believed in a state of things that, if
true, would have justified or excused their actions.  In their view, while the
trial judge did not exclude the application of s. 16(3), he did not state
adequately that, in accordance with the appellants' interpretation of the
section, it could provide an alternative defence if the conditions of
s. 16(2)  were not satisfied.

 

    The
question of interpreting and applying s. 16(3) has given rise to no
shortage of difficulties since its enactment in the Criminal Code  of
1892. Courts have been required to consider whether s. 16(3)  provides a
separate and independent insanity defence for persons suffering from specific
delusions, whether it simply qualifies the application of s. 16(2)  by
fixing a stricter test for such persons, or whether it merely confirms that
such persons are eligible to claim the benefit of the defence under
s. 16(2) .  Professor Dennis Klinck explores the various plausible
interpretations of s. 16(3)  in """"Specific Delusions"" in the
Insanity Defence"" (1983), 25 Crim. L.Q. 458, at
pp. 464‑67.

 

    Many
of the problems that are involved in the interpretation of s. 16(3) result
from the uncertainty of the terms used.  As a number of authors have duly
noted, the preliminary obstacle that must be overcome is to define the nature
of a specific delusion that does not render a person generally insane.  This
task is not a simple one, since it is not absolutely clear when a specific
delusion becomes a general one or when a basically sane person becomes insane. 
In addition, it can be questioned whether the phrase ""in other respects
sane"" refers to the test set out in s. 16(2)  or to non‑legal
notions of sanity.  Lastly, it is not certain whether s. 16(3) refers to
technical common‑law justifications and excuses for criminal law purposes
or justifications and excuses in a more general, practical sense.

 

    These
issues have caused many writers to question the practical importance of
s. 16(3).  The Report of the Royal Commission on the Law of Insanity as
a Defence in Criminal Cases (McRuer Report) (1956), cited by Professor Stuart in
his textbook, Canadian Criminal Law, op. cit., at
p. 342, recommended that the provision be repealed on account of
redundancy:

 

The
preponderance of medical evidence condemned the wording of this subsection on
the ground that it describes a person who could not exist. The opinion of these
witnesses was that no one who has ""specific delusions"" could be
""in other respects sane"".

 

The Law
Reform Commission of Canada has likewise recommended the elimination of the
rule in Working Paper 29 (affirmed by Report 31, Recodifying Criminal
Law (1987)) at p. 48:

 

[Section
16(3)] has been much criticized and rarely applied. Medical opinion rejects the
idea of partial insanity and legal scholarship stresses the injustice and
illogicality of applying to the mentally abnormal a rule requiring normal
reactions within their abnormality:  a paranoiac killing his persecutor will be
acquitted only if the imagined persecution would have justified the killing by
way of self‑defence ‑‑ the law requires him to be sane in his
insanity.

 

Mewett
and Manning are also in accordance with this view (Criminal Law (2nd
ed. 1985), at pp. 255‑56).

 

    Section
16(3) has rarely been jurisprudentially considered.  In R. v.
Budic (No. 3) (1978), 43 C.C.C. (2d) 419, the Alberta Court of
Appeal held that s. 16(3) could not deprive an accused of the insanity
defence if the conditions of s. 16(2)  were met.  In other words, an accused
suffering from a specific delusion who meets the conditions of the defence set
out in s. 16(2)  cannot be deprived thereof by the apparently more
restrictive condition stipulated by s. 16(3). Similarly, this Court
confirmed in Abbey, supra, that s. 16(3)
does not add to or qualify the general defence under s. 16(2) .  Dickson J.
stated at p. 37:

 

    I
agree with the submission of counsel for the Crown that s. 16(3) of the Code can be
of no assistance to Abbey as his delusion could not in any way
""justify"" or ""excuse"" his actions. In any event, any
defence which could be raised under subsection (3) could also be raised under
subsection (2). See the McRuer Report [citation
omitted], p. 36. [Emphasis added.]

 

    In
my view, it is not necessary for this Court to engage in the difficult and
perhaps impossible task of deciphering the plain meaning of s. 16(3) or of
fathoming the intention of Parliament in enacting the provision. As a result of
this Court's reconsideration of the meaning of the word ""wrong"" in
s. 16(2) , there can be no doubt that any successful attempt to invoke the
insanity defence under s. 16(3) would also succeed under s. 16(2) . 
Furthermore, if an accused fails to satisfy the conditions set out in
s. 16(2) , he or she will not be able to benefit from s. 16(3).  It
would not, therefore, assist an accused in any way if s. 16(3) was indeed
held to constitute a separate and independent defence.

 

    An
accused will be able to invoke the insanity defence successfully under
s. 16(2)  if he can establish that he was incapable of knowing that the act
in question was morally wrong in the particular circumstances. If it is instead
proven that he was capable of knowing or did in fact know that the act was
morally wrong in those circumstances, his claim to the defence will fail.  An
independent defence under s. 16(3) would only be relevant if the accused
suffered from a specific delusion that, if true, would have justified the act,
notwithstanding that the accused knew or was capable of knowing that the
particular act was wrong in those circumstances.

 

    In
my opinion, such a case would be a logical absurdity. Consider, for example,
the following situation.  An individual suffers from the delusion that another
person is attempting to kill her and that she will die unless she herself kills
her apparent attacker.  She therefore acts upon her delusion and kills that
person.  It cannot be denied that her conduct is excused or justified within
the confines of the delusion, since the act of killing was necessary in order
to preserve her own life.  Accordingly, it cannot be said that she knew or was
capable of knowing that the act was morally wrong in the circumstances. 
Although she may well have known that her act amounted to murder and that
murder, as a general rule, is morally wrong, she was prevented by the specific
delusion from being capable of knowing that the act of murder was wrong in the
particular circumstances in which it was committed.  In fact, the delusion
caused her to believe that, while murder normally breaches the moral
standard of society, it was morally right to commit murder in her case.

 

    Conversely,
this logic can be extended in the other direction.  If the specific delusion
had the effect that the individual did not know or was incapable of knowing
that the offence was wrong in the circumstances, it must be admitted that the
act would have been excused or justified had the delusion been true.  If an act
is not known to be morally wrong in a specific situation, an individual is
justified in engaging in such conduct. 

 

    Similarly,
Professor Klinck, op. cit., poses the following question in his analysis of
s. 16(3), at p. 469:

 

    On
the other hand, to say that a person is capable of knowing that an act is
wrong, but may still have a deluded belief in a state of things, which, if
real, would excuse or justify his act is more problematical. To extend the
example above:  A might strike B, knowing what he is doing and knowing that
assault is illegal, or that injuring people is morally wrong. Would
subsec. (2) be unavailable to him if, knowing these things, he was deluded
into believing that he was acting in self‑defence?  Could it not be said
that his delusion led him to perceive circumstances that would make his act
neither morally nor legally wrong?  Or would he have to resort to
subsec. (3), which seems to allow a person to do a ""wrong"" act
if his delusion affords him a justification or excuse?

 

There
can be no doubt as to the answer to this question. An accused will be able to
bring his claim within the scope of the second branch of the test set out in
s. 16(2)  if he proves that he was incapable of knowing that his conduct
was morally wrong in the particular circumstances, for example, if he believed
that the act was necessary to protect his life. If he is not able to establish
this fact, it must be concluded that he either knew or was capable of knowing
that the act was wrong in the circumstances. He cannot then possibly succeed in
claiming that the act would have been justified or excused had the perceived
facts been true.

 

    I
therefore find no flaw in the order of the trial judge except to the extent
that he left open the possibility that the appellants may have succeeded under
s. 16(3) if they did not qualify for the defence under s. 16(2) .
Again, he cannot be faulted given the high degree of uncertainty in the law as
to the effect of s. 16(3).

 

The Rule
Against Splitting the Case

 

    The
appellant Morrissette submits that the trial judge erred in permitting the
Crown to split its case by presenting its evidence with respect to his sanity
in rebuttal.

 

    The
appellant claims that the insanity defence became the dominant issue in the
case from the outset, soon after the counsel for the appellants were retained. 
As a result, the Crown knew long before the trial that the insanity defence
would be invoked and were thus able to consult several psychiatrists before the
trial was held.  The appellants argue that the Crown should have submitted this
evidence as part of its case‑in‑chief.  The appellant Morrissette
states at paragraph 158 of his factum:

 

    In
the present case, the defence was well known and the Crown made a clear
decision to try to split its case. It is submitted that there was a resulting
injustice to the accused, who was effectively denied the opportunity of
hearing the entire case against him before presenting his defence.
[Emphasis added.]

 

The
appellant Morrissette further claims to have taken this position at trial.
Indeed, a motion was made unsuccessfully by the appellant for particulars of
the Crown's evidence with respect to the issue of insanity.  The Court of
Appeal did not address this issue, although the Notice of Appeal by the
appellant Chaulk to the Manitoba Court of Appeal, dated July 14, 1987, 
indicates that the issue was raised before the Court.

 

    It
is my opinion that the trial judge correctly permitted the Crown to adduce
evidence with respect to sanity in rebuttal.  There is no doubt that the Crown
must tender as part of its case the evidence that it relies on to support a
charge against an accused.  It cannot split its case by presenting such
evidence in rebuttal since the accused must be given a fair chance to meet the
case against him. In R. v. Bruno (1975), 27 C.C.C.
(2d) 318 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 320, MacKinnon J.A. summarized the rule
preventing the Crown from splitting its case as follows:

 

    A statement made by Mr. Justice McPherson in R. v.
Drake (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 396 at p. 397
. . . is apposite:

 

    There
is a well‑known principle that evidence which is clearly relevant to the
issues and within the possession of the Crown should be advanced by the Crown
as part of its case, and such evidence cannot properly be admitted after the
evidence for the defence by way of rebuttal. In other words, the law regards it
as unfair for the Crown to lie in wait and to permit the accused to trap
himself. The principle, however, does not apply to evidence which is only
marginally, minimally or doubtfully relevant.

 

It is
therefore apparent that the Crown must tender, as part of its case, evidence
that will establish the existence of all elements of the offence with
which the accused is charged.

 

    The
principle that the Crown is obliged to adduce, as part of its case, only
evidence that is relevant to an element of the offence that the Crown must
prove is affirmed by the corollary principle that the Crown need not adduce
evidence in chief to challenge a defence that an accused might possibly raise. 
I approve of the analysis in this respect of Peter K. McWilliams, Q.C., in Canadian
Criminal Evidence (3rd ed. 1990), at p. 31‑5:

 

    In R. v. Campbell (1977),
38 C.C.C. (2d) 6 (Ont C.A.), Martin, J.A. said at p. 26:

 

    Rebuttal evidence by the prosecution is restricted
to evidence to meet new facts introduced by the defence. The
accused's mere denial of the prosecution's case in the witness‑box does
not permit the prosecution in reply to reiterate its case, or to adduce
additional evidence in support of it. In practice, however, it may often be
difficult to distinguish between evidence, properly the subject of rebuttal,
and evidence of facts relevant to prove guilt which should have been proved in
the first instance by a full presentation of the prosecution's case:  see Wigmore on
Evidence, 3rd ed. (1940), vol. VI at pp. 510‑1.

 

    Clearly
relevant issues may arise during the case for the defence which could not have
been reasonably anticipated by the prosecution before it completed its case.
Indeed, that is the test for the admissibility of rebuttal evidence. The
prosecution may have some anticipation that the defence will raise a defence be
it innocent intent, accident, mistake, necessity or alibi or that the defence
may be calling some expert witness as to the state of mind of the accused or as
to the cause of the injury as in R. v. Campbell
. . . and so on. The defence may give some hint of the line of its
defence in the cross‑examination of Crown witnesses but in many cases it
would be speculative and presumptuous for Crown counsel to anticipate:  R. v.
Perka et al., (1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 405 (B.C.C.A.). It would be,
moreover, difficult and wasteful in time because Crown counsel could not be
sure of just the exact issue or evidence it had to meet. None the less the
prosecution must adduce all the evidence to prove the material ingredient of
the offence.

 

    In
my view, the trial judge in this case correctly allowed the Crown to adduce
rebuttal evidence with respect to the issue of insanity. First, the Crown
cannot be expected to adduce evidence as part of its case‑in‑chief
to meet a defence that the accused might possibly raise; this principle is not
altered by the fact that the accused may warn the Crown that it intends to
raise a particular defence.  Secondly, a requirement that the Crown adduce
evidence in chief to establish the sanity of the accused would defeat the
presumption contained in s. 16(4).  Section 16(4), as discussed above,
posits that every person, for the purposes of the Criminal Code , is
presumed to be sane until the contrary is proven.  As a result, the sanity of a
person accused of committing a criminal offence is not an issue until it is
raised by that accused. The Crown is not obliged to prove the sanity of an
accused as part of its case against such person.  McWilliams makes the
following point in this regard (at p. 31-8):

 

    Section
[16] of the Code imposes the persuasive burden of proof to prove the defence of
insanity on the defence and therefore the prosecution may rebut evidence of
insanity. Similarly, where the defence of insanity was raised the prosecution is
permitted to call rebuttal evidence. R. v. Kasparek (1951),
101 C.C.C. 375 (Ont C.A.); see also R. v. Browne (1943), 29
Cr. App. R. 106.

 

    Lastly,
the arguments raised by the appellant Morrissette in his factum to the effect
that the Crown should have been required to adduce the evidence in question as
part of its case‑in‑chief are not persuasive.  Since the appellants
were given the opportunity for surrebuttal in this case, they are unable to
make a serious argument that they suffered prejudice as a result of the fact
that the Crown's evidence was adduced in rebuttal rather than in chief.

 

Disposition

 

    I
would answer the constitutional questions as follows:

 

1.Is s.
16(4) of the Criminal Code  of Canada
inconsistent with s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer:Yes.

 

2.If the
answer to question 1 is yes, is s. 16(4) justified by s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with
the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

Answer:Yes.

 

    Given
the interpretation that I have given to the word ""wrong"" in
s. 16(2) , I would allow the appeal and order a new trial.

 

//Wilson J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    Wilson J. -‑
I have had the advantage of reading Chief Justice Lamer's reasons in this
appeal.  I agree with him that s. 16(4)  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , infringes s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and that the key issue on this appeal
is whether s. 16(4)  constitutes a reasonable and demonstrably justified limit
on the presumption of innocence under s. 1  of the Charter .  I
take a different approach, however, from my colleague to the pressing and
substantial concern that s. 16(4)  is designed to address and to the standard of
review that this Court should bring to bear on the ""proportionality""
aspect of the Oakes test.

 

    Before
turning to s. 1  I propose to address briefly the conflict which currently
exists between the presumption of innocence guaranteed in s. 11 (d) of the Charter  and the
presumption of sanity embodied in s. 16(4)  of the Criminal Code .  It
may seem strange at first blush to speak of conflict between these two
presumptions in light of the fact that they appear to have happily coexisted at
common law for centuries.  But in order to appreciate how the conflict has come
about it is necessary to advert briefly to the history of each.

 

The
Presumption of Sanity

 

    Section
16(4)  is the current version of a provision that has been in the Criminal
Code  of Canada since its first enactment in 1892.  This
Court discussed its proper interpretation in Clark v. The King (1921),
61 S.C.R. 608.  At that time the section (s. 19(3) ) read:

 

Everyone
shall be presumed to be sane at the time of doing or omitting to do any act
until the contrary is proved.

 

As is
noted in Clark the inspiration for the statutory
presumption was M'Naghten's Case (1843), 10 Cl.
& Fin. 200, 8 E.R. 718 (H.L.), which has provided the model for insanity
defence legislation throughout the Commonwealth ever since.  In that case, Lord
Tindal C.J. said at p. 722:

 

[T]he jurors ought to be told in all cases that every
man is to be presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason
to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their
satisfaction;  and that to establish a defence on the ground of
insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the
act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from
disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was
doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.
[Emphasis added.]

 

    Although
Lord Tindal C.J. did not elaborate on what standard of proof was involved in
""to their satisfaction"" other than to say that it must be
""clearly proved"", it was subsequently established that the standard
was proof on a balance of probabilities (Clark v. The King,
supra, per Duff J., at p. 621).  Thus, the presumption of sanity
in the criminal law has been part of our statutory and common law tradition for
at least 150 years.

 

The
Presumption of Innocence

 

    The
presumption of innocence has traditionally been viewed as the cornerstone of
our criminal justice system.  It is reflected in the axiom that ""It is
better that a guilty person go free than that an innocent person be convicted
of a crime"".  In Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935]
A.C. 462 (H.L.), Viscount Sankey L.C. said at pp. 481-82:

 

If, at
the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt, created
by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the prisoner, as to whether
the prisoner killed the deceased with a malicious intention, the prosecution
has not made out the case and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.  No
matter what the charge or where the trial, the principle that the prosecution
must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of the common law of England and
no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained. [Emphasis added.]

 

    The
presumption of innocence has been carried forward into the Charter .

 

    Section
11 (d) of the Charter  has frequently
been the subject of judicial interpretation in the context of what have come to
be known as reverse onus clauses.  In R. v. Oakes, [1986]
1 S.C.R. 103, Dickson C.J. explained the rationale  of s. 11 (d).  He
said at pp. 119-20:

 

The
presumption of innocence is a hallowed principle lying at the very heart of
criminal law.  Although protected expressly in s. 11 (d) of the Charter , the
presumption of innocence is referable and integral to the general protection of
life, liberty and security of the person contained in s. 7  of the Charter  ... The
presumption of innocence protects the fundamental liberty and human dignity of
any and every person accused by the State of criminal conduct.  An individual
charged with a criminal offence faces grave social and personal consequences,
including potential loss of physical liberty, subjection to social stigma and
ostracism from the community, as well as other social, psychological and
economic harms.  In light of the gravity of these consequences, the
presumption of innocence is crucial.  It ensures that until the State proves an
accused's guilt beyond all reasonable doubt, he or she is innocent.  This is
essential in a society committed to fairness and social justice.  The
presumption of innocence confirms our faith in humankind; it reflects our
belief that individuals are decent and law-abiding members of the community
until proven otherwise. [Emphasis added.]

 

    In Oakes the
constitutional validity of a statutory provision that placed the burden on an
accused to prove that he was not in possession of narcotics for the purposes of
trafficking was challenged.  The majority concluded that this burden violated
s. 11 (d).  Dickson C.J. stated at pp. 132-33:

 

[A]
provision which requires an accused to disprove on a balance of probabilities
the existence of a presumed fact, which is an important element of the
offence in question, violates the presumption of innocence in s. 11 (d).  If
an accused bears the burden of disproving on a balance of probabilities an
essential element of an offence, it would be possible for a conviction to
occur despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.  This would arise if the
accused adduced sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt as to his or
her innocence but did not convince the jury on a balance of probabilities that
the presumed fact was untrue. [Emphasis added.]

 

    In Oakes the
scope of the presumption of innocence was confined to the ""essential
elements"" of the offence.  The prosecution had to bear the burden of proof
of all the essential elements.  A reversal of the onus of proof of any of these
essential elements violated the presumption of innocence.

 

    Since Oakes there
has been a gradual broadening of the scope of s. 11 (d).  The
decisions of this Court in R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
636, R. v. Holmes, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 914, and R. v. Whyte, [1988]
2 S.C.R. 3, have removed the qualification present in Oakes that
limited the applicability of the presumption of innocence to the essential
elements of the offence.  In Whyte, Dickson C.J. (writing for the
Court) unequivocally rejected any such qualification.  He said at p. 18:

 

    The short answer... is that the distinction between
elements of the offence and other aspects of the charge is irrelevant to the s.
11 (d) inquiry.  The real concern is not whether the accused
must disprove an element or prove an excuse, but that an accused may be
convicted while a reasonable doubt exists.  When that possibility exists, there
is a breach of the presumption of innocence.

 

    The
exact characterization of a factor as an essential element, a collateral
factor, an excuse, or a defence should not affect the analysis of the
presumption of innocence.  It is the final effect of a provision on the verdict
that is decisive.  If an accused is required to prove some fact on the
balance of probabilities to avoid conviction, the provision violates the
presumption of innocence because it permits a conviction in spite of a
reasonable doubt in the mind of the trier of fact as to the guilt of the
accused. [Emphasis added.]

 

    The
Court decided, in other words, that if we are to take the presumption of
innocence seriously, it should not matter whether the reverse onus relates to
an essential element of the offence as defined in the Criminal
Code  or to an independent defence, excuse or justification. 
To hold otherwise would be to make the ultimate determination of the guilt or
innocence of an accused depend upon the contingencies of legislative drafting
rather than upon the more basic philosophical underpinnings of the presumption
of innocence.  It is, as Dickson C.J. emphasized, ""the final effect
of a provision on the verdict that is decisive"".

 

    The
respondent relies, however, upon the reasons of the majority of this Court in R. v.
Schwartz, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 443, to support its submission that s.
16(4)  does not infringe the presumption of innocence because it creates an
exemption rather than a defence.  I believe that the respondent's reliance on Schwartz is
misplaced.  It seems to me that in Schwartz McIntyre J.,
writing for the majority, refused to apply to regulatory or licencing schemes
the same strict standard in respect of the presumption of innocence as applies
to criminal prohibitions even although the regulatory or licencing scheme
arises in the criminal law context.  Quoting from his reasons at p. 486:

 

The
theory behind any licencing system is that when an issue arises as to the
possession of the licence, it is the accused who is in the best position to
resolve the issue.  Otherwise, the issuance of the certificate or licence would
serve no useful purpose.

 

McIntyre
J. accordingly did not perceive the requirement that the accused establish that
he had a licence as involving the imposition of a reverse onus in the Whyte sense.  Schwartz, in my
view, is distinguishable from the Vaillancourt, Holmes and Whyte line of
cases on the ground that it deals with regulated not prohibited activity.

 

    As
already mentioned, Whyte stands for the proposition that it is
the net effect of a reverse onus provision on the final guilt or innocence of
the accused rather than the precise nature of the provision that must be
examined under s. 11 (d).  It is this expansion of Oakes in Whyte that
has given rise to the constitutional challenge to the presumption of sanity
under s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  The presumption
of sanity requires the accused to establish his or her insanity on a balance of
probabilities and, however one conceives the plea of insanity, whether as an
exemption, a defence, a justification or an excuse, the persuasive burden
imposed on the accused by s. 16(4)  permits him or her to be convicted of a
crime despite the existence of a reasonable doubt as to his or her guilt.  This
offends the presumption of innocence on the authority of Whyte.

 

    The
constitutional validity of s. 16(4)  depends therefore upon whether it can be
saved under s. 1 .

 

Section
1  of the Charter 

 

    The Oakes test
requires first the identification of a pressing and substantial concern to
which the impugned legislation is addressed.  The government objective must be
sufficiently important to warrant overriding a Charter  right;
otherwise the inquiry stops here and the legislation is unconstitutional.  The
first task is therefore to identify the government objective at which s. 16(4) 
of the Criminal Code  is aimed and to assess whether it is of sufficient
importance to justify an infringement on what is arguably one of the most, if
not the most, fundamental tenet of our criminal justice system.

 

    I
start from the premise that the government must have been of the view that it
was necessary to impose a persuasive burden on the accused to prove his
insanity on a balance of probabilities in order to prevent perfectly sane
persons who had committed crimes from escaping criminal liability on tenuous
insanity pleas.  In other words, the government must have concluded that the
imposition of a purely evidentiary burden on the accused, i.e. the burden of
adducing sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt in the minds of the
jury as to his sanity was not enough.  Hence the presumption of sanity and the
reverse onus on the accused to prove insanity, bringing s. 16(4)  into conflict
with s. 11 (d) of the Charter  as explained in Whyte.

 

    If I
am correct in my starting premise, then it would appear that under the first
branch of Oakes the government would have to adduce
evidence under s. 1  to show that this was a real social problem, that perfectly
sane persons who had committed crimes were in significant numbers escaping
criminal liability on tenuous insanity pleas and that something had to be done
about it.

 

    There
is, however, a difficulty here because s. 16(4)  merely reflects what, as we
have seen, was already the common law and had been the common law for some time
prior even to the enactment of the original section in Canada's first Criminal
Code .  There is therefore no historic experience in our
jurisdiction with a purely evidentiary burden in order to show that such a burden
was not adequate to achieve the government's objective.

 

    My
colleague sees the pressing and substantial concern somewhat differently.  He
says that the government objective was to relieve the prosecution of the
""impossibly onerous burden"" of proving the sanity of the accused
beyond a reasonable doubt which it would have to do, he says, if the burden on
the accused was merely an evidentiary one.  In other words, my colleague
narrows the characterization of the government objective to a purely procedural
one arising in the context of the trial.  He sees s. 16(4)  as ""a purely
evidentiary section whose objective is to relieve the prosecution of the
tremendous difficulty of proving an accused's sanity in order to secure a
conviction,"" (p. 000).  He does not identify any pressing and
substantial concern to which this has in fact given rise.  The provision
is, in effect, a prophylactic measure designed to guard against a possible
problem that might arise absent the reverse onus.

 

    I am
of the view that this represents a significant departure from the approach
taken to s. 1  by this Court up until now.  This Court has consistently
evaluated laws subject to Charter  challenge in terms of their
justifiability as a response to existing social problems.  The pressing social
problem at which s. 16(4)  is aimed must, it seems to me, be the one I have
already identified, namely that guilty persons were escaping criminal liability
on tenuous insanity pleas.  Accordingly, if the accused wished to plead
insanity it was essential that he be made to bear the persuasive burden.  The
prosecution must be given a ""leg up"" through the enactment of a
presumption of sanity and the imposition on the accused of the burden of
proving insanity on a balance of probabilities.  Otherwise, as my colleague
says, an accused whose sanity is in doubt might escape conviction.

 

    I
pause here to emphasize that, in my view, by analogy to the presumption of
innocence, it is better that a guilty person be found not guilty by reason of
insanity and committed for psychiatric treatment than an insane person be
convicted of a crime.

 

    Unlike
my colleague, I do not believe that subs. (4) of s. 16 can be
considered apart from subss. (2) and (3).  The presumption in
subs. (4) is accordingly operative to presume that the accused did not
have disease of the mind (or natural imbecility) which made him incapable of
appreciating the nature or quality of his act or of knowing that it was wrong
at the time he did it.  If the accused merely had the evidentiary burden and he
or she succeeded in producing evidence sufficient to raise a doubt in the minds
of the jury that one of these elements was present, then the prosecution
clearly must dispel that doubt.  Although I agree that the burden on the
prosecution is not an easy one, I think it overstates the case to say that it
is an ""impossibly onerous"" one.  It is not, in my opinion, a matter
of the prosecution's having to prove sanity in a vacuum;  it is a matter of
removing any doubt raised by the accused in the minds of the jury as to the
presence of any of the elements spelled out in subss. (2) or (3).  The
extent of the burden on the prosecution will vary from case to case depending
upon the evidence of insanity which the accused is able to produce, assuming
that such evidence is sufficient to raise a doubt at all in the minds of the
jury as to his sanity.  The prosecution's task is simply to address any doubt
raised by specific evidence adduced by the accused to support his or her
insanity plea.  The prosecution faces this kind of challenge all the time in
cases where, for example, drunkenness is raised as a defence.  It is my view
that the burden is not an ""impossibly onerous"" one.

 

    Be
that as it may, I do not believe that Lamer C.J.'s characterization of the
pressing and substantial concern succeeds in any event in overcoming the hurdle
of the absence of any historic experience with a purely evidentiary burden.

 

    The
question posed by the Chief Justice's approach, it seems to me, is therefore
whether s. 16(4) of the Code can be justified under s. 1  as a
prophylactic measure designed to fend off a hypothetical social problem that
might arise if accused persons pleading insanity had to meet only an
evidentiary burden.  This prompts me to ask:  do we wish to go down this path
and justify infringements of guaranteed Charter  rights
on a purely hypothetical basis?  And, in particular, do we wish to go down this
path where such a fundamental tenet of our justice system as the presumption of
innocence is at stake?  I have serious reservations about adopting such a
course even in cases where it could be said that the hypothesis was a strong
one which I do not think it is in this instance for reasons which I will
discuss later.  Before adopting such a course I would prefer to look elsewhere
to see what the experience has been in other free and democratic societies
which have had the experience of living with the purely evidentiary burden.

 

1.  The
United States Experience

 

    Given
the lack of available data in Canada and the Commonwealth, it makes good sense
in applying s. 1  of the Charter  to turn to other societies where the
accused who pleads insanity faces the lower evidentiary burden.  Indeed, this
Court endorsed that approach in Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [1984]
1 S.C.R. 357, per Estey J., at pp. 367-68.  The United States presents an
excellent source for this type of information since American criminal law is a
matter of state jurisdiction and the states are fairly evenly split on the
issue of the appropriate standard of proof that an accused pleading insanity
should have to meet.

 

    (a) 
United States Jurisprudence

 

    The
starting point for an analysis of the American law concerning the appropriate
standard of proof on the accused is the landmark ruling of the U.S. Supreme
Court in Davis v. United States, 160 U.S. 469
(1895).  The Assistant Attorney General in Davis argued
that insanity is a fairly easy condition to feign or simulate and that there
are strong policy reasons for imposing a persuasive burden.  He identified the
policy reasons as follows (at p. 473):

 

The
probability of a jury finding an insane man guilty, under the rule that
insanity must be established to their reasonable satisfaction, is very slight
as compared with the evil that results to society from the application of the
doctrine that a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant is sane or insane
must be followed by acquittal.

 

The
""evil"" to which he referred was that ""[m]erely doubtful evidence
of insanity would fill the land with acquitted criminals"" (Ortwein v.
Commonwealth, 76 Pa. 414 (1874), at p. 425).  After an extensive
review of the authorities, the Supreme Court squarely rejected this line of
argument in a unanimous judgment (per Harlan J., at pp.
492-93 and 488):

 

    It seems to us that undue stress is placed in some
of the cases upon the fact that, in prosecutions for murder the defence of
insanity is frequently resorted to and is sustained by the evidence of
ingenious experts whose theories are difficult to be met and overcome.  Thus,
it is said, crimes of the most atrocious character often go unpunished, and the
public safety is thereby endangered.  But the possibility of such results
must always attend any system devised to ascertain and punish crime, and ought
not to induce the courts to depart from principles fundamental in criminal law,
and the recognition and enforcement of which are demanded by every
consideration of humanity and justice....

 

How then
upon principle or consistently with humanity can a verdict of guilty be
properly returned, if the jury entertain a reasonable doubt as to the existence
of a fact which is essential to guilt, namely, the capacity in law of the
accused to commit that crime? [Emphasis added.]

 

Harlan
J. was of the view that the crime of murder ""necessarily involves""
the possession of a mental capacity by the accused that is sufficient to
attribute criminal responsibility.  He stressed that the risk of acquitting
guilty people accompanies any criminal justice system that requires guilt to be
proven beyond a reasonable doubt and that the insanity defence was not
exceptional in this regard.  As such, the policy considerations did not warrant
a departure from the fundamental principle that the prosecution should bear the
burden of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  This reasoning has
been consistently approved in subsequent Supreme Court cases: see In Re
Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970); Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421
U.S. 684 (1975); Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307
(1979).  Thus, the Davis case set down the rule which has
governed federal criminal procedure in the United States for the past 95 years,
namely that when there is evidence before the trier of fact tending to show
that the accused was criminally insane at the relevant time, the burden shifts
to the prosecution to show beyond a reasonable doubt that he in fact had the
requisite mental capacity to be held criminally responsible.

 

    In
my view, the factors which were taken into account by the United States Supreme
Court in Davis are precisely those which Lamer C.J.
invites us to consider in the present appeal.  Harlan J. had to decide whether
placing the lower evidentiary burden on the accused would result in an
impossibly onerous burden on the prosecution and therefore in unwarranted
acquittals.  He found that it would not.  The fact that this decision has stood
unchallenged for almost a century tends to persuade me that the lower burden on
the accused has not created a pressing and substantial problem in American
society.

 

    It
is noted, however, that the ratio decidendi in Davis turned
on the supervisory powers of the Supreme Court and not, strictly speaking, on
constitutional grounds.  Thus, in Leland v. Oregon, 343
U.S. 790 (1952), it was explicitly held to be permissible for a state to shift
the persuasive burden for insanity claims onto the shoulders of the accused. 
Accordingly, a number of states have imposed a persuasive burden on the accused
for offences within their criminal jurisdiction.  Leland was
upheld in Rivera v. Delaware, 351 A.2d 561
(Del. 1976), appeal dismissed (Brennan and Marshall JJ. dissenting), 429 U.S.
877 (1976).  The criminal trial process for those states that impose the
persuasive burden is much the same as ours in Canada.  It is incumbent on the
accused to establish his or her insanity on a balance of probabilities.

 

    In
jurisdictions that impose only an evidentiary burden on the accused the
procedure, including the burden on the prosecution, is explained by the First
Circuit Court of Appeal in United States v. Pasarell, 727 F.2d 13
(1984), certiorari denied, 105 S. Ct. 107 (1984), at p. 14:

 

    When a defendant introduces evidence of insanity,
the  prosecution has the burden of proving him sane.  In United
States v. Dube. . . , this court
described the prosecution's burden in these terms:

 

""Insanity
is a jury question unless a reasonable man viewing the facts and reasonable
inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the prosecution must
necessarily possess a reasonable doubt as to the defendant's sanity.  The
nature and quantum of rebuttal evidence sufficient to present a jury question
is to some extent determined by the strength of the case for insanity.  There
is no general principle that the prosecution must counter defendant's expert
medical evidence with expert testimony of its own.  The expert testimony is
not conclusive even where uncontradicted; its weight and credibility are for
the jury to determine...""  [Emphasis added; citations omitted.]

 

In these
jurisdictions the courts are very reluctant to interfere with the jury's
finding of fact as to the mental state of the accused: see United
States v. Voice, 627 F.2d 138 (8th Cir. 1980);  United
States v. Samuels, 801 F.2d 1052 (8th Cir. 1986); People v.
Stockwell, 242 N.W.2d 559 (Mich. Ct. App. 1976).  It is also
important to note that the jury is not bound by expert witnesses:

 

The jury is the ultimate judge of defendant's sanity at
the time of the crime, and in this case, since it had before it evidence of
defendant's behaviour and state of mind upon the basis of which it could have
found defendant sane at that time, it was not bound by the expert opinion
testimony of the doctor.

 

    (People v.
Krugman, 141 N.W.2d 33 (Mich. 1966), at p. 35.)

 

Nor, as
the Pasarell case makes clear, is there an obligation on the
prosecution to ""match"" expert testimony.  This would seem to undercut
the argument often advanced by proponents of the persuasive burden that a
merely evidentiary burden on the accused tends to produce a ""battle of the
experts"" that leaves the jurors confused and often results in unjustified
acquittals.  It appears that in these jurisdictions leaving the determination
of sanity, like the determination of other crucial questions of fact, to the
good common sense and considered judgment of the jury has not presented any
particular problem.

 

    The
American cases do not, in my view, support the conclusion that the higher
burden on the accused is indispensable for the proper administration of
criminal justice nor do they confirm the existence of the type of pressing and
substantial concern that Lamer C.J. believes would arise if the persuasive
burden on the accused were to be removed.

 

    (b) 
Commentary on the American Experience

 

    Canadian
commentators have looked to the American experience for guidance in this
matter.  In ""A Critique of Proposals to Reform the Insanity Defence""
(1989), 14 Queen's L.J. 135, Professor G.
Ferguson evaluates what he calls the ""pragmatic considerations"" in
favour of keeping the persuasive burden on the accused.  They are (at
p. 148):

 

    (i)to reduce the likelihood of successful
fabrication of the  insanity defence;

 

    (ii)a reasonable doubt about the accused's sanity
can be created too easily; [and]

 

    (iii)proving
the accused's sanity beyond a reasonable doubt is impossible.

 

He
states at p. 148:

 

    Upon
closer examination, these pragmatic considerations lack validity.  The
experience in the United States is particularly revealing.  As of 1982, in half
of the States and in all federal courts, once there is some evidence of
insanity, the prosecution has the burden of proving the accused's sanity beyond
a reasonable doubt.  Does that burden allow a throng of fabricated insanity
pleas to succeed?  Does it put an intolerable or impossible burden on the
Crown?  I sampled the reported cases in those jurisdictions for the year
1982.  In almost all of the cases there was at least some expert evidence
supporting the accused's insanity plea.  But in twenty-eight of the thirty
cases, the defence of insanity failed.  The Crown proved its case; the accused
failed to raise a reasonable doubt.  If anything, these figures suggest that
even raising a reasonable doubt about insanity may be too difficult a standard
to meet rather than one which is too facile.  (Incidentally, in
jurisdictions where the accused had the burden of proof on a balance of
probabilities, the accused's insanity plea failed sixteen times in seventeen
cases.) [Emphasis added.]

 

    It
would appear that in the United States the evidentiary burden has not resulted
in a flood of accused persons being found not guilty by reason of insanity. 
Nor have the Americans witnessed a great rush of insanity pleas.  As the
American Psychiatric Association notes in its Statement on the
Insanity Defence issued in 1982:

 

(S)uccessful invocation of the [insanity] defence is
rare (probably involving a fraction of one percent of all felony cases).  While
philosophically important for the criminal law, the insanity defense is empirically
unimportant.

 

(See
R. J. Simon and D. E. Aaronson, The Insanity Defense:
A Critical Assessment of Law and Policy in the Post‑Hinckley Era (1988),
at p 8.)

 

    Statistics
gathered from follow-up studies on NGRI acquittees (Not Guilty by Reason of
Insanity) in both countries tend to indicate that not many mistakes are being
made.  In Canadian statistical materials provided to this Court by the parties
(S. Hodgins et al., Annual Report, Year 1 Canadian Data Base: Patients Held
on Lieutenant Governor's Warrants (1989), Table 5,  ""A Description
of Patients Under Lieutenant Governors' Warrant March 1, 1988""), the most
common reported mental disorders among detainees were: schizophrenia (65.3%),
personality disorders (11.9%), affective disorders (7.6%), delusional paranoid
disorders (6.9%), and mental retardation (4.2%).  On the other hand, only
0.2% of the patients were found to have ""No Diagnosis"".  This
figure means that only 2 of the 1007 detainees under the L.G.W. system in 1988
were found to have no mental disorder.

 

    In
the United States, a somewhat less recent study of NGRI Admissions to Saint
Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington D.C. also tends to support the proposition
that most acquittees are in fact in need of psychiatric treatment.  Arthur
Matthews Jr. consolidated the psychiatric diagnoses of NGRI acquittees over a
12‑year period (1954-1965).  He found schizophrenia to be the most
prevalent mental disorder (39.1%).  His research indicates that only 5.5% of
NGRIs were found to be ""Without Mental Disorder"":  see Mental
Disability and the Criminal Law: a Field Study (1970), at p. 35. 
Although significantly higher than the Canadian statistics, these figures, in
my view, do not indicate that successfully fabricated insanity pleas have given
rise to a pressing and substantial problem in the United States.

 

    (c) Recommendations
Respecting the Burden of Proof in American States

 

    The
American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Association Standards for
Criminal Justice has done extensive research on the problems associated with
mental disability and the criminal justice system.  The First
Tentative Draft: Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards (1983),
reviews the state of the law and sets out recommendations for allocating the
burden of proof in insanity cases (at pp. 291-93):

 

Standard 7-6.9.  Burden of production and burden of
persuasion

 

    (a)The defendant should have the burden of assuring
that evidence of insanity is introduced.

 

    (b) Once evidence of insanity has been introduced at
trial, the burden of persuasion should be allocated as follows:

 

(i) in jurisdictions utilizing any test for insanity
which focuses solely on whether the defendant, as a result of mental disease or
was unable to know, understand or appreciate the wrongfulness of his or her
conduct at the time of the offense charged, the prosecution should have the
burden of disproving the defendant's claim of insanity beyond a reasonable
doubt; 

 

(ii) in jurisdictions utilizing the ALI-Model Penal Code
test for insanity, the defendant should have the burden of proving the claim of
insanity by a preponderance of the evidence.

 

    (c)
Nothing contained in paragraph (b) above relieves the prosecution of its burden
of proving beyond a reasonable doubt all elements of the offense charged
including the mental state required for the offense charged.

 

Commentary

 

... The difficult question concerns the allocation
of the burden of persuasion once the issue has been raised....

 

At the present time, the states are closely divided on
this question:  twenty-six states (and the District of Columbia in nonfederal
cases) place the burden of proving insanity on the defendant, (usually) by a
preponderance of the evidence.  In contrast, twenty-four states require the
prosecution to prove the defendant's sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.  In the
federal courts, the burden is borne by the prosecution....

 

                                                                         ...

 

... Paragraph (b) provides that the burden should
fall upon the prosecution to disprove a defendant's claim of insanity in those
states using a test which focuses solely on whether the defendant, as a result
of mental disease or defect, was unable to know, understand or appreciate the
wrongfulness of his conduct.  This embrace of the Davis
doctrine recognizes that a narrowing of the insanity test requires that the
""risk of error"" remain with the prosecution.  In
contrast, the second part provides that jurisdictions employing the combined
cognitive-volitional test should shift the burden of proof to the defendant,
recognizing the right of jurisdictions to place the burden on the defendant
when that defendant is the recipient of the possible benefits flowing from an
expanded insanity test.  The shift is thus a quid pro quo for the
greater latitude implicit within the volitional part of the test.

 

    The
allocation formula is based on the view that mistakes in the administration of
the insanity defense occur primarily when the volitional prong of the current
ALI-Model Penal Code formulation is the test employed.... Conversely,
because the risk of mistake is greatly reduced under a cognitive test, the
reduction of risk in such cases supports the view that there is no
justification for shifting the burden of proof to the defendant. [Emphasis
added.]

 

    I
note that formulation of the insanity defence in s. 16(2) of the Code employs
a cognitive test.  As such, the ABA recommendations would indicate that ceteris
paribus the lower evidentiary burden is appropriate in the
Canadian context.

 

2. 
Recommendations in Canada

 

    Canadian
commentators have reached similar conclusions concerning the appropriate burden
of proof for the insanity defence.  In  The Presumption of
Innocence in the Draft Code of Substantive Criminal Law (1986),
an unpublished paper prepared for the Law Reform Commission of Canada by
Professor Patrick Healy, the author examines the insanity issue within the
context of reverse onus clauses generally.  He says (at paras. 29 and 32):

 

29. ... the two principal rationales for the reverse
onus are animated by notions of efficiency and convenience, and thus suggest
that reverse onuses are expedient devices....  [T]herefore, it must be asked
whether considerations of expediency carry enough force to overtake the general
rule regarding the burden of proof....  

 

32.  It
is submitted that neither the difficulty of proving a negative or the
difficulty of acquiring affirmative evidence of facts on which the accused
might be the best witness is possessed of such overriding force that they
justify a rule that would require the accused to prove his innocence....

 

He
further notes (at paras. 35 and 36) that:

 

35.  The reverse onus with respect to insanity is an
anachronistic vestige of the era in which the accused bore the burden to
disprove guilt once the prosecution had established a prima
facie case with regard to actus reus of the
offence.  The allocation of the onus probandi in this
instance, however, was fortified by the so-called presumption of sanity and the
presumption that the accused intended the natural and probable consequences of
his act.  These two presumptions effectively created a presumption of mens rea and
their combined force ensured the survival of this particular reverse onus at
common law long after the end of the nineteenth century, by which time the
courts had largely reversed the older doctrine that the prosecution need only
establish the actus reus and that, to avoid conviction, the
presumption of mens rea required the accused to prove his
innocence by proving a viable justification, excuse or defence.

 

36.  The
general presumption of mens rea, at least as a mandatory presumption
arising upon the prosecution's prima facie case, is now a
thing of the past, and although the presumption of sanity has survived its sole
utility is to state that the sanity of the accused is not an implied or
necessary element in the prosecution's case.  In more recent times the
rationales advanced most frequently for the reverse onus in insanity are not
materially different from the rationales given for other reverse onuses:  the
mental state of the accused is exceptionally difficult to ascertain and only
the accused is best equipped to provide relevant evidence on the issue.  If the
most compelling justification for allocating the onus probandi to the
accused on this issue is to ensure that it does not avail to his benefit
without a secure evidentiary foundation, then neither a presumption of
sanity nor the allocation is necessary or desirable in a new code. 
Accordingly, the draft ought to stipulate in specific terms the essential
elements of each offence and sanity (or insanity) would therefore not be an
issue unless specifically raised by either party.  The salient interests in
policy are satisfied not by requiring proof once the issue is raised, but by
ensuring that the issue need only be negatived when the defence makes a
sufficient case for doing so.  Such a burden is not lightly undertaken nor
easily discharged and there is no compelling reason of principle, or even of
utility, to distinguish it from provocation, duress, and self-defence. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

    Professor
Colvin is also of the view that the lower burden deserves serious
consideration.  He states at p. 241 of Principles of
Criminal Law (1986):

 

    The
placement of the persuasive burden should now be vulnerable to a constitutional
challenge under s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ....
[I]nsanity is the only defence of deficient mental capacity for which the onus
of proof is now reversed.  If the efficiency of the criminal justice system can
withstand the prosecution carrying the persuasive burden for the other
defences, why should it be supposed that a reverse onus is of crucial
importance for insanity?

 

    I
would note that the Law Reform Commission embraced this lower burden of proof
in Report 31, Recodifying Criminal Law (1987).  The
Commission states at p. 4:

 

In the Commission's view the prosecution should prove
all necessary conditions of liability by evidence which is admissible and which
in the judgement of the trier of fact proves them beyond reasonable doubt,
while the accused should not have to prove any fact in issue in a criminal
trial.  This burden of proof obliges the prosecution, therefore, not only to
prove all inculpatory elements of a crime but also to disprove any matter of
exculpation for which the evidence adduced (irrespective of its source)
discloses a foundation.  By contrast, an accused, when seeking to plead a
matter of exculpation not already raised by the evidence, need only produce
sufficient evidence to disclose such a foundation.  Meanwhile the prosecution
need not disprove any matter of defence, justification or excuse before such
foundation is disclosed.

 

    In
line with this approach, the Commission has refrained ... from casting a legal
burden on an accused regarding any matter of exculpation.  On the one hand
such reverse onuses may well be contrary to the presumption of innocence and
paragraph 11 (d) of the Charter .  On the other
hand they are also unnecessary, because sufficient protection against
unwarranted acquittals lies in the requirement that any matter of exculpation
be based on a demonstrable evidentiary foundation. [Emphasis added.]

 

3. 
Recommendations in Great Britain

 

    It
is of note that the English Criminal Law Revision Committee has come to the
same conclusion regarding the appropriate burden of proof.  In the Eleventh
Report of the English Criminal Law Revision Committee, Evidence
(General) (1972), the eminent jurists state at pp. 88-90:

 

    140.  We are strongly of the opinion that, both on
principle and for the sake of clarity and convenience in practice, burdens on
the defence should be evidential only.... Our reasons are given below.

 

(i)In the typical case where the essence of the offence
is that the offender has acted with blameworthy intent, and the defence which
the accused has the burden of proving implies that he had no such intent but
acted wholly innocently, it seems to us repugnant to principle that the jury or
magistrates' court should be under a legal duty, if they are left in doubt
whether or not the accused had the guilty intent, to convict him.  For this is
what the law requires. ... It may well be that this kind of situation does not
occur at all commonly but that in practice the prosecution assume [sic] the
burden of proving the whole case; for in our 6th report we mentioned (in
relation to a suggestion to create an offence with a persuasive burden on the
accused) that ""the experience of members of the committee in the case of
similar provisions as regards existing offences suggests that in practice
provisions of this kind are less efficacious than may have been hoped when they
were enacted, because juries are sometimes unwilling to convict unless the prosecution
leads evidence sufficient to rule out the defence"".  But even if so, it
seems to us undesirable that the possibility which we mentioned should continue
to exist even in theory.  If provisions of this kind have indeed little or no
effect, the case for altering them seems, if anything, stronger.

 

                                                                         ...

 

(v)The change would get rid of the present need for the
judge to give the jury the complicated direction on the difference between the
burden on the prosecution of proving a matter beyond reasonable doubt and that
on the defence of proving a matter on a balance of probabilities.  Many judges
have said that they find it difficult or impossible to direct juries on this in
a way which the jury are likely to find satisfactory or even intelligible.

 

We propose
also that the burden of proving insanity as a defence should be made an
evidential one.  The present rule that it is a persuasive burden is, in our
opinion, anomalous and open to most of the objections stated in this paragraph
to the statutory persuasive burdens.... The great majority of those whom we
consulted in 1968 were in favour of the proposed change.  A few, however,
opposed it, chiefly on the ground that it would be an unwarranted departure
from the policy of Parliament in a number of enactments.  But we do not regard
this as sufficient to outweigh the arguments mentioned above.
[Emphasis added.]

 

They
also stress that even the lower burden on the accused is not an inconsequential
or trivial one (at pp. 87-88):

 

    138. ...

 

The
words ""a live issue fit and proper to be left to the jury"" show that
it is not enough for the defence merely to allege the fact in question:  the
court decides whether there is a real issue on the matter.  Therefore, when
the burden is an evidential one, there is no need for the judge to mention the
burden to the jury at all.  If he decides that there is insufficient evidence
to raise an issue on the matter, he directs the jury that they must take the
matter as proved against the defence.  If he decides that there is sufficient
evidence to raise an issue on the matter, he simply directs the jury in the
ordinary way that it is for the prosecution to satisfy them on the matter
beyond reasonable doubt.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    In
short, the lower burden on the accused who pleads insanity is seen as being
both more consonant with fundamental principles of criminal law and as a
sufficiently high threshold to prevent insanity pleas in cases where there is
only tenuous support for such a plea.

 

    The
respondent, for the reasons discussed above, has not been able to establish
that s. 16(4)  of the Criminal Code  was aimed at an
existing pressing and substantial concern and, while it may be that the
legislature need not necessarily wait until such a concern has arisen, I do not
believe that the respondent has succeeded in establishing even a likelihood of
its arising.  I would conclude therefore that the first requirement of the Oakes test
has not been met.  However, in case I am wrong in this I propose to go on to
consider whether s. 16(4)  meets the proportionality aspect of Oakes.

 

4.  The
Proportionality Test

 

    There
are three parts to the proportionality test in Oakes.  I do
not take issue with Lamer C.J.'s conclusion on the first of these that s. 16(4) 
is rationally connected to the legislative objective being sought, whether that
objective is perceived in his narrow terms or in my broader terms.  The second
part is commonly referred to as the ""minimal impairment"" test and
poses more difficulty.

 

    The
issue under this part of the Oakes test is whether some other
legislative provision could achieve the desired objective while impairing the Charter  right
""as little as possible"".  Lamer C.J. is of the view that Parliament
is not required to seek and adopt ""the absolutely least intrusive means of
attaining its objective"" (p. 000).  He indicates that he is unwilling
to embark on a course of ""second-guessing"" the wisdom of Parliament's
choice of legislative means and cites some recent decisions of this Court as
authority for this deferential attitude.  In my view, this is not a case for
deference.  In one of the cases on which the Chief Justice relies, Irwin Toy
Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927, this Court
indicated that there might be exceptions to the stringent review called for
under this part of the Oakes test.  Whether or not such an
exception was warranted would depend upon the role Parliament was fulfilling in
enacting the impugned legislation.

 

    As I
understand this aspect of Irwin Toy, an exception may be made where the
legislature mediating between the competing claims of groups of citizens or
allocating scarce resources among them is forced to strike a compromise on the
basis of conflicting evidence.  In such cases there will be a substantial
policy component to the choice of means selected by the legislature and that
choice should be respected even if it cannot be said to represent the
""least intrusive means"".  In my view, Irwin Toy does
not stand for the proposition that in balancing the objective of government
against the guaranteed right of the citizen under s. 1  different levels of
scrutiny may be applied depending upon the nature of the right.  The
prerequisite for the exception to the minimal impairment test in Oakes, as I
understand Irwin Toy, is that the guaranteed right of
different groups of citizens cannot be fully respected; to respect to the full
the right of one group will necessarily involve an infringement upon the right
of the other.  In such a circumstance Irwin Toy holds
that it is appropriate for the government to fashion a compromise on the basis
of policy considerations.

 

    In Irwin Toy the
Court went on to contrast the ""competing claims"" situation with the
situation in which no exception to the strict test in Oakes should
be permitted.  Lamer J. (as he then was) concurred in the following
passage appearing at p. 994 of the majority opinion.  It seems apposite to the
case at bar:

 

    In
other cases, however, rather than mediating between different groups, the
government is best characterized as the singular antagonist of the individual
whose right has been infringed.  For example, in justifying an infringement
of legal rights enshrined in ss. 7  to 14  of the Charter , the
state, on behalf of the whole community, typically will assert its
responsibility for prosecuting crime whereas the individual will assert the
paramountcy of principles of fundamental justice.  There might not
be any further competing claims among different groups.  In such circumstances,
and indeed whenever the government's purpose relates to maintaining the
authority and impartiality of the judicial system, the courts can assess
with some certainty whether the ""least drastic means"" for achieving
the purpose have been chosen, especially given their accumulated experience in
dealing with such questions...  [Emphasis added.]

 

    I
re-emphasized this distinction in United States of America v. Cotroni, [1989]
1 S.C.R. 1469, at pp. 1515-16:

 

    In
coming to this conclusion I am not unmindful of the comments of La Forest J.
that a flexible approach should be taken in some cases to the proportionality
test in R. v. Oakes.  However, this does not seem to me to be one of those
cases.  It is one thing to temper scrutiny of legislation and relax the general
approach to ""fine tuning"" when dealing with alternate forms of
business regulation (see R. v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd., [1986]
2 S.C.R. 713, per Dickson C.J., at p. 772) and another thing entirely
to abandon careful scrutiny of a legislative scheme which directly abridges a
guaranteed right particularly in relation to an aspect of the criminal law.
[Emphasis added.]

 

    In
my view, this is not a situation calling for a departure from the strict
standard of review set forth in Oakes.  On the contrary,
the issue on appeal seems to be the quintessential case of the state acting as
the ""singular antagonist"" of a very basic legal right of the accused
rather than in the role of ""mediating between different groups"" as
discussed in Irwin Toy.  This is, in my view, an appropriate
case in which to apply the stricter standard of review on the ""minimal
impairment"" issue.

 

    The
appellants submit that the government's objective can be met by imposing only
an evidentiary burden on the accused and they cite the American experience in
support.  I agree that the American experience is relevant to the minimal
impairment issue as well as to the existence of a pressing and substantial
concern because a substantial number of states have the lesser requirement that
once the issue of insanity is put into play by the accused, the prosecution
must prove his or her sanity beyond a reasonable doubt:  24 states as of 1983: 
see American Bar Association's First Tentative Draft: Criminal Justice
Mental Health Standards, op. cit., at p. 292.  This is also the rule which has
governed all federal crimes in the United States ever since the Davis case.

 

    As
mentioned earlier, the U.S. Supreme Court specifically rejected in Davis the
argument that insanity is a fairly easy condition to feign or simulate and that
""[m]erely doubtful evidence of insanity would fill the land with acquitted
criminals"".  The case made by Harlan J., speaking for the unanimous
court, may have become even stronger as the state of psychological and psychiatric
knowledge has increased.  The argument is sometimes advanced that feigning
insanity is easy but in fact it appears that nothing is further from the
truth.  As the body of scientific and diagnostic knowledge about mental illness
develops and is consolidated by interdisciplinary research, the disease becomes
more and more clearly defined.  As Professor Weihofen stated in Mental
Disorder as a Criminal Defense (1954), at p. 46:

 

Actually, it would in most cases be extremely difficult
for an imposter to mislead a competent psychiatrist... 

 

    The
ordinary malinger does not realize that the various forms of mental disorder
have their characteristic symptoms, and that displaying a hodge-podge of
symptoms will not only fail to convince, but will rather clearly reveal his
malingering.

 

    He
does, however, caution that in order to arrive at an accurate diagnosis of
malingering in difficult cases, some opportunity for examination and
observation by impartial experts should be put in place.  Nevertheless, we can
say as a general rule that, everything else being equal, as scientific
knowledge about mental illness increases the possibility of a successful
feigned insanity plea diminishes.

 

    Assuming
for the moment that the standard of proof on the accused is reduced to a purely
evidentiary burden, what is the burden on the prosecution?  Lamer C.J. has
characterized it at pp. 000 and 000 as the ""impossible burden ... of proving
an accused's sanity in order to secure a conviction"". (Emphasis
added.)

 

    As
already mentioned, I believe that the Chief Justice has overstated the burden
that would lie on the Crown in the absence of s. 16(4) .  If the plea of
insanity pursuant to s. 16 of the Code is viewed as a
defence or a justification or excuse, then the procedure set forth by Dickson
C.J. in R. v. Holmes, supra, would govern.  He said at p. 935:

 

    The
basic principle of the common law has been that the accused need not prove a
defence.  Once an accused raises the possibility that a defence exists, whether
by pointing to some fact in the Crown evidence or by leading defence evidence,
the Crown is required to disprove the defence beyond a reasonable doubt. 
The common law has not distinguished in this area between defences that
challenge the existence of a necessary element of the offence and those
defences that admit the mens rea and actus reus but
avoid criminal liability because of circumstances that excuse or justify the
conduct. [Emphasis added.] 

 

In the
absence of s. 16(4)  the onus would still be on the accused to adduce evidence
that makes insanity ""a live issue fit and proper to be left to the
jury"" (R. v. Gill (1963), 47 Cr. App. R. 166, at p.
172).  The burden on the Crown would then be to remove any doubt raised by the
accused in the jury's mind as to the presence of any of the elements of
insanity as set out in ss. 16(2)  and 16(3) .

 

    Chief
Justice Lamer acknowledges that the insanity defence is invoked infrequently
given the significant constraint on liberty that follows a successful plea. 
Nevertheless, he is of the view that it would be invoked more often if the
standard of proof were lowered to a purely evidentiary burden on the accused. 
There is no support for this proposition and the experience in the United
States seems to be to the contrary.  This is not surprising since a successful
insanity plea is not an open door to freedom.  It is a mandate for confinement
in an appropriate institution for treatment rather than confinement
simpliciter.  The mean length of time of LGW detentions is six years and four
months: see Hodgins et al., op. cit., Table 5.  Moreover, the principle already
stated that it is better that a guilty person be found not guilty by reason of
insanity and committed for psychiatric treatment than that an insane person be
convicted of a crime is, in my view, fully in keeping with both Charter  values
and the most basic tenets of our criminal justice system.

 

    For
these reasons, I am not persuaded that s. 16(4)  impairs the accused's right to
be presumed innocent as little as is reasonably possible.  Rather, I am of the
view that the government's objective could be quite readily met by imposing a
purely evidentiary burden on the accused.  The infringement on s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
resulting from s. 16(4)  is accordingly not saved by s. 1 .

 

    While
striking down s. 16(4)  may represent a substantial departure from our criminal
law tradition, I believe that it is necessitated by the expansive reading this
Court gave to s. 11 (d) of the Charter  in Whyte and by
the absence of any hard evidence to show that the provision constitutes a
reasonable and demonstrably justified limit under s. 1 .

 

    It
follows, of course, from the above analysis that the common law principle which
is reflected in s. 16(4)  also infringes s. 11 (d) and is
not saved by s. 1 .

 

Morally
or Legally Wrong: s. 16(2) 

 

    On
the issue of whether the word ""wrong"" in s. 16(2) of the Code should
be interpreted narrowly as meaning ""legally wrong"" or more broadly as
meaning ""morally wrong"", I agree with the Chief Justice that the word
is properly construed as ""morally wrong"".

 

Specific
Delusions: s. 16(3)

 

    On
the issue of ""specific delusions"" under s. 16(3) of the Code, while
I agree with the Chief Justice that most cases of specific delusions will now
be caught under the second branch of s. 16(2) , I am reluctant to adopt his
statement that ""there can be no doubt that any successful attempt to
invoke the insanity defence under s. 16(3) would also succeed under s.
16(2) "" (p. 000).  I am concerned that there may be ""specific
delusions"" which are not necessarily attributable to ""disease of the
mind"".  I note that in R. v. Abbey, [1982] 2 S.C.R.
24, this Court accepted (without comment) the trial judge's conclusion that the
specific delusion from which the accused was suffering in that case constituted
""disease of the mind"" within the meaning of s. 16(2) .  That case is
not, however, authority for the broader proposition that every specific
delusion necessarily stems from disease of the mind.  Since legislative
provisions should not readily be held to be redundant, particularly ones which
are favourable to the accused, I would prefer to leave s. 16(3) open to an
accused who might not qualify for the insanity defence under the second branch
of s. 16(2) .

 

Splitting
the Case

 

    I
agree with Lamer C.J. that no issue of the Crown splitting its case arises
here and that the evidence adduced to rebut the defence of insanity was
properly admitted by the trial judge.

 

Disposition

 

    I
would allow the appeal and order a new trial to be conducted on the basis of
the legal principles set out above.  I would answer the constitutional
questions set by Dickson C.J. as follows:

 

1.  Is
s. 16(4) of the Criminal Code  of Canada
inconsistent with s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Yes.

 

2.  If
the answer to question 1 is yes, is s. 16(4) justified by s. 1  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with
the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    No.

 

//McLachlin
J.//

 

    The
reasons of L'Heureux‑Dubé and McLachlin JJ. were delivered by

 

    McLachlin J.
(dissenting) ‑‑ This case raises fundamental questions
relating to the presumption of sanity in the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 . First, does the presumption of sanity offend the
presumption of innocence embodied in s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?  Second, how should the definition
of insanity in s. 16(2) of the Code be interpreted: 
when the Code speaks of ""knowing that an act
or omission is wrong"", does it mean legally ""wrong"" or morally
""wrong""?   I respectfully disagree with Lamer C.J. and Wilson J. on
each of these issues.

 

Is s.
16(4) of the Code inconsistent with
s. 11 (d) of the Charter ?

 

Construction
of s. 16 of the Criminal Code

 

    The
question posed is whether s. 16(4)  of the Criminal Code , which
provides that every one is presumed sane until the contrary is proved, is
invalid because it infringes the presumption of innocence found in s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

    The
problem can be approached in two different ways.  The first option is to treat
sanity for the purposes of analysis as relating to an essential element of a
criminal offence or to an exculpatory defence: Colvin, ""Exculpatory
Defences in Criminal Law"" (1990), 10 Oxford J. Legal Stud. 381,
at p. 394.  This approach inexorably leads, as the Chief Justice's reasons
demonstrate, to the conclusion that the presumption of sanity infringes
s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  The question
then becomes whether it is justified under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

    The
second option sees sanity as relevant, not to the essential elements of or
exculpatory defences to a criminal offence, but rather as the basic
pre-condition of criminal responsibility.  On this view, the question of sanity
relates not to guilt or innocence, but to the more fundamental issue of whether
the accused can fairly be held criminally responsible for his or her acts or
omissions.

 

    Professor
Alan Mewett identifies these alternate approaches to the problem in 
""Insanity, Criminal Law and the Charter "" (1989), 31 Crim. L.Q. 241. 
He states, at p. 241:

 

One
assumes that it will not be difficult to uphold the validity of [the
presumption of sanity] either by using s. 1  of the Charter , it being
impossible to prove sanity, or simply because the issue of insanity arises at a
tangent to the basic principles of criminal liability and does not affect the
prosecution's burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt everything that
constitutes guilt. 

 

    Lamer C.J.
takes the view that the presumption of sanity in s. 16(4)  violates the
presumption of innocence found in s. 11 (d) but
that, as Professor Mewett suggests, the provision is saved under s. 1  of
the Charter .  I, on the other hand, favour the alternative route
identified by Professor Mewett:  because the question of insanity ""arises
at a tangent to the basic principles of criminal liability"", the
presumption found in s. 16(4)  does not offend s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  In my
opinion, this approach best accords with the rationale underlying the insanity
provisions of our criminal law as well as the wording of s. 16  of the Criminal
Code .

 

    The
Underlying Rationale

 

    I
turn first to the rationale underlying the insanity provisions in the criminal
law.

 

    At
the heart of our criminal law system is the cardinal assumption that human
beings are rational and autonomous:  G. Ferguson, ""A Critique of
Proposals to Reform the Insanity Defence"" (1989), 14 Queen's L.
J. 135, at p. 140.  This is the fundamental condition upon which
criminal responsibility reposes.  Individuals have the capacity to reason right
from wrong, and thus to choose between right and wrong.  Ferguson continues (at
p. 140):

 

It is
these dual capacities -- reason and choice -- which give moral justification to
imposing criminal responsibility and punishment on offenders.  If a person can
reason right from wrong and has the ability to choose right or wrong, then
attribution of responsibility and punishment is morally justified or deserved
when that person consciously chooses wrong.

 

    The
requirement of moral blameworthiness for attribution of responsibility and
punishment dates back to the origins of western ethical and legal thought:  I.
Keilitz and J. P. Fulton, The Insanity Defense and its Alternatives: A Guide for
Policymakers (1984), at p. 5.  Aristotle, for example, reasoned
that capacity for choice was central to the issue of moral culpability:  J. M.
Quen, ""Anglo-American Concepts of Criminal Responsibility:  A Brief
History"", in S. J. Hucker, C. D. Webster, M. H. Ben-Aron, eds., Mental
Disorder and Criminal Responsibility (1981), 1, at p.
1.  Where a person lacks this capacity for choice because he or she is not
capable of knowing that his or her acts are wrong, the moral justification for
attribution of responsibility and punishment will be absent for, as Ferguson,
op. cit., observes at p. 140, ""It is immoral to punish those who do not
have the capacity to reason or to choose right from wrong"".

 

    The
long history of insanity provisions in Anglo-Canadian criminal law reflects
this fundamental nexus between capacity for rational choice and legal
blameworthiness.  In explaining the rationale underlying the present s. 16 
of the Criminal Code , the Law Reform Commission of Canada fastened on this
consideration (Working Paper 29, Criminal Law: The General Part --
Liability and Defences (1982), at p. 42):

 

[T]he
defence of insanity rests on the fundamental moral view that insane persons are
not responsible for their actions and are not therefore fit subjects for
punishment.

 

Parliament,
through s. 16 , has defined ""fitness for punishment"" in terms of
capacity for the knowledge of right and wrong rather than volitional impairment
(see Ferguson, op. cit., at p. 143).

 

    These
then are the historical and philosophical underpinnings of the universal notion
that insane persons should not be held criminally responsible for their acts
and omissions in the same way that sane persons are.  They reflect a
fundamental conviction that criminal responsibility is appropriate only where
the actor is a discerning moral agent, capable of making choices between right
and wrong. This is the fundamental pre-condition for imposition of criminal
liability.

 

    The
existence of sanity as the fundamental pre-condition of criminal responsibility
is not negated by the fact that insanity may also be seen as relevant to the
question of whether the essential elements of a criminal offence have been
established or whether an exculpatory defence is raised.   As Lamer C.J. points
out, insanity may be seen as negating the mens rea of the
offence or the presence of a voluntary, conscious act, required for the actus reus of the
offence:  see, for example, Rabey v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R.
513.  Similarly, insanity might be relevant to an exculpatory defence in the
nature of an excuse or justification, such as provocation or self-defence. But
it does not follow from the fact that insanity may be relevant to the elements
of a criminal offence or to defences, that it should be regarded as only
relevant to the essential elements of, or exculpatory defences to, criminal
offences, or that s. 16  of the Criminal Code  should
be read as focussing on them.   The fact that insanity might be relevant to
these matters does not preclude the notion honoured from Aristotle's time to
the present that the question of guilt or innocence arises only where the actor
is a sane, responsible agent capable of discerning right and wrong.

 

    This
point is made by Mewett and Manning, Criminal Law (2nd
ed. 1985), who specifically counsel against viewing the insanity provisions of
the Criminal Code  merely in terms of the essential elements of, or
exculpatory defences to, an offence (at pp. 254-55):

 

    A
problem arises if one attempts to fit insanity into the confining limits of actus reus and mens rea.  While
insanity may negative either actus reus or mens rea, it is
suggested that this fact is merely incidental to the scope of the issue which,
put shortly, states that whether or not the actus reus and mens rea are
affected, a person within s. 16  is entitled to be acquitted.

The Language of s. 16 

 

    Having
established that the underlying rationale of our insanity provisions is the
broad concept that criminal responsibility should be confined to persons
capable of discerning between right and wrong, I turn to s. 16 of the Code
itself.  In my view, an examination of the wording and functioning of s. 16 
confirms that it should be read as relating to this fundamental pre-condition
for the assignment of criminal responsibility rather than to the elements of an
offence or to particular defences.

 

    The
language of the Code makes it clear that s. 16  is
concerned only with capacity for criminal responsibility.  Section 16(2) 
provides that a person is insane when, due to disease of the mind, the person
is incapable of appreciating the nature or quality of an act or omission
or of knowing that an act or omission is wrong.  As Mewett and Manning point
out at p. 234, the proper inquiry is thus not into what the accused actually
appreciated but, rather, into what the accused's capacity was.

 

[I]n
insanity the ultimate question is the accused's capacity -- it is not
concerned with what he actually appreciated and is thus not concerned with
actual mens rea or actual actus reus.  Insanity is a
defence because it affects the capacity of the accused.

 

    By
contrast, insanity as it relates to the essential elements of an offence or
defences to it, on the other hand, is concerned not with capacity, but with the
actual state of mind of the accused.   To focus on insanity as somehow denying
an essential element of the offence or establishing a defence is to fail to
appreciate the proper operation of the insanity provisions found in s. 16
of the Code.  It confounds the question of capacity for criminal
responsibility with the quite different question of what the accused actually
appreciated.

 

    It
is true, of course, that an accused who does not have the capacity to
appreciate something cannot have appreciated it; the point, however, is that
the insanity inquiry never looks beyond capacity to actual mens rea or actus reus.  For
practical purposes, where insanity becomes an issue at trial, there will be
objective evidence from which, absent the claim of insanity under s. 16 of the Code, the
trier of fact will be justified in inferring the existence of the essential
elements of the offence, i.e. the actus reus and mens rea.  The
claim of insanity, however, pre-empts the traditional inference-drawing process
on the ground that a person without the capacity for choice as defined in s. 16

    Applicants,
whose murder convictions were upheld on appeal, sought leave to appeal to this
Court pursuant to s. 618(1) (b) of the Criminal Code .  After
filing the application for leave to appeal, counsel for applicant Morrissette
argued that, under the newly adopted s. 45 of the Supreme Court Act, the
Court did not have jurisdiction to decide the application without according
applicant an oral hearing.

 

    Held:  The
application is dismissed.

 

    The
Court held that it had jurisdiction to determine the application on the basis
of the written material and without according an oral hearing.  It is important
to distinguish (1) grounds for appeal from (2) procedure to be followed and the
criteria to be applied in deciding whether to grant leave to appeal.  The right
to appeal to this Court from a judgment dismissing an appeal from a conviction
for an indictable offence is conferred by the Criminal Code  and not
by the Supreme Court Act.  Section 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act relates
only to the grounds for appeal and, even when read with s. 45, bears no
relation to the procedure to be followed or to the criteria to be applied when
the Court is deciding whether or not to grant leave.  Section 45 was intended by
Parliament to establish a procedure of general application and to afford this
Court the authority to control its own docket.  Hence s. 45, in its present
form, should be interpreted in that light.

//The Court//

 

    The
following is the judgment delivered by

 

    THE COURT -- The
issue to be addressed on this application is whether the Court has jurisdiction
to decide, on the basis of written materials and without an oral hearing, an
application for leave to appeal from a judgment of a court of appeal affirming
a conviction for an indictable offence.  

 

I  Statutory
Provisions

 

    For
ease of reference, the relevant statutory provisions may be set out here:

 

Supreme
Court Act

 

    41.  (1) Subject to subsection (3), an
appeal lies to the Supreme Court from any final or other judgment of the
highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which
judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme
Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by
any other court, where, with respect to the particular case sought to be appealed,
the Supreme Court is of the opinion that any question involved therein is, by
reason of its public importance or the importance of any issue of law or any
issue of mixed law and fact involved in such question, one that ought to be
decided by the Supreme Court or is, for any other reason, of such a nature or
significance as to warrant decision by it, and leave to appeal from such
judgment is accordingly granted by the Supreme Court.

 

    (2) An application for leave to appeal under this
section shall be brought in accordance with paragraph 64(1)(a).

 

    (3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this
section from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting
aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or,
except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other
than an indictable offence.

 

    45.  (1) Notwithstanding any other Act
of Parliament, an application the Supreme Court for leave to appeal shall be
made to the Court in writing and the Court shall

 

(a) grant the application if it is clear from the written
material that the application comes within the provisions of section 41 and
does not warrant an oral hearing;

 

(b) dismiss the application if it is clear from the
written material that the application does not come within the provisions of
section 41 and does not warrant an oral hearing; and

 

(c) order an oral hearing to determine the application, in
any other case.

 

Criminal
Code 

 

618.  (1) A person who is convicted of an indictable
offence and whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to
the Supreme Court of Canada

 

(a) on any question of law on which a judge of the court
of appeal dissents, or

 

(b) on any question of law, if leave to appeal is granted
by the Supreme Court of Canada within twenty-one days after the judgment
appealed from is pronounced or within such extended time as the Supreme Court
of Canada or a judge thereof may, for special reasons, allow.

 

II  Facts

 

    The
applicants were convicted of first degree murder and their appeals to the
Manitoba Court of Appeal were dismissed.  They now seek leave to appeal to this
Court pursuant to s. 618(1) (b) of the Criminal Code .  Upon
filing the application for leave to appeal, counsel for the applicant
Morrissette indicated that he took the position that the Court did not have
jurisdiction to decide the application for leave to appeal without according
him an oral hearing.  A hearing was ordered to determine the jurisdictional
point, and by order of the Court, notice was given to the Attorney General of
Canada and to the provincial Attorneys General of the motion challenging the
Court's jurisdiction.  The Attorney General of Canada intervened, making both
written and oral submissions.  At the conclusion of the argument on the
jurisdictional issue, the Court gave judgment holding that it did have
jurisdiction to determine the application on the basis of the written material
and without according an oral hearing and indicated that reasons would follow. 
The Court also held, however, that in the circumstances, a panel of three
judges would hear oral submissions on the application for leave to appeal
itself.  These reasons deal solely with the question of the Court's
jurisdiction.

 

III  Submission
of the Applicant

 

    The
applicant contends that a literal reading of ss. 41 and 45 of the Supreme
Court Act leads to the conclusion that the Court cannot dispose
of an application for leave to appeal without an oral hearing where, as in the
case at bar, the right to seek leave is conferred by s. 618(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code .  This argument is based upon s. 41(3) of the Supreme
Court Act which expressly provides that no appeal lies to the
Supreme Court of Canada ""under this section"" from the judgment of a
court affirming a conviction for an indictable offence.  The applicant contends
that s. 45 expressly exempts cases which fall within s. 41(3) from the
procedure whereby the Court has jurisdiction to dispose of an application for
leave to appeal on the basis of written materials and without according an oral
hearing.  Section 45(1)(a) provides that the Court shall grant the application
for leave to appeal where ""it is clear . . . that the application comes
within the provisions of section 41 . . ."" and s. 45(1)(b)
provides that the Court shall dismiss the application where ""it is clear .
. . that the application does not come within the provisions of section 41 . .
."".  As appeals from conviction for an indictable offence are expressly
excluded from s. 41 by virtue of s. 41(3), it will always be clear that the
application does not come within s. 41, and the applicant therefore submits
that the procedure contemplated by s. 45 can have no application to him.

 

IV   Analysis

 

    It
is our view that the applicant's argument is unpersuasive and that a careful
analysis of the relevant statutory provisions leads to the conclusion that the
Court does indeed have jurisdiction pursuant to s. 45 to determine the
application for leave to appeal without affording the applicant an oral
hearing. 

 

    We
do not believe that the approach to interpretation relied upon by the applicant
yields the conclusion he urges upon the Court.  As counsel for the Attorney
General of Canada contended, a strictly literal approach taken to its logical
conclusion would produce a highly implausible, indeed absurd result, namely,
that the Court could not grant leave without an oral hearing under s. 45(1)(a), but
it could refuse leave without a hearing pursuant to s. 45(1)(b).  The
latter subsection provides that an application is to be dismissed where it is
clear from the written materials that it does not come within the provisions of
s. 41.  The applicant contends that he does not fall within s. 41 and hence,
the reference to s. 41 in s. 45(1)(b) would create no
impediment to the Court's dismissing the application on the basis of the
written material alone.  On the other hand, the Court could not grant the
application without a hearing, as s. 45(1)(a) only
applies to applications coming within s. 41.  Parliament could not possibly
have intended to require an oral hearing where the Court considers it
appropriate to grant the application, but not where the Court decides to
dismiss it.  A reading of the statute which would distinguish between
applications to be granted and applications to be dismissed for procedural
purposes should surely be avoided, particularly where the result would be to
accord greater procedural rights where the application is to be allowed than
where it is to be denied.  An intention to produce an unreasonable result
should not be imputed to a statute, particularly where another interpretation
is available.

 

    To
come to a proper understanding of the interaction between ss. 41 and 45 of the Supreme
Court Act, it is important to distinguish (1) grounds for appeal
from (2) procedure to be followed and the criteria to be applied in deciding
whether to grant leave to appeal.  The right to appeal to this Court from a
judgment dismissing an appeal from a conviction for an indictable offence is
conferred by the Criminal Code  and not by the Supreme
Court Act:  hence, s. 41(3) which makes it clear that the grounds
for an appeal in such a case must be those prescribed by the Criminal
Code  and not by s. 41(1) .  Section 618  of the Criminal
Code  restricts appeals from conviction for an indictable
offence to questions of law.  Sections 620  and 621  of the Criminal
Code  impose similar restrictions on appeals from a verdict
of insanity, unfitness to stand trial, and appeals by the Attorneys General. 
The effect of s. 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act is to
make it clear that resort cannot be had to the broader grounds for appeal
conferred by s. 41(1), according a right of appeal not only on a question of
law, but as well on issues of mixed law and fact.  In our view, s. 41(3)
relates solely to the grounds for appeal and, even when read with s. 45, bears
no relation to the procedure to be followed or to the criteria to be applied
when the Court is deciding whether or not to grant leave.  When s. 45(1) asks
whether the case ""comes within the provisions of section 41"" (s.
45(1)(a)) or ""does not come within the provisions of
section 41"" (s. 45(1)(b)), the question concerns the legal standard prescribed
by s. 41(1), in other words, whether or not the case is, by reason of its
public importance or the importance of any issue of law, one that ought to be
decided by the Supreme Court.

 

    Section
45 was intended by Parliament to provide for uniform and universally applicable
procedure for the determination of applications for leave to appeal, a
conclusion supported by the opening words of the section which indicate that it
is to apply notwithstanding any other act of Parliament; nothing in s. 41(3)
undermines that basic purpose.  The French version of s. 45(1)(a) and (b), which
reads as follows, supports this position:

 

    45. (1) Par dérogation à toute autre loi
fédérale, toute demande d'autorisation d'appel est présentée par écrit à la
Cour qui, selon le cas:

 

a) l'accueille si sa conformité avec l'article 41

d'une audience;

 

b) la rejette si sa non-conformité avec l'article 41
ressort des conclusions écrites et si elle ne justifie pas la tenue d'une
audience; [Emphasis added.]

 

In our
view, the use of the word ""conformité"" in the French version is
indicative of Parliament's intention that all leave applications should be made
in writing so that the Court may determine the ""compliance"" or
""non-compliance"" of the arguments with the standards set in s. 41(1).

 

    The
statutory history of ss. 41 and 45 lends strong support to the conclusion that
the purpose of s. 45 is to establish a procedure of general application.  As
noted in the factum of the applicant, s. 45 was first enacted in 1956 and
""was obviously intended as a comprehensive procedural measure, affecting
all applications for leave brought under all statutes, including the Criminal
Code .""  The amended version of s. 45 now in force
retains the character of its precursor as a comprehensive scheme establishing
the procedure to be followed in relation to all applications for leave to
appeal.  Indeed, amendments to the Supreme Court Act since
s. 45 was first enacted have transformed the jurisdiction.  Formerly, our
caseload was predominantly comprised of appeals as of right; now it is
predominantly appeals by leave.  As was stated in R. v. Gardiner, [1982]
2 S.C.R. 368, at p. 393, ""It is difficult to overestimate the significance
of this transition.""  Parliament has chosen to afford this Court the
authority to control its own docket and s. 45, in its present form, should be
interpreted in that light.  While the 1987 amendments (of which the present s.
45 forms a part) did not eliminate all appeals as of right, they did further
enhance the capacity of this Court to manage its docket by conferring
jurisdiction to decide leave applications on the basis of written material. 
Had Parliament intended to limit this important newly-conferred jurisdiction by
excepting applications for leave in certain criminal cases, it would have said
so explicitly.  This Court has recently affirmed the desirability of ""an
expansive reading"" of the provisions relating to leave to appeal ""the
better to enable this Court to discharge its role at the apex of the Canadian
judicial system as the court of last resort for all Canadians"":  Argentina
v. Mellino, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 536 at p. 547, quoting R. v.
Gardiner, supra, at p. 404.  The result of the
foregoing analysis is entirely consistent with this approach and in keeping
with the important objective of enhancing this Court's capacity to control and
manage its docket in a manner consistent with its role at the apex of the
Canadian judicial hierarchy.

 

V  Conclusion

 

    For
these reasons, we conclude that the applicant's claim to an oral hearing as of
right and challenge to the Court's jurisdiction to decide his application for
leave to appeal without according him an oral hearing must fail.

on
appeal from the court of appeal for saskatchewan

 

    Appeal
-- Mootness -- Abortion provisions of Criminal Code ‑‑ Provisions
under challenge already found invalid -- Ancillary questions relating to
Charter rights of the foetus -- Whether or not issue moot ‑‑ Whether
or not Court should exercise discretion to hear case -- Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, s. 251 -- Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , ss. 7 , 15 .

 

    Criminal
law -- Abortion -- Provisions under challenge already found invalid --
Ancillary questions relating to Charter rights of the foetus ‑‑ Whether
or not issue moot -- Whether or not Court should exercise discretion to hear
case.

 

    Constitutional
law -- Charter of Rights  -- Right to life, liberty and security of the person
-- Right to equality before and under the law ‑‑ Whether or
not Charter rights extending to foetus -- Charter issues ancillary to question
of validity of abortion provisions of Criminal Code ‑‑ Provisions
under challenge already found invalid -- Whether or not issue moot -- Whether
or not Court should exercise discretion to hear case.

 

    Civil
procedure -- Standing -- Standing originally found because action seeking
declaration as to legislation's validity -- Provisions under challenge already
found invalid -- Whether or not standing as originally determined -- Whether or
not s. 24(1) of the Charter and s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 able to
support claim for standing.

 

    Appellant
attacked the validity of s. 251(4) , (5)  and (6)  of the Criminal
Code  relating to abortion on the ground that they
contravened the life and security and the equality rights of the foetus, as a
person, protected by ss. 7  and 15  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms .  Appellant's standing had been found on the basis that
he was seeking a declaration that legislation is invalid, that there was a
serious issue as to its invalidity, that he had a genuine interest as a citizen
in the validity of the legislation and that there was no other reasonable and
effective manner in which the issue could be brought before the Court.

 

    The
Court of Queen's Bench found s. 251(4) , (5)  and (6)  did not violate the Charter  as a
foetus was not protected by either s. 7  or s. 15  of the Charter  and
also held that the s. 1  of Canadian Bill of Rights did not give the
courts the right to assess the substantive content or wisdom of legislation. 
The Court of Appeal concluded that neither s. 7  nor s. 15  of the Charter  applied
to a foetus.  The constitutional questions stated in this Court queried:  (1)
if a foetus had the right to life as guaranteed by s. 7  of the Charter ; (2) if
so, whether s. 251(4) , (5)  and (6)  of the Criminal Code 
violated the principles of fundamental justice contrary to s. 7  of the Charter ; (3)
whether a foetus had the right to equal protection and equal benefit of the law
without discrimination because of age or mental or physical disability as
guaranteed by s. 15  of the Charter ; (4) if so, whether s. 251(4) , (5) 
and (6)  of the Criminal Code  violated s. 15 ;
and (5) if questions (2) and (4) were answered affirmatively, whether s.
251(4) , (5)  and (6)  of the Criminal Code  were justified by
s. 1  of the Charter .  All of s. 251 , however, was struck
down subsequent to the Court of Appeal's decision but before the appeal reached
this Court as a result of this Court's decision in R. v. Morgentaler
(No. 2).

 

    A
serious issue existed at the commencement of the appeal as to whether the
appeal was moot.  Questions also existed as to whether the appellant had lost
his standing and, indeed, whether the matter was justiciable.  These issues
were addressed as a preliminary matter and decision on them was reserved.  The
Court then heard argument on the merits of the appeal so that the whole appeal
could be decided without recalling the parties for argument should it decide
that the appeal should proceed notwithstanding the preliminary issues.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

    The
appeal is moot and the Court should not exercise its discretion to hear it. 
Moreover, appellant no longer has standing to pursue the appeal as the
circumstances upon which his standing was originally premised have disappeared.

 

    The
doctrine of mootness is part of a general policy that a court may decline to
decide a case which raises merely a hypothetical or abstract question.  An
appeal is moot when a decision will not have the effect of resolving some
controversy affecting or potentially affecting the rights of the parties.  Such
a live controversy must be present not only when the action or proceeding is
commenced but also when the court is called upon to reach a decision.  The
general policy is enforced in moot cases unless the court exercises its
discretion to depart from it.

 

    The
approach with respect to mootness involves a two-step analysis.  It is first
necessary to determine whether the requisite tangible and concrete dispute has
disappeared rendering the issues academic.  If so, it is then necessary to
decide if the court should exercise its discretion to hear the case. (In the
interest of clarity, a case is moot if it does not present a concrete
controversy even though a court may elect to address the moot issue.)

 

    This
appeal is moot as there is no longer a concrete legal dispute.  The live
controversy underlying this appeal -- the challenge to the constitutionality of
s. 251(4) , (5)  and (6)  of the Criminal Code  --
disappeared when s. 251  was struck down in R. v. Morgentaler
(No. 2).  None of the relief sought in the statement of claim
was relevant.  Three of the five constitutional questions that were set
explicitly concerned s. 251  and were no longer applicable.  The remaining
two questions addressed the scope of ss. 7  and 15  of the Charter  and
were not severable from the context of the original challenge to s. 251 .

 

    A
constitutional question cannot bind this Court and may not be used to transform
an appeal into a reference.  Constitutional questions are stated to define with
precision the constitutional points at issue, not to introduce new issues, and
accordingly, cannot be used as an independent basis for supporting an otherwise
moot appeal.

 

    The
second stage in the analysis requires that a court consider whether it should
exercise its discretion to decide the merits of the case, despite the absence
of a live controversy.  Courts may be guided in the exercise of their
discretion by considering the underlying rationale of the mootness doctrine.

 

    The
first rationale for the policy with respect to mootness in that a court's
competence to resolve legal disputes is rooted in the adversary system.  A full
adversarial context, in which both parties have a full stake in the outcome, is
fundamental to our legal system.  The second is based on the concern for
judicial economy which requires that a court examine the circumstances of a
case to determine if it is worthwhile to allocate scarce judicial resources to
resolve the moot issue.  The third underlying rationale of the mootness
doctrine is the need for courts to be sensitive to the effectiveness or
efficacy of judicial intervention and demonstrate a measure of awareness of the
judiciary's role in our political framework.  The Court, in exercising its
discretion in an appeal which is moot, should consider the extent to which each
of these three basic factors is present.  The process is not mechanical.  The
principles may not all support the same conclusion and the presence of one or
two of the factors may be overborne by the absence of the third, and vice
versa.

 

    The
Court should decline to exercise its discretion to decide this appeal on its
merits because of concerns for judicial economy and for the Court's role in the
law-making process.  The absence of an adversarial relationship was of little
concern:  the appeal was argued as fully as if it were not moot.

 

    With
respect to judicial economy, none of the factors justifying the application of
judicial resources applied.  The decision would not have practical side effects
on the rights of the parties.  The case was not one that was capable of
repetition, yet evasive of review:  it will almost certainly be brought before
the Court within a specific legislative context or possibly in review of specific
governmental action.  An abstract pronouncement on foetal rights here would not
necessarily obviate future repetitious litigation.  It was not in the public
interest, notwithstanding the great public importance of the question involved,
to address the merits in order to settle the state of the law.  A decision as
to whether ss. 7  and 15  of the Charter  protect the rights
of the foetus is not in the public interest due to the potential uncertainty
that could result from such a decision absent a legislative context.

 

    A
proper awareness of the Court's law-making function dictated against the
Court's exercising its discretion to decide this appeal.  The question posed
here was not the question raised in the original action.  Indeed, what was
sought -- a Charter  interpretation in the absence of
legislation or other governmental action bringing it into play -- would turn
this appeal into a private reference.  The Court, if it were to exercise its
discretion, would intrude on the right of the executive to order a reference
and pre-empt a possible decision of Parliament by dictating the form of
legislation it should enact.  To do so would be a marked departure from the
Court's traditional role.

 

    The
appellant also lacked standing to pursue this appeal given the fact that the
original basis for his standing no longer existed.  Two significant changes in
the nature of this action occurred since standing was granted by this Court in
1981.  Firstly, the claim is now premised primarily upon an alleged right of a
foetus to life and equality pursuant to ss. 7  and 15  of the Charter . 
Secondly, the legislative context of original claim disappeared when s. 251  of
the Criminal Code  was struck down.  Standing could not be based on s.
24(1)  of the Charter  for an infringement or denial of a
person's own Charter -based right was required.  Here, the
rights allegedly violated were those of a foetus.  Standing could not be based
on s. 52(1)  of the Constitution Act, 1982  as this is
restricted to litigants challenging a law or governmental action pursuant to
power granted by law.

    The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

    SOPINKA J. --
This appeal by leave of this Court is from the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal,
[1987] 4 W.W.R. 385, which affirmed the judgment at trial of Matheson J.
of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench, [1984] 1 W.W.R. 15, dismissing the
action of the plaintiff (appellant in this Court).  In the courts below, the
plaintiff attacked the validity of subss. (4), (5) and (6) of s. 251 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, relating to abortion on the
ground that they contravened protected rights of the foetus.  Subsequent to the
decision of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal but by the time the appeal reached
this Court, s. 251, including the subsections under attack in this action, had
been struck down in R. v. Morgentaler, [1988] 1 S.C.R.
30 (hereinafter R. v. Morgentaler (No. 2)).

 

    From
this state of the proceedings it was apparent at the commencement of this
appeal that a serious issue existed as to whether the appeal was moot.  As
well, it appeared questionable whether the appellant had lost his standing and,
indeed, whether the matter was justiciable.  The Court therefore called upon
counsel to address these issues as a preliminary matter.  Upon completion of
these submissions, we reserved decision on these issues and heard the argument
of the merits of the appeal so that we could dispose of the whole appeal
without recalling the parties for argument should we decide that,
notwithstanding the preliminary issues, the appeal should proceed.

 

    In
view of the conclusion that I have reached, it is necessary to deal with the
issues of mootness and standing only.  Since it is a change in the nature of
these proceedings which gives rise to these issues, a review of the history of
the action is necessary.

 

History
of the Action

 

    Mr.
Borowski commenced an action in the Court of Queen's Bench of Saskatchewan by
filing a statement of claim on September 5, 1978, which asked for the following
relief:

 

    (a)An Order of this Honourable Court declaring
section 251, subsections (4), (5) and (6) of the Criminal Code  invalid
and inoperative;

 

    (b)An Order of this Honourable Court declaring that
the provisions of all Acts of the Parliament of Canada, and all legal
instruments purporting to authorize the expenditure of public moneys for any of
the purposes described in section 251, subsections (4), (5) and (6) are invalid
and inoperative, and the outlay of such moneys is ultra vires and
unlawful;

 

    (c)A permanent injunction enjoining the Minister of
Finance, his servants and agents, from allocating, disbursing or in any way
providing public moneys out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the
establishment or maintenance of therapeutic abortion committees, for the
performance of abortions or in support of any act or object relating to the
abortion and destruction of individual human foetuses;

 

    (d)The costs of this action; and

 

    (e)Such
further and other relief as to this Honourable Court seems just and expedient.

 

    Prior
to trial, a motion was brought by the respondents questioning the jurisdiction
of the Court of Queen's Bench.  That motion culminated in an appeal to this
Court in which a central issue was Mr. Borowski's standing to bring the
action.  The resulting decision of the majority of this Court, reported in Minister
of Justice of Canada v. Borowski, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 575, was that Mr.
Borowski had standing to attack the provisions of the Code
referred to in his statement of claim.  Martland J., speaking for the majority,
stated, at p. 598:

 

    I
interpret these cases as deciding that to establish status as a plaintiff in a
suit seeking a declaration that legislation is invalid, if there is a serious
issue as to its invalidity, a person need only to show that he is affected by
it directly or that he has a genuine interest as a citizen in the validity of
the legislation and that there is no other reasonable and effective manner in
which the issue may be brought before the Court.  In my opinion, the respondent
has met this test and should be permitted to proceed with his action.

 

    Laskin
C.J., with whom Lamer J. concurred, would have denied standing on the basis
that Mr. Borowski was not a person affected by the legislation and that there
were others, such as doctors and hospitals, who might be so affected.  The
Chief Justice concluded, therefore, that Mr. Borowski did not have any
judicially cognizable interest in the matter and that the Court ought to
exercise its discretion to deny standing.

 

    An
amended statement of claim was filed on April 18, 1983, in which the original
claims based on an alleged violation of the Canadian Bill of
Rights, R.S.C. 1970, App. III, were repeated.  Allegations
based upon the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , which
had been proclaimed on April 17, 1982, were added.  The prayer for relief
claimed:

 

    (a)An Order of this Honourable Court declaring
Subsections (4), (5) and (6) of Section 251  of the Criminal Code  to be ultra
vires, unconstitutional, invalid, inoperative and of no force
or effect;

 

    (b)An Order of this Honourable Court declaring that
the provisions of all Acts of the Parliament of Canada, and all legal
instruments purporting to authorize the expenditure of public moneys for any of
the purposes described in Subsections (4), (5) and (6) of Section 251  of the Criminal
Code  are ultra vires, inoperative,
unconstitutional, invalid and of no force or effect and the outlay of such
moneys is unlawful:

 

    (c)The costs of this action; and

 

    (d)Such
further and other relief as to this Honourable Court seems just.

 

    The
Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench dismissed Mr. Borowski's claim relating to
an alleged violation of s. 1 of the Canadian Bill of Rights. 
Matheson J. held that both Morgentaler v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R.
616 (hereinafter Morgentaler v. The Queen (No. 1)) and Dehler v.
Ottawa Civic Hospital (1980), 29 O.R. (2d) 677 (C.A.) (leave to appeal to
S.C.C. refused [1981] 1 S.C.R. viii) concluded that the Canadian
Bill of Rights did not give the courts the right to assess the
substantive content or wisdom of legislation.

 

    Matheson
J. noted that Mr. Borowski's principal argument under the Charter  was
that the foetus is a person and therefore should be afforded the protection of
s. 7  of the Charter .  It was held, however, that s.
251(4) , (5) , and (6)  did not violate the Charter  as a
foetus is not included in ""everyone"" so as to trigger the application
of any s. 7  rights.

 

    On
appeal Mr. Borowski did not pursue his claim that government funding of
abortions was unlawful.  The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal dismissed Mr.
Borowski's appeal by concluding that neither s. 7  nor s. 15  (which had come
into effect on April 17, 1985, prior to the hearing before the Court of Appeal)
applied to a foetus.  Speaking for the Court, Gerwing J.A. examined the
historical treatment of the foetus as well as the language and legislative
history of s. 7  and concluded that the guarantees of s. 7  were not intended to
extend to the unborn.  As well, the foetus was held not to be included in
""every individual"" for the purpose of s. 15 .

 

    Leave
to appeal to this Court was granted on September 3, 1987.  The grounds for
appeal alleged by the appellant in his notice of motion for leave to appeal
refer primarily to ss. 7  and 15  of the Charter .  On
October 7, 1987, McIntyre J., pursuant to Rule 32 of the Rules of
the Supreme Court of Canada, SOR/83-74, stated the following constitutional
questions:

 

1.  Does a child en ventre sa mère have
the right to life as guaranteed by Section 7  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.  If the answer to question 1 is ""yes"", do
subsections (4), (5) and (6) of Section 251  of the Criminal Code  violate
or deny the principles of fundamental justice, contrary to Section 7  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

3.  Does a child en ventre sa mère have
the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without
discrimination because of age or mental or physical disability that are
guaranteed by Section 15  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

4.  If the answer to question 3 is ""yes"", do
subsections (4), (5) and (6) of Section 251  of the Criminal Code  violate
or deny the rights guaranteed by Section 15 ?

 

5.  If
the answer to question 2 is ""yes"" or if the answer to question 4 is
""yes"", are the provisions of subsections (4), (5) and (6) of Section
251  of the Criminal Code  justified by
Section 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and
therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

    On
January 28, 1988, after leave to appeal was granted, this Court decided R. v.
Morgentaler (No. 2), supra, in which all of s. 251 was found to
violate s. 7  of the Charter .  Accordingly, s. 251 in its entirety
was struck down.

 

    In
July of 1988 in light of this Court's judgment in R. v.  Morgentaler
(No. 2), supra, counsel on behalf of the Attorney
General of Canada applied to adjourn the hearing of the appeal.  The respondent
argued that the issue was now moot as s. 251  of the Criminal Code  had
been nullified and that the two remaining constitutional questions (numbers 1
and 3) which simply ask whether a child en ventre sa mère is
entitled to the protection of ss. 7  and 15  of the Charter 
respectively are not severable from the other, now moot constitutional
questions.  Although the respondent claimed the matter was moot, no application
to quash the appeal was made.  The application to adjourn the hearing of the
appeal was denied by Chief Justice Dickson on July 19, 1988, leaving it to the
Court to address the mootness issue.

 

    I am
of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed on the grounds that:  (1)
Mr. Borowski's case has been rendered moot and (2) he has lost his standing. 
When section 251 was struck down, the basis of the action disappeared.  The
initial prayer for relief was no longer applicable.  The foundation for
standing upon which the previous decision of this Court was based also
disappeared.

 

Mootness

 

    The
doctrine of mootness is an aspect of a general policy or practice that a court
may decline to decide a case which raises merely a hypothetical or abstract
question.  The general principle applies when the decision of the court will
not have the effect of resolving some controversy which affects or may affect
the rights of the parties.  If the decision of the court will have no practical
effect on such rights, the court will decline to decide the case.  This
essential ingredient must be present not only when the action or proceeding is
commenced but at the time when the court is called upon to reach a decision. 
Accordingly if, subsequent to the initiation of the action or proceeding,
events occur which affect the relationship of the parties so that no present
live controversy exists which affects the rights of the parties, the case is
said to be moot.  The general policy or practice is enforced in moot cases
unless the court exercises its discretion to depart from its policy or
practice.  The relevant factors relating to the exercise of the court's
discretion are discussed hereinafter.

 

    The
approach in recent cases involves a two-step analysis.  First it is necessary
to determine whether the required tangible and concrete dispute has disappeared
and the issues have become academic.  Second, if the response to the first
question is affirmative, it is necessary to decide if the court should exercise
its discretion to hear the case.  The cases do not always make it clear whether
the term ""moot"" applies to cases that do not present a concrete
controversy or whether the term applies only to such of those cases as the
court declines to hear.  In the interest of clarity, I consider that a case is
moot if it fails to meet the ""live controversy"" test.  A court may
nonetheless elect to address a moot issue if the circumstances warrant.

 

When is
an Appeal Moot? -- The Authorities

 

    The
first stage in the analysis requires a consideration of whether there remains a
live controversy.  The controversy may disappear rendering an  issue moot due
to a variety of reasons, some of which are discussed below.

 

    In The King
ex rel. Tolfree v. Clark, [1944] S.C.R. 69, this Court refused to grant leave to
appeal to applicants seeking a judgment excluding the respondents from sitting
and exercising their functions as Members of the Ontario Legislative Assembly. 
However, the Legislative Assembly had been dissolved prior to the hearing
before this Court.  As a result, Duff C.J., on behalf of the Court, held at p.
72:

 

    It
is one of those cases where, the state of facts to which the proceedings in the
lower Courts related and upon which they were founded having ceased to exist, the
sub-stratum of the litigation has disappeared.  In accordance with
well-settled principle, therefore, the appeal could not properly be
entertained.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    A
challenged municipal by-law was repealed prior to a hearing in Moir v.
The Corporation of the Village of Huntingdon (1891), 19 S.C.R.
363, leading to a conclusion that the appealing party had no actual interest
and that a decision could have no effect on the parties except as to costs. 
Similarly, in a fact situation analogous to this appeal, the Privy Council
refused to address the constitutionality of challenged legislation where two
statutes in question were repealed prior to the hearing: 
Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney- General for Canada, [1939]
A.C. 117 (P.C.)

 

    Appeals
have not been entertained in situations in which the appellant had agreed to an
undertaking to pay the respondent the damages awarded in the court below plus
costs regardless of the disposition of the appeal:  Coca-Cola Company of
Canada Ltd. v. Mathews, [1944] S.C.R. 385, and Sun Life Assurance
Company of Canada v. Jervis, [1944] A.C. 111.  In Coca-Cola v. Mathews,
Rinfret C.J. held the result of the undertaking was to eliminate any further lis between
the parties such that the Court would have been forced to decide an abstract
proposition of law.

 

    As
well, the sale of a restaurant for which a renewal of a licence was sought as
required by the impugned municipal by-law rendered an issue technically moot:  Vic
Restaurant Inc. v. City of Montreal, [1959] S.C.R.
58.  Issues in contention may be of a short duration resulting in an absence of
a live controversy by the time of appellate review.  Such a situation arose in
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local Union 2085 v. Winnipeg
Builders' Exchange, [1967] S.C.R. 628, in which the cessation of a strike
between the parties ended the actual dispute over the validity of an injunction
prohibiting certain strike action by one party.

 

    The particular
circumstances of the parties to an action may also eliminate the tangible
nature of a dispute.  The death of parties challenging the validity of a parole
revocation hearing (Re Cadeddu and The Queen (1983), 41 O.R.
(2d) 481 (C.A.)) and a speeding ticket (R. v. Mercure, [1988]
1 S.C.R. 234) ended any concrete controversy between the parties.

 

    As
well, the inapplicability of a statute to the party challenging the legislation
renders a dispute moot:  Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [1984]
1 S.C.R. 357.  This is similar to those situations in which an appeal from a
criminal conviction is seen as moot where the accused has fulfilled his
sentence prior to an appeal:  Re Maltby v. Attorney-General of Saskatchewan (1984),
10 D.L.R. (4th) 745 (Sask. C.A.)

 

    The
issue of mootness has arisen more frequently in American jurisprudence, and
there, the doctrine is more fully developed.  This may be due in part to the
constitutional requirement, contained in s. 2(1) of Article III of the American
Constitution, that there exist a ""case or controversy"":

 

    Section
2.  [1]  The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity,
arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties
made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;--to all Cases affecting
Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;--to all Cases of admiralty and
maritime Jurisdiction;--to Controversies to which the United States shall be a
Party;--to Controversies between two or more States;--between a State and
Citizens of another State;--between Citizens of different States;--between
Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and
between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or
Subjects.

 

However,
despite the constitutional enshrinement of the principle, the mootness doctrine
has its roots in common law principles similar to those in Canada:  see
""The Mootness Doctrine in the Supreme Court"" (1974), 88 Harvard
L.R. 373, at p. 374.  Situations resulting in a finding of
mootness are similar to those in Canada.  For example, in Hall v.
Beals, 396 U.S. 45 (1969), a challenge to a Colorado voter
residency requirement of six months was held moot due to a legislative change
in the law removing the plaintiff from the application of the statute. 
Mootness was also raised in United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345
U.S. 629 (1953), where a defendant voluntarily ceased allegedly unlawful
conduct.  Similarly, in Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40
(1968), mootness was an issue where an accused completed his sentence prior to
an appeal of his conviction.

 

    The
American jurisprudence indicates a similar willingness to consider the merits
of an action in some circumstances even when the controversy is no longer
concrete and tangible.  The rule that abstract, hypothetical or contingent
questions will not be heard is not absolute (see:  Tribe, American
Constitutional Law (2nd ed. 1988), at p. 84; Kates and Barker, ""Mootness
in Judicial Proceedings: Toward a Coherent Theory"" (1974), 62 Calif.
L.R. 1385).  A two-stage process is involved in which a
court may consider the merits of an appeal even where the issue is moot.

 

Is this
Appeal Moot?

 

    In
my opinion, there is no longer a live controversy or concrete dispute as the
substratum of Mr. Borowski's appeal has disappeared.  The basis for the action
was a challenge relating to the constitutionality of subss. (4), (5) and (6) of
s. 251.  That section of the Criminal Code  having been struck
down in R. v. Morgentaler (No. 2), supra, the raison
d'être of the action has disappeared.  None of the relief
claimed in the statement of claim is relevant.  Three of the five
constitutional questions that were set explicitly concern s. 251  and are
no longer applicable.  The remaining two questions addressing the scope of ss.
7  and 15  Charter  rights are not severable from the
context of the original challenge to s. 251 .  These questions were only
ancillary to the central issue of the alleged unconstitutionality of the
abortion provisions of the Criminal Code .  They were a mere
step in the process of measuring the impugned provision against the Charter .  

 

    In
any event, this Court is not bound by the wording of any constitutional
question which is stated.  Nor may the question be used to transform an appeal
into a reference:  Vadebonc{oe}ur v. Landry, [1977] 2 S.C.R.
179, at pp. 187-88, and Bisaillon v. Keable, [1983] 2 S.C.R.
60, at p. 71.  The procedural requirements of Rule 32 of the Rules of
the Supreme Court of Canada are not designed to introduce new issues but to define
with precision the constitutional points in issue which emerge from the
record.  Rule 32 provides:

 

    32.  (1)  When a party to an appeal

 

(a)  intends to raise a question as to the
constitutional validity or the constitutional applicability of a statute of the
Parliament of Canada or of a legislature of a province or of Regulations made
thereunder,

 

(b)  intends to urge the inoperability of a statute of
the Parliament of Canada or of a legislature of a province or of Regulations
made thereunder.

 

such
party shall, upon notice to the other parties, apply to the Chief Justice or a
Judge for the purpose of stating the question, within thirty days from the
granting of leave to appeal or within thirty days from the filing of the notice
of appeal in an appeal with leave of the court of final resort in a province,
the Federal Court of Appeal, or in an appeal as of right.

 

The
questions cannot, therefore, be employed as an independent basis for supporting
an appeal that is otherwise moot.

 

    By
reason of the foregoing, I conclude that this appeal is moot.  It is necessary,
therefore, to move to the second stage of the analysis by examining the basis
upon which this Court should exercise its discretion either to hear or to
decline to hear this appeal.

 

The
Exercise of Discretion:  Relevant Criteria

 

    Since
the discretion which is exercised relates to the enforcement of a policy or
practice of the Court, it is not surprising that a neat set of criteria does
not emerge from an examination of the cases.  This same problem in the United
States led commentators there to remark that ""the law is a morass of
inconsistent or unrelated theories, and cogent judicial generalization is
sorely needed.""  (Kates and Barker, ""Mootness in Judicial
Proceedings: Toward a Coherent Theory"", supra, at p.
1387).  I would add that more than a cogent generalization is probably
undesirable because an exhaustive list would unduly fetter the court's
discretion in future cases.  It is, however, a discretion to be judicially
exercised with due regard for established principles.

 

    In
formulating guidelines for the exercise of discretion in departing from a usual
practice, it is instructive to examine its underlying rationalia.  To the
extent that a particular foundation for the practice is either absent or its
presence tenuous, the reason for its enforcement disappears or diminishes.

 

    The
first rationale for the policy and practice referred to above is that a court's
competence to resolve legal disputes is rooted in the adversary system.  The
requirement of an adversarial context is a fundamental tenet of our legal
system and helps guarantee that issues are well and fully argued by parties who
have a stake in the outcome.  It is apparent that this requirement may be
satisfied if, despite the cessation of a live controversy, the necessary
adversarial relationships will nevertheless prevail.  For example, although the
litigant bringing the proceeding may no longer have a direct interest in the
outcome, there may be collateral consequences of the outcome that will provide
the necessary adversarial context.  This was one of the factors which played a
role in the exercise of this Court's discretion in Vic Restaurant Inc.
v. City of Montreal, supra.  The restaurant, for which a renewal
of permits to sell liquor and operate a restaurant was sought, had been sold
and therefore no mandamus for a licence could be given.  Nevertheless, there
were prosecutions outstanding against the appellant for violation of the
municipal by-law which was the subject of the legal challenge.  Determination
of the validity of this by-law was a collateral consequence which provided the
appellant with a necessary interest which otherwise would have been lacking.

 

    In
the United States, the role of collateral consequences in the exercise of
discretion to hear a case is well recognized.  In Southern Pacific Co.
v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 219 U.S. 433 (1911), the United
States Supreme Court was asked to examine an order of the Interstate Commerce
Commission which fixed maximum rates for certain transportation charges. 
Despite the expiry of this order, it was held, in part, that the remaining
potential liability of the railway company to shippers comprised a collateral
consequence justifying a decision on the merits.  The principle that collateral
consequences of an already completed cause of action warrant appellate review
was most clearly stated in Sibron v. New York, supra.  The
appellant in that case appealed his conviction although his sentence had
already been completed.  At page 55, Warren C.J. stated:

 

. . .
most criminal convictions do in fact entail adverse collateral legal
consequences.  The mere ""possibility"" that this will be the case is
enough to preserve a criminal case from ending ""ignominiously in the limbo
of mootness.""

 

    In
Canada, the cases of Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, supra, and R. v.
Mercure, supra, illustrate the workings of this
principle.  In those cases, the presence of interveners who had a stake in the
outcome supplied the necessary adversarial context to enable the Court to hear
the cases.

 

    The
second broad rationale on which the mootness doctrine is based is the concern
for judicial economy.  (See:  Sharpe, ""Mootness, Abstract Questions and
Alternative Grounds:  Deciding Whether to Decide"", Charter
Litigation.)  It is an unfortunate reality that there is a need to
ration scarce judicial resources among competing claimants.  The fact that in
this Court the number of live controversies in respect of which leave is
granted is a small percentage of those that are refused is sufficient to
highlight this observation.  The concern for judicial economy as a factor in
the decision not to hear moot cases will be answered if the special
circumstances of the case make it worthwhile to apply scarce judicial resources
to resolve it.

 

    The
concern for conserving judicial resources is partially answered in cases that
have become moot if the court's decision will have some practical effect on the
rights of the parties notwithstanding that it will not have the effect of
determining the controversy which gave rise to the action.  The influence of
this factor along with that of the first factor referred to above is evident in Vic
Restaurant Inc. v. City of Montreal, supra.

 

    Similarly
an expenditure of judicial resources is considered warranted in cases which
although moot are of a recurring nature but brief duration.  In order to ensure
that an important question which might independently evade review be heard by
the court, the mootness doctrine is not applied strictly.  This was the
situation in International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local
Union 2085 v. Winnipeg Builders' Exchange, supra.  The
issue was the validity of an interlocutory injunction prohibiting certain
strike action.  By the time the case reached this Court the strike had been
settled.  This is the usual result of the operation of a temporary injunction
in labour cases.  If the point was ever to be tested, it almost had to be in a
case that was moot.  Accordingly, this Court exercised its discretion to hear
the case.  To the same effect are Le Syndicat des Employés du Transport de
Montréal v. Attorney General of Quebec, [1970] S.C.R.
713, and Wood, Wire and Metal Lathers' Int. Union v. United
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, [1973] S.C.R.
756.  The mere fact, however, that a case raising the same point is likely to
recur even frequently should not by itself be a reason for hearing an appeal
which is moot.  It is preferable to wait and determine the point in a genuine
adversarial context unless the circumstances suggest that the dispute will have
always disappeared before it is ultimately resolved.

 

    There
also exists a rather ill-defined basis for justifying the deployment of
judicial resources in cases which raise an issue of public importance of which
a resolution is in the public interest.  The economics of judicial involvement
are weighed against the social cost of continued uncertainty in the law.  See Minister
of Manpower and Immigration v. Hardayal, [1978] 1 S.C.R.
470, and Kates and Barker, supra, at pp. 1429-1431.  Locke J. alluded
to this in Vic Restaurant Inc. v. City of Montreal, supra, at p.
91:  ""The question, as I have said, is one of general public interest to
municipal institutions throughout Canada.""

 

    This
was the basis for the exercise of this Court's discretion in the Re
Opposition by Quebec to a Resolution to amend the Constitution, [1982]
2 S.C.R. 793.  The question of the constitutionality of the patriation of the
Constitution had, in effect, been rendered moot by the occurrence of the
event.  The Court stated at p. 806:

 

    While this Court retains its discretion to entertain
or not to entertain an appeal as of right where the issue has become moot, it
may, in the exercise of its discretion, take into consideration the importance
of the constitutional issue determined by a court of appeal judgment which would
remain unreviewed by this Court.

 

    In
the circumstances of this case, it appears desirable that the constitutional
question be answered in order to dispel any doubt over it and it accordingly
will be answered.

 

    Patently,
the mere presence of an issue of national importance in an appeal which is
otherwise moot is insufficient.  National importance is a requirement for all
cases before this Court except with respect to appeals as of right; the latter,
Parliament has apparently deemed to be in a category of sufficient importance
to be heard here.  There must, therefore, be the additional ingredient of
social cost in leaving the matter undecided.  This factor appears to have
weighed heavily in the decision of the majority of this Court in Forget v.
Quebec (Attorney General), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 90.

 

    The
third underlying rationale of the mootness doctrine is the need for the Court
to demonstrate a measure of awareness of its proper law-making function.  The
Court must be sensitive to its role as the adjudicative branch in our political
framework.  Pronouncing judgments in the absence of a dispute affecting the
rights of the parties may be viewed as intruding into the role of the
legislative branch.  This need to maintain some flexibility in this regard has
been more clearly identified in the United States where mootness is one aspect
of a larger concept of justiciability.  (See:  Kates and Barker, ""Mootness
in Judicial Proceedings: Toward a Coherent Theory"", supra, and
Tribe, American Constitutional Law (2nd ed. 1988), at
p. 67.)

 

    In
my opinion, it is also one of the three basic purposes of the mootness doctrine
in Canada and a most important factor in this case.  I generally agree with the
following statement in P. Macklem and E. Gertner:  ""Re Skapinker and
Mootness Doctrine"" (1984), 6 Sup. Ct. L. Rev. 369, at
p. 373:

 

    The
latter function of the mootness doctrine -- political flexibility -- can be
understood as the added degree of flexibility, in an allegedly moot dispute, in
the law-making function of the Court.  The mootness doctrine permits the Court
not to hear a case on the ground that there no longer exists a dispute between
the parties, notwithstanding the fact that it is of the opinion that it is a
matter of public importance.  Though related to the factor of judicial economy,
insofar as it implies a determination of whether deciding the case will lead to
unnecessary precedent, political flexibility enables the Court to be sensitive
to its role within the Canadian constitutional framework, and at the same time
reflects the degree to which the Court can control the development of the law.

 

I
prefer, however, not to use the term ""political flexibility"" in order
to avoid confusion with the political questions doctrine.  In considering the
exercise of its discretion to hear a moot case, the Court should be sensitive
to the extent that it may be departing from its traditional role.

 

    In
exercising its discretion in an appeal which is moot, the Court should consider
the extent to which each of the three basic rationalia for enforcement of the
mootness doctrine is present.  This is not to suggest that it is a mechanical
process.  The principles identified above may not all support the same
conclusion.  The presence of one or two of the factors may be overborne by the
absence of the third, and vice versa.

 

Exercise
of Discretion:  Application of Criteria

 

    Applying
these criteria to this appeal, I have little or no concern about the absence of
an adversarial relationship.  The appeal was fully argued with as much zeal and
dedication on both sides as if the matter were not moot.

 

    The
second factor to be considered is the need to promote judicial economy. 
Counsel for the appellant argued that an extensive record had been developed in
the courts below which would be wasted if the case were not decided on the
merits.  Although there is some merit in this position, the same can be said
for most cases that come to this Court.  To give effect to this argument would
emasculate the mootness doctrine which by definition applies if at any stage
the foundation for the action disappears.  Neither can the fact that this Court
reserved on the preliminary points and heard the appeal be weighed in favour of
the appellant.  In the absence of a motion to quash in advance of the appeal,
it was the only practical course that could be taken to prevent the possible
bifurcation of the appeal.  It would be anomalous if, by reserving on the
mootness question and hearing the argument on the merits, the Court fettered
its discretion to decide it.

 

    None
of the other factors that I have canvassed which justify the application of
judicial resources is applicable.  This is not a case where a decision will
have practical side effects on the rights of the parties.  Nor is it a case
that is capable of repetition, yet evasive of review.  It will almost certainly
be possible to bring the case before the Court within a specific legislative
context or possibly in review of specific governmental action.  In addition, an
abstract pronouncement on foetal rights in this case would not necessarily
promote judicial economy as it is very conceivable that the courts will be
asked to examine specific legislation or governmental action in any event. 
Therefore, while I express no opinion as to foetal rights, it is far from clear
that a decision on the merits will obviate the necessity for future repetitious
litigation.

 

    Moreover,
while it raises a question of great public importance, this is not a case in
which it is in the public interest to address the merits in order to settle the
state of the law.  The appellant is asking for an interpretation of ss. 7  and
15  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  at
large.  In a legislative context any rights of the foetus could be considered
or at least balanced against the rights of women guaranteed by s. 7 .  See R. v.
Morgentaler (No. 2), supra, per
Dickson C.J., at p. 75; per Beetz J. at pp. 122-23; per Wilson
J. at pp. 181-82.  A pronouncement in favour of the appellant's position that a
foetus is protected by s. 7  from the date of conception would decide the
issue out of its proper context.  Doctors and hospitals would be left to
speculate as to how to apply such a ruling consistently with a woman's rights
under s. 7 .  During argument the question was posed to counsel for R.E.A.L.
Women as to what a hospital would do with a pregnant woman who required an abortion
to save her life in the face of a ruling in favour of the appellant's
position.  The answer was that doctors and legislators would have to stay up at
night to decide how to deal with the situation.  This state of uncertainty
would clearly not be in the public interest.  Instead of rendering the law
certain, a decision favourable to the appellant would have the opposite effect.

 

    Even
if I were disposed in favour of the appellant in respect to the first two
factors which I have canvassed, I would decline to exercise a discretion in
favour of deciding this appeal on the basis of the third.  One element of this
third factor is the need to demonstrate some sensitivity to the effectiveness
or efficacy of judicial intervention.  The need for courts to exercise some
flexibility in the application of the mootness doctrine requires more than a
consideration of the importance of the subject matter.  The appellant is
requesting a legal opinion on the interpretation of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  in the absence of legislation or
other governmental action which would otherwise bring the Charter  into
play.  This is something only the government may do.  What the appellant seeks
is to turn this appeal into a private reference.  Indeed, he is not seeking to
have decided the same question that was the subject of his action.  That
question related to the validity of s. 251  of the Criminal
Code .  He now wishes to ask a question that relates to the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  alone.  This is not a request to
decide a moot question but to decide a different, abstract question.  To accede
to this request would intrude on the right of the executive to order a
reference and pre-empt a possible decision of Parliament by dictating the form
of legislation it should enact.  To do so would be a marked departure from the
traditional role of the Court.

 

    Having
decided that this appeal is moot, I would decline to exercise the Court's
discretion to decide it on the merits.

 

Standing

 

    Mr.
Borowski's original action alleged that subss. (4), (5) and (6) of the Criminal
Code  violated the s. 1  right to life of the Canadian
Bill of Rights: Minister of Justice of Canada v. Borowski, supra.  This
Court held Borowski had standing as he was able to demonstrate a ""genuine
interest"" in the validity of the legislation.

 

    Standing
was granted premised upon Mr. Borowski's desire to challenge specific
legislation.  Martland J. considered the earlier standing decisions of the
Supreme Court in Thorson v. Attorney General of Canada, [1975]
1 S.C.R. 138, and Nova Scotia Board of Censors v. McNeil, [1976]
2 S.C.R. 265, and concluded that the appellant had standing by reason of his
""genuine interest as a citizen in the validity of the legislation""
under attack (at p. 598):

 

    The
Court relied heavily upon the decision in Thorson, supra, where
Laskin J. (as he then was), speaking for the majority, stated at p. 161:

 

    In
my opinion, standing of a federal taxpayer seeking to challenge the
constitutionality of federal legislation is a matter particularly
appropriate for the exercise of judicial discretion, relating as it does to the
effectiveness of process.  Central to that discretion is the justiciability of
the issue sought to be raised . . . . [Emphasis added.]

 

I
believe these decisions were clear in allowing an expanded basis for standing
where specific legislation is challenged on constitutional grounds.

 

    There
have been two significant changes in the nature of this action since this Court
granted Mr. Borowski standing in 1981.  The claim is now premised primarily
upon an alleged right of a foetus to life and equality pursuant to ss. 7  and 15 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  Secondly, by
holding s. 251 to be of no force and effect in R. v. Morgentaler
(No. 2), supra, the legislative context of this
claim has disappeared.

 

    By
virtue of s. 24(1)  of the Charter  and 52(1) of the
Constitution Act, 1982 , there are two possible means of gaining standing under
the Charter .  Section 24(1)  provides:

 

    24. (1)
Anyone whose rights or freedoms as guaranteed by this Charter , have been
infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain
such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.

 

    In
my opinion s. 24(1)  cannot be relied upon here as a basis for standing. 
Section 24(1)  clearly requires an infringement or denial of a Charter -based
right.  The appellant's claim does not meet this requirement as he alleges that
the rights of a foetus, not his own rights, have been violated.

 

    Nor
can s. 52(1)  of the Constitution Act, 1982  be invoked to
extend standing to Mr. Borowski.  Section 52(1)  reads:

 

    52. (1) 
The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law that is
inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to the extent of the
inconsistency, of no force or effect.

 

This
section offers an alternative means of securing standing based on the Thorson, McNeil, Borowski trilogy
expansion of the doctrine.

 

    Nevertheless,
in the same manner that the ""standing trilogy"" referred to above was
based on a challenge to specific legislation, so too a challenge based on s.
52(1)  of the Constitution Act, 1982  is restricted to
litigants who challenge a law or governmental action pursuant to power granted
by law.  The appellant in this appeal challenges neither ""a law"" nor
any governmental action so as to engage the provisions of the Charter .  What
the appellant now seeks is a naked interpretation of two provisions of the Charter .  This
would require the Court to answer a purely abstract question which would in
effect sanction a private reference.  In my opinion, the original basis for the
appellant's standing is gone and the appellant lacks standing to pursue this
appeal.

 

    Accordingly,
the appeal is dismissed on both the grounds that it is moot and that the
appellant lacks standing to continue the appeal.  In my opinion, in lieu of
applying to adjourn the appeal, the respondent should have moved to quash. 
Certainly, such a motion should have been brought after the adjournment was
denied.  Failure to do so has resulted in the needless expense to the appellant
of preparing and arguing the appeal before this Court.  In the circumstance, it
is appropriate that the respondent pay to the appellant the costs of the appeal
incurred subsequent to the disposition of the motion to adjourn which was made
on July 19, 1988.

on appeal from the court of appeal for

    Criminal
law -- Extraordinary remedies -- Habeas corpus -- Jurisdiction of Court of
Appeal -- Whether Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to hear the case on the
merits -- Whether writ of habeas corpus should have been returned to the court
of first instance for consideration of the merits ‑‑ Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 613(1)(b)(iii), (iv), 719(2) -- Act for more

Vict., c. 45, s. 1 -- Ontario Supreme Court Rules Respecting Criminal
Proceedings -- Part I, SI/85-152, rules 9, 11.

 

    The
High Court of Ontario dismissed appellant's application for a writ of habeas
corpus and the order was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The
Court of Appeal found that  the written material filed by the appellant
disclosed an arguable case and that the court of first instance ought either to
have issued the writ or to have afforded the appellant the opportunity to
appear and make submissions. The Court concluded, however, that it was
unnecessary to send the application back to the court of first instance because
all relevant material was before the Court. With the full participation of the
appellant, the Court of Appeal considered the merits of the case and dismissed
the application. In this Court, the appellant argued, in light of the two-stage habeas
corpus procedure in effect in Ontario, that the Court of
Appeal had no jurisdiction to hear the merits of the case  and that the writ of habeas
corpus should have been returned to the High Court for
consideration of the merits.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

    Section
613(1) (b)(iv) of the Criminal Code  applies
by virtue of s. 719(2)  which renders applicable Part XVIII of the Code. These
provisions, although drafted to meet the situation of an appeal from a
conviction, are to be read mutatis mutandis, and are broad
enough to encompass the Court of Appeal's dismissal of the application for habeas
corpus on the merits in the present circumstances. In any
event, even if the Court of Appeal erred in failing to remit the matter to the
court of first instance, the error was a purely mechanical one which could be
cured by s. 613(1) (b)(iii).  To send the matter back to the High Court would
be a triumph of form over substance. The result would inevitably be the same,
as all the material was before the Court of Appeal and the appellant was
afforded full opportunity to make submissions.

//The Court//

 

    The
following is the judgment delivered by

 

    THE COURT -- This
is an appeal from the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal (1987), 62 O.R.
(2d) 321, which dismissed an appeal from Maloney J., who refused an application
for a writ of habeas corpus made in writing by
the appellant, then unrepresented by counsel, without affording the appellant
an opportunity to be present and make submissions.

 

    Brooke
J.A., speaking for the Court of Appeal, held that the written material filed by
the appellant disclosed an arguable case and that Maloney J. ought to either
have issued the writ or, in some other manner, afforded the appellant an
opportunity to appear and make submissions.  He stated (at pp. 329-30):

 

However,
in my respectful opinion, in view of the material filed, there were serious
matters to consider being whether the appellant is lawfully detained in
segregation, if he is held there on the order of the previous Solicitor-General
and further whether his detention in segregation for the past five years, with
a prospect of further detention for many years, was cruel and unusual
treatment.  In the circumstances, Maloney J. should either have directed that
the appellant be brought before him to argue the case as though the writ had
been issued or, alternatively, to issue the writ and afford the applicant the
opportunity to appear and respond to the submissions of his jailer on the
hearing upon the return of the writ.  It was not good enough to leave this
matter by denying the applicant an opportunity to be heard.

 

    By
virtue of the combined effect of the Act for more
effectually securing the Liberty of Subject, S. Prov. C. 1866,
29 & 30 Vict., c. 45 (the Habeas Corpus Act), and
Rules 9 and 11 of the Ontario Supreme Court Rules Respecting Criminal
Proceedings -- Part I, SI/85-152, as amended, the application for a writ of habeas
corpus is a two-stage process.  In the first stage the judge
to whom the application is made must determine whether ""probable and
reasonable ground"" for the complaint exists as provided in s. 1 of the Habeas
Corpus Act.  If such grounds are present, the writ issues and the
merits are determined on the return of the writ.  However, Rule 11 provides a
mechanism for collapsing these two stages into one.  Rule 11 provides that on
consent the issue of the writ, the return thereto and the presence of the
detainee may be dispensed with.  This is the usual practice where the applicant
is represented by counsel.  Where a written application by a prisoner proceeds
to the second stage of detailed consideration of the merits, it is common
practice to dispense with the formality of actually issuing the writ by simply
ordering the prisoner to be brought before the court to make submissions.

 

    As
we understand the reasons of Brooke J.A., he was of the opinion that
""probable and reasonable ground"" for the complaint existed and that
the matter should have proceeded to the second stage, either by issuing the
writ or by simply having the appellant brought before the court to present his
case.

 

    The
Court of Appeal concluded, however, that it was unnecessary to send the
application back to Maloney J., because all relevant material was before that
court and upon the invitation and with the full participation of the appellant,
who appeared in person, the merits were fully examined.  The Court concluded
that the grounds in fact had no merit.  The distinction is, of course, one that
is well-known in law.  Often, what appears to be an arguable case in fact turns
out to be without merit.

 

    The
issue before this Court is whether the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to
dispose of the application in the manner just described.  The appellant now
seeks to argue that the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to hear the
argument on the merits and that the matter should be remitted to Maloney J. to
consider the merits of the grounds that the Court of Appeal has already found
to be without merit.

 

    In
our opinion, this mechanical approach should be avoided.  By virtue of s.
719(2) rendering applicable Part XVIII of the Criminal Code , s.
613(1) (b)(iv) applies.  Those provisions, although drafted to
meet the situation of an appeal from a conviction, are to be read mutatis
mutandis, and are broad enough to permit the Court of Appeal to
have dismissed the application for habeas corpus on the
merits in the circumstances presented here.  In any event, even if the Court of
Appeal did err in failing to remit the matter to Maloney J., the error was a
purely mechanical one which could be cured by s. 613(1) (b)(iii). 
To send the matter back before Maloney J. would be a triumph of form over
substance.  The result would inevitably be the same, as all the material was
before the Court of Appeal and the appellant was afforded full opportunity to
make submissions.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

law -- Defence of compulsion -- Perjury -- Defence of compulsion not applicable

    Appellant
gave false evidence at a preliminary inquiry and was charged with perjury and
obstructing justice.  At trial, appellant admitted that he had deliberately
lied but stated that he had no intent to mislead the court.  He relied on s. 17 
of the Criminal Code  and alleged that he had given false evidence under
compulsion by death threats made against him.  The trial judge applied s. 17 
and acquitted appellant on the charge of perjury.  Appellant was also acquitted
on the charge of obstructing justice.  The Court of Appeal reversed the
acquittal on the first count and affirmed the acquittal on the second.  The
Court found that s. 17 of the Code was not applicable
in the case at bar since the threats, the risk of death and the offence were
not concomitant.  A death threat which a person can easily escape and can
render unenforceable when giving evidence will not be a basis for invoking the
excuse of compulsion provided for in s. 17 .  The Court also found that there
was no reasonable doubt as to appellant's specific intent to mislead the
court.  Appellant appealed from his conviction for perjury and respondent cross‑appealed
from the acquittal on the charge of obstructing justice.

 

    Held:  The
appeals should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

//The Court//

 

    English
version of the judgment delivered by

 

    THE COURT -- The
trial judge, pursuant to s. 17 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, acquitted appellant Hébert on a charge of perjury.  He was also
acquitted on a charge of obstructing justice.  The Crown appealed from both
acquittals. We all agree with the Court of Appeal (1986), 3 Q.A.C. 251 that in
so doing the trial judge erred, as the facts of the case at bar do not support
a defence based on s. 17  of the Criminal Code .

 

    Hébert
argued in the Court of Appeal that there was no mens rea and
that, in this regard, he had been deprived of his right to a full answer and
defence.  The Court of Appeal rejected this argument, allowed one of the
appeals and found Hébert guilty of perjury. On the other hand, his acquittal on
the second count was upheld. Hébert appealed to this Court from the count of
perjury and the Crown cross-appealed from the acquittal on the count of
obstructing justice. We are all of the view that the appeal and the
cross-appeal should be allowed.

 

    While
appellant Hébert admitted that he deliberately lied in giving testimony, he
nonetheless stated that he had no intent to mislead in so doing but that, quite
the contrary, he intended that the way in which he testified would result in
his not being believed and was designed solely to attract the judge's attention
so he could tell the judge about the threats which had been made against him.

 

    In
concluding that [TRANSLATION] ""Whatever reasons prompted respondent to make a
deceptive statement, he could not do so in the case at bar without intending to
mislead the court"" (pp. 254-55), the Court of Appeal did not take into
account this defence by appellant, and the trial judge also made no ruling on
it.

 

    For
there to be perjury there has to be more than a deliberate false statement. 
The statement must also have been made with intent to mislead.  While it is
true that someone who lies generally does so with the intent of being believed,
it is not impossible, though it may be exceptional, for a person to
deliberately lie without intending to mislead.  It is always open to an accused
to seek to establish such an intent by his testimony or otherwise, leaving to
the trial judge the task of assessing its weight.  The trial judge did not
allow the accused to complete his evidence in this regard, probably because he
knew he was going to acquit him on other grounds; that acquittal however was
properly set aside on appeal.

 

    For
these reasons the ends of justice in the case at bar require that we allow both
appeals and that a new trial be ordered on both counts.

    Appellant
and another were charged with first degree murder and tried separately.  The
dispute primarily concerned the respective roles of appellant and the
co-accused:  each accused the other of robbing and fatally stabbing the
victim.  Appellant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life
imprisonment with no chance of parole for twenty-five years.  The co-accused
was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with
no chance of parole for twenty years.

 

    Appellant
appealed his conviction.  A malfunction of the transcribing equipment resulted
in gaps in the transcription of the proceedings received prior to the appeal
hearing.  One gap related to the judge's charge to the jury.  It was filled by
a narrative supplied by the trial judge based on his notes.

 

    Two
principal issues were raised in this appeal.  The first involves whether the
inability to prepare a proper and full transcript of the trial proceedings
prior to an appeal comprises a miscarriage of justice warranting a new trial. 
The second issue addresses the circumstances in which a trial judge need
explicitly warn a jury of the dangers of accepting uncorroborated testimony of
an accomplice.

 

    Held
(McIntyre, Lamer and Sopinka JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and Wilson, La Forest and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ.:  No miscarriage of justice
occurred in the circumstances of this case.  The appellant had a just and fair
trial before his peers.  A new trial need not be ordered for every gap in a
transcript.  As a general rule, there must be a serious possibility that there
was an error in the missing portion of the charge, or that the omission
deprived the appellant of a ground of appeal.

 

    The
facts of this case do not meet this test.  There was no ""serious
possibility of error"" in the missing portion of the charge to the jury. 
The notes of the trial judge were no doubt accurate, the jury had copies of the Criminal
Code  provisions, and no objection was made by counsel to the
charge.

 

    There
is no ""fixed and invariable rule"" regarding the appropriate charge
with respect to the testimony of accomplices.  Rather, an approach tailored to
the particular case should be adopted instead of assuming that all accomplices
are inherently untrustworthy as witnesses.  The trial judge here drew the
jury's attention to the fact that the co-accused was an accomplice and this
warning, combined with the discretion allowed the trial judge with respect to
the testimony of an accomplice, was sufficient to dismiss the second ground of
appeal.  The failure to give a clearer or sharper warning than the one given
could not have resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

 

    Per
McIntyre, Lamer and Sopinka J. (dissenting):  While section 609(2) clearly
requires that a record of trial proceedings be kept, not every failure to
comply with its reporting requirements will automatically entitle an appellant
to a new trial.  The effect of the gaps must be considered in relation to any
possible prejudice to an appellant's ability to appeal a conviction.  As a
general rule, a new trial will only be ordered where there is some reason to
believe that there may possibly have been an error in the passage of the charge
which was missing or that the omission otherwise may have deprived the
appellant of a ground of appeal.

 

    The
statutory requirements of s. 609(2)(b) were
clearly violated here and the summary based in part on the trial judge's notes
and provided by him had no curative effect.  Appeals based upon allegedly
inaccurate charges to the jury often turn on a few specific words, or specific
sentences.  It is not clear that in delivering his charge the trial judge
followed his notes verbatim.  The third gap in the transcript involved the
charge to the jury which is a central element of a murder trial and dealt with
the elements or requirements of murder.

 

    A
clear and sharp warning as to the unreliability of the uncorroborated evidence
of an accomplice ought to have been given in the special circumstances of this
case.

 

    Both
the failure to properly charge the jury and the incomplete record of the
proceedings by virtue of the gap in the transcript must be considered in
assessing if there has been a miscarriage of justice.  In the unique and
special circumstances of this case, neither of the two grounds individually
might have been sufficient to warrant a new trial but cumulatively they created
an appearance of a miscarriage of justice.

    The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and Wilson, La Forest and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ. was
delivered by

 

  L'HEUREUX-DUBÉ
J. -- On the evening of Wednesday, October 5, 1983 an 80-year-old
gentleman, sitting in his car outside the Glace Bay public library, was
approached by the appellant Hayes and Elmer King.  The two youths asked him to
drive them to a bootlegger.  When they assured him he could not get into
trouble for doing so, he consented.  It cost him his life.  At knife point, he
was ordered to drive onto a deserted gravel road where he was robbed, stabbed
repeatedly, and left to die.

 

    Both
the appellant Hayes and King were arrested and charged with first degree murder. 
They were tried in separate trials.  At Hayes' trial, King testified that it
was Hayes who fatally stabbed the deceased.  Hayes did not testify at the
subsequent trial of King.  King was convicted of second degree murder.  The
jury in the Hayes trial took no time to deliver a guilty verdict. Hayes was
convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with no
eligibility for parole for twenty-five years.

 

    The
appellant appealed the conviction to the Appeal Division of the Nova Scotia Supreme
Court, (1986), 67 N.S.R. (2d) 234.  The appeal was dismissed by a unanimous
bench of five judges.

 

    The
issue in this case is not murder:  there was a murder.  It is not
premeditation:  there was premeditation.  The issues raised in this case
concern essentially the charge of the trial judge to the jury and the problem
of missing portions of the trial transcript.

 

    The
two questions to be dealt with by this Court are set out in the factum of the
respondent as follows:

 

1.  Did the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Nova
Scotia err in law in holding that the inability of the Attorney General of Nova
Scotia to prepare a proper transcript of the proceedings at trial did not
result in a miscarriage of justice?

 

2.  Did
the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia err in law in holding
that the curative provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code 
could be used where at trial the learned trial Judge failed to give the Jury a
clear and sharp warning to attract their attention to the risks of adopting the
evidence of the co-accused on a trial for first degree murder?

 

    I am
of the view that Macdonald J.A. of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal
Division, correctly disposed of the appeal. 

 

    In
my opinion, no miscarriage of justice occurred in the circumstances of this
case.  The appellant had a just and fair trial before his peers.  The jury,
without need for lengthy deliberation, came to the conclusion that he was
guilty of first degree murder. 

 

    The
first two gaps in the transcript could not conceivably have prejudiced the
appellant.  They consisted essentially of conversations between the trial judge
and counsel.

 

    It
is the third gap which is problematic.  A portion of Burchell J.'s charge to
the jury is missing from the transcript.  Macdonald J.A. describes the gap as
follows at p. 237 of his reasons:

 

    The
last omission relates to the instructions given the jury by Mr. Justice
Burchell on homicide, murder and robbery.  The gap in the transcript was filled
by a narrative supplied by the trial judge based on what his notes indicated
was his charge on these matters.  He subsequently certified that his charge to
the jury was accurately set forth in the transcript of the proceedings as
contained in the case on appeal.

 

    A
new trial need not be ordered for every gap in a transcript.  As a general
rule, there must be a serious possibility that there was an error in the
missing portion of the transcript, or that the omission deprived the appellant
of a ground of appeal.

 

    In
my view, the facts of this case do not meet this test.  I see no ""serious
possibility of error"" in the missing portion of the charge to the jury.  I
have no doubt that the notes of Burchell J. are an accurate account of the
charge he gave to the jury.  As Macdonald J.A. points out, the jury was
provided with copies of the relevant Criminal Code 
sections.  Further, immediately after Burchell J.'s charge on the relevant law,
and before he proceeded with the portion of the charge dealing with the
evidence, Burchell J. recessed and asked counsel if they had any objections. 
It is important to note, as did Macdonald J.A., that counsel for the appellant
at trial did not object to the charge with respect to the particular Criminal
Code  sections.

 

    The
second issue raised in this appeal has to do with the trial judge's charge to
the jury relating to accomplice evidence.  I would like to emphasize that this
case illustrates the dangers and difficulties which may arise when co-accuseds
are not jointly tried.

 

    The
decision of this Court in Vetrovec v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R.
811, stands for the proposition that there was no ""fixed and invariable
rule"" regarding the appropriate charge with respect to the testimony of
accomplices.  Instead of assuming that all accomplices are inherently
untrustworthy as witnesses, Dickson J. (as he then was) advocated an approach
tailored to the particular case.  He wrote at p. 823:

 

Rather
than attempting to pigeon-hole a witness into a category and then recite a
ritualistic incantation, the trial judge might better direct his mind to the
facts of the case, and thoroughly examine all the factors which might impair
the worth of a particular witness.  If, in his judgment, the credit of the
witness is such that the jury should be cautioned, then he may instruct
accordingly.  If, on the other hand, he believes the witness to be trustworthy,
then, regardless of whether the witness is technically an `accomplice' no
warning is necessary.

 

    In
the present case, the trial judge drew the jury's attention to the fact that
King was an accomplice to the accused Hayes.  He stated:

 

Now, I am
sure your common sense and experience will tell you that it often happens when
two persons are involved in some criminal activity that one will try to place
the blame on the other to shield himself, sometimes for reasons of spite,
sometimes for other reasons.  There is also the possibility that where two
persons are involved in a criminal activity, each, either at the same time or
in turn, may attempt to place the blame on the other.  These are possibilities
that I am sure are obvious to you but you must have them in mind as you weigh
the testimony that has been placed before you in your effort to arrive at a
determination as to which witnesses are to believed and to what extent they are
to be believed.

 

    In
my view, this warning, combined with the discretion allowed by Vetrovec, supra, are
sufficient to dismiss the second ground of appeal.  On the facts of the present
case I cannot see how the failure to give a clearer or sharper warning than the
one given has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

 

    In
the result, I do not find that the two grounds of appeal, either separately or
in combination, give rise to the appearance of a failure of justice.  I would
accordingly dismiss the appeal.

 

    The
reasons of McIntyre, Lamer and Sopinka JJ. were delivered by

 

  SOPINKA J.
(dissenting) -- Two principal issues were raised in this appeal.  The first
involves whether the inability to prepare a proper and full transcript of the
trial proceedings prior to an appeal comprises a miscarriage of justice
warranting a new trial.  The second issue addresses the circumstances in which
a trial judge need explicitly warn a jury of the dangers of accepting
uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.

 

Facts

 

    Hayes
was convicted of first degree murder in March 1984 before Burchell J. of the
Nova Scotia Supreme Court and a jury.  The appellant was sentenced to life
imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for twenty-five years.

 

    The
circumstances giving rise to this charge and conviction concern the murder of
Edmund Foster.  On the evening of October 5, 1983, the deceased, Foster, agreed
to drive the appellant and Elmer King to a bootlegger.  After the three drove
outside the town of Glace Bay, a knife was held to Foster and he was robbed of
his wallet.  King then drove the car off the main highway to a rather deserted
location where Foster was repeatedly stabbed with a knife.  Foster died at the
scene as a result of these wounds.  The appellant and King then drove the
deceased's car back into Glace Bay where it was set on fire.

 

    Both
the appellant and King were subsequently arrested and charged with first degree
murder relating to the death of Foster.  At Hayes' trial, King testified that
the robbery and murder were both carried out by Hayes.  In turn, Hayes took the
stand and claimed that it was King who robbed and fatally stabbed Foster.  The
dispute primarily concerned the respective roles of Hayes and King.

 

    Following
the conviction of the appellant, King was tried for murder relating to the same
incident.  The jury returned a verdict of guilt on second degree murder.  King
was sentenced to life imprisonment with no chance of parole for twenty years.

 

    The
appellant launched an appeal of his conviction before the Appeal Division of
the Nova Scotia Supreme Court (R. v. Hayes (1985), 67 N.S.R.
(2d) 234).  However, when the transcripts of the trial were received prior to
the appeal hearing, it was evident that there were gaps in the transcription of
the proceedings.  Apparently the gaps resulted from a malfunction of the
transcribing equipment.

 

Incomplete
Transcript

 

    The
first ground of appeal before this Court is that the Appeal Division of the
Nova Scotia Supreme Court erred in holding that the inability of the
Attorney-General of Nova Scotia to provide a full transcript of the appellant's
trial did not comprise a miscarriage of justice.  Macdonald J.A. of the
N.S.S.C.A.D. described the three gaps in the transcript as follows:

 

                            1.A discussion between
counsel and Mr. Justice Burchell after the close of the second day of the trial.

 

                            2.A discussion between
counsel and Mr. Justice Burchell with respect to the cross examination of the
appellant on his juvenile record.

 

                            3.A
portion of Mr. Justice Burchell's charge to the jury on which he gave his
initial instructions on Code s. 205 (homicide), s. 212
(murder), s. 213 (constructive murder) and s. 302 (robbery).

 

    The Criminal
Code  requires that a transcript of the proceedings at trial
be prepared.  Section 609(2)  provides:

 

                                        609.  . . .

 

    (2)  A copy or transcript of 

 

(a) the evidence taken at trial,

 

(b) the charge to the jury, if any,

 

(c) the reasons for judgment, if any, and

 

(d) the addresses of the prosecutor and the accused or
counsel for the accused by way of summing up, if

 

(i) a ground for the appeal is based upon either of the
addresses, or

 

(ii)  the appeal is pursuant to section 604,

 

shall be
furnished to the court of appeal, except in so far as it is dispensed with by
order of a judge of that court.

 

    Clearly
s. 609(2) establishes a mandatory requirement that a record of trial
proceedings be kept.  The breach of this provision was recognized by Macdonald
J.A. in the court below.  However the Appeal Division of the Nova Scotia
Supreme Court was not persuaded that the non-transcription of the three
portions of the appellant's trial amounted to a miscarriage of justice.

 

    Redress
for non-compliance with s. 609(2) is provided for in s. 613(1) (a)(iii)
of the Criminal Code :

 

    613. (1) On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit, on
account of insanity, to stand his trial, or against a special verdict of not
guilty on account of insanity, the court of appeal

 

    (a)  may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that

 

(i)  the verdict should be set aside on the ground that
it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,

 

(ii)  the judgment of the trial court should be set
aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or

 

(iii)  on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;


 

    (b)  may dismiss the appeal where

 

(i)  the court is of the opinion that the appellant,
although he was not properly convicted on a count or part of the indictment,
was properly convicted on another count or part of the indictment.

 

(ii)  the appeal is not decided in favour of the
appellant on any ground mentioned in paragraph (a), or

 

(iii)
notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned
in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in favour of the
appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has occurred;

 

    Macdonald
J.A. concluded that the first two gaps in the transcript did not result in a
miscarriage of justice.  In my opinion, this conclusion is correct as it is
inconceivable that these gaps could have prejudiced the appellant's appeal
rights to any meaningful degree.

 

    The
third gap in the transcript is somewhat more problematic.  The charge to the
jury is obviously a central element of a murder trial.  The malfunctioning of
the recording equipment resulted in the absence of a portion of the charge to
the jury by Burchell J.  The gap included a review of ss. 205 and 212 relating
to the requirements of murder.  As well, the missing portion of the transcript
included the charge relating to s. 302 (robbery) which is one of the underlying
offences to s. 213 (constructive murder).  It would appear that the full charge
relating to s. 213 itself was properly transcribed.

 

    Evidently,
Burchell J. was notified of the gaps in the transcript as the following proviso
appears at the point of the transcript where the tape was blank:

 

(Due to
the fact that a portion of the tape is blank Justice Burchell has perused his
notes and has made the following comments regarding the missing portion.)

 

    Macdonald
J.A. appeared to rely in part upon this narrative provided by the trial judge
in holding that there was no miscarriage of justice.  As well, Macdonald J.A.
held, at p. 237:

 

    On
the facts of this case there is no doubt that Mr. Foster was robbed and
murdered.  The only issues were whether the appellant was involved in either or
both of these crimes and, if so, whether his conduct made him guilty of murder
either in the first or second degree.

 

    I
agree with Macdonald J.A. that not every failure to comply with the reporting
requirements of s. 609(2) will automatically entitle an appellant to a new
trial.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal expressed such a view in R. v.
Horvat (1977), 34 C.C.C. (2d) 73.  (Leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada was refused May 16, 1977, [1977] 1 S.C.R. viii).

 

    In R. v.
Horvat a transcript of the testimony of several witnesses was
unavailable.  Robertson J.A. speaking for the court held that a gap did not
necessarily result in a miscarriage of justice.  In that case, the trial judge
had made available his own resumés of the missing testimony.  Robertson J.A.
then considered each witness whose testimony was not transcribed in an effort
to determine if the failure to provide a full record of the trial may have
resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  Based on a detailed analysis of the
potential testimony that each of the witnesses could have given, the B.C. Court
of Appeal concluded that the absence of a complete transcript did not prejudice
Horvat's appeal rights.

 

    I
agree that the correct approach is to consider the effect of the gaps in
relation to any possible prejudice to an appellant's ability to appeal a
conviction.  The central role which the charge to the jury assumes in an appeal
of a jury's verdict must be considered.  However, not every gap in the
transcript of a charge will justify granting a new trial.  As a general rule, a
new trial will only be ordered where there is some reason to believe that there
may possibly have been an error in the passage of the charge which was missing
or that the omission otherwise may have deprived the appellant of a ground of
appeal.

 

    While
a summary or narrative provided by a trial judge may in certain situations
negate any possible miscarriage of justice, I do not believe that the comments
provided by the trial judge have such a curative effect in this case.  Appeals
based upon allegedly inaccurate charges to the jury often turn on a few
specific words, or specific sentences.  Although the narrative here was based
on what was said to the jury, it does not purport to be an exact transcript of
the charge.  The summary provided by Burchell J. was based in part on notes
prepared prior to the delivery of his charge to the jury and it is by no means
clear that he followed them verbatim.

 

    The
appellant has been denied the opportunity to examine the instructions to the jury,
greatly restricting his ability to determine if an error was made.  In general,
it is more difficult to conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred where
the incomplete transcript omits important passages from the charge to the jury.

 

    The
Appeal Division of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court stated that the only issue was
whether the appellant was involved in either or both of the robbery and
murder.  Admittedly there is no doubt that Foster was murdered.  Both the
appellant and King testified that the other had alone committed the stabbing.

 

    I
recognize that this makes the charge to the jury relating to ss. 205, 212 and
302 less relevant than in other situations.  However, the fact that the central
issue was which of the two men charged with the murder was telling the truth
does not exempt the Crown from the necessity of proving all the requisite
elements of murder.  The trial judge is still required to charge the jury as to
the elements of the offence and that they must be demonstrated beyond a
reasonable doubt.

 

    Clearly,
there was a violation of the statutory requirements of s. 609(2)(b).  In
the circumstances of this case it is appropriate to consider the second ground
of appeal before determining whether a miscarriage of justice occurred and a
new trial should be ordered.

 

The
Evidence of an Accomplice

 

    The
second issue in this appeal involves the question of whether or not the trial
judge was obliged to caution the jury of the dangers of accepting the evidence
of King.  The appellant argues that the jury should have been given a clear and
sharp warning to attract their attention to the risks of adopting the evidence
of a co-accused such as King.

 

    In Vetrovec
v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811, this Court put an end to the
fixed and inflexible rule which made it mandatory that a warning be given to
the jury with respect to the evidence of any accomplice.

 

    Dickson
J. (as he then was) recognized that the underlying concern had been that the
evidence of some witnesses need be approached with caution where the witness's
trustworthiness was in question.  It had been argued that an accomplice could
not be trusted since he would want to suggest his innocence or minor
participation in the crime by transferring the blame to others.

 

    At
page 823, Dickson J. held:

 

    None
of these arguments can justify a fixed and invariable rule regarding all
accomplices.  All that can be established is that the testimony of some
accomplices may be untrustworthy.  But this can be said of many other
categories of witnesses.  There is nothing inherent in the evidence of an
accomplice which automatically renders him untrustworthy . . . . Rather than
attempting to pigeon-hole a witness into a category and then recite a
ritualistic incantation, the trial judge might better direct his mind to the
facts of the case, and thoroughly examine all the factors which might impair
the worth of a particular witness.  If, in his judgment, the credit of the
witness is such that the jury should be cautioned, then he may instruct
accordingly.

 

    Dickson
J., however, added the following admonition at p. 831:

 

It does
not, however, always follow that the presiding justice may always simply turn
the jury loose upon the evidence without any assisting analysis as to whether
or not a prudent finder of fact can find confirmation somewhere in the mass of
evidence of the evidence of a witness.  Because of the infinite range of
circumstance which will arise in the criminal trial process it is not sensible
to attempt to compress into a rule, a formula, or a direction the concept of
the need for prudent scrutiny of the testimony of any witness.  What may be
appropriate, however, in some circumstances, is a clear and sharp warning to
attract the attention of the juror to the risks of adopting, without more, the
evidence of the witness.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    In
the special circumstances of this case I am of the opinion that such a warning
ought to have been given.  The testimony of King was clearly a key element of
the case against the appellant.  The verdict of first degree murder indicates
that the jury accepted at least part of King's testimony as to Hayes'
involvement in the robbery and murder.

 

    As
well, King was implicated by Hayes in the killing and, indeed, King was also
facing a charge of first degree murder.  The risk of King's untrustworthiness
coupled with the pivotal role of his testimony make a warning particularly
appropriate in this case.  If the clear and sharp warning is ever required to
be given I can think of no clearer case than this one.

 

    Admittedly,
the jury was aware that King was also facing a murder charge relating to the
death of Foster.  As well, the trial judge in the course of his charge to the
jury noted that often when two persons are involved in a criminal activity they
will attempt to place the blame on the other.  However, in my opinion these
remarks about the possibility that persons in the position of the appellant and
King may try to shield themselves from blame does not constitute a clear and
sharp warning about the dangers of acting upon the evidence of King.  Although
this Court will generally not interfere with the exercise of the trial judge's
discretion in warning about the untrustworthiness of accomplices, failure to do
so may amount to a miscarriage of justice in some circumstances.

 

    The
Appeal Division of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court held that, even if there were
a failure to deliver a clear and sharp warning to the jury relating to King's
evidence, the curative provision, s. 613(1) (b)(iii),
of the Code could be invoked.  In my opinion, following this
Court's decision in Vetrovec, supra, I am
not prepared to say that in any given case a warning is required as a rule of
law and that failure to provide such a warning attracts the provisions of
s. 613(1) (a)(iii).  Such failure may, however, in some cases amount
to a miscarriage of justice.

 

    In
assessing whether or not there has been a miscarriage of justice both the
failure to properly charge the jury and the incomplete record of the
proceedings by virtue of the gap in the transcript must be considered.  In the
unique and special circumstances of this case, while neither of the two grounds
individually might have been sufficient to warrant a new trial, cumulatively
they create an appearance of a failure of justice.

 

    Accordingly,
applying s. 613(1) (a)(iii), I would allow the appeal and direct a new trial.

    A
man was brutally murdered as a result of a petty dispute which arose when a
cheque used to pay for a $100 car stereo bounced.  The stereo had been
purchased from Nygaard by Meeks and was paid for by a cheque signed by two
friends.  Nygaard arrived at Meeks' room accompanied by two men.  One of
the men struck Meeks several times on the forehead with a baseball bat and
broke his arm which was raised to protect his face.  The man, later identified
as Schimmens, then asked who had signed the cheque and proceeded to attack him
viciously with the bat.  The victim died at hospital of multiple skull
fractures.  Schimmens and Nygaard were charged with murder under
s. 212 (a)(ii) of the Criminal Code : 
Schimmens was alleged to have meant to cause bodily harm knowing it could
likely cause death and was reckless as to whether or not death would ensue and
Nygaard was alleged to be a party to the offence.  They were convicted of first
degree murder pursuant to s. 214(2)  which requires that the murder be
planned and deliberate.

 

    Nygaard
called no evidence.  His position was that he was not ""a party"" to
the offence within the meaning of s. 21 of the Code.  The
Crown's case against Schimmens was primarily based on the testimony which
identified him.  Schimmens' defence was an alibi supported by two
witnesses.  One of these witnesses gave testimony when confronted with
excerpts from intercepted conversations, which conflicted with earlier
testimony.  The result was that the witness' credibility was seriously damaged
and the alibi defence devastated.  The Crown successfully argued that the use
of the wiretaps related only to the witness' credibility and that Schimmens was
never cross‑examined with regard to the intercepted conversations. 
The Court of Appeal found the use of the wiretap evidence to be lawful and
upheld appellants' convictions.

 

    Two
issues were raised here.  First, is the element of planning and deliberation
required by s. 214(2)  of the Criminal Code 
incompatible with the requisite mens rea for s. 212 (a)(ii)? 
Secondly, did the trial judge make a reversible error when he permitted Crown
counsel to cross‑examine a witness upon statements made by her in an
intercepted telephone conversation when the provisions of s. 178.16 of the Code had not
first been complied with?

 

    Held
(L'Heureux-Dubé J. dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed.

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and Lamer, Wilson, Sopinka and Cory JJ.:  Section 214 is purely a
classification section for sentencing purposes and does not create a separate
substantive offence.  The element of planning and deliberation justifies the
harsher sentence.  The term ""planned"" means that the scheme was
conceived and carefully thought out before it was executed, and
""deliberate"" means considered, not impulsive.

 

    A
first degree murder conviction can be sustained by virtue of the combined
operation of s. 214(2)  and s. 212 (a)(ii). 
The essential element of s. 212 (a)(ii) is
the intention to cause bodily harm of such a grave and serious nature that the
accused knew that it was likely to result in the death of the victim.  The
aspect of recklessness is almost an afterthought in so far as the basic intent
is concerned:  it is the attitude of one who is aware of the danger the
prohibited conduct could bring about and yet persists in that conduct despite
the knowledge of the risk.  The infliction of terrible bodily harm that will
likely result in death can be planned and deliberate; continuing and persisting
in that conduct despite the knowledge of the risk must be a part of that
planning and deliberation.  Nothing is added to the aspect of planning and deliberation
by the requirement that the fatal assault be carried out in a reckless manner. 
The difference in the mens rea where the intent was to cause death
and where the intent was to cause bodily harm knowing death could ensue was too
slight to be taken into account.

 

    The
interception of private communications is an offence unless made either with
consent of a participant in the conversation or in accordance with the
procedure set out in the Code.  Neither participant here consented
to the wiretap, no voir dire was held to determine if the
interception had been made in accordance with the Code's
procedures and the defence had not been informed that the evidence would be
used.  The evidence ostensibly was not being used against an originator
(Schimmens) in that it was being used to impeach the credibility of a witness. 
In fact, however, it was being used against the originator Schimmens to destroy
his alibi defence.  The Crown was attempting to do indirectly what it could not
do directly and to allow such a procedure could result in widespread abuse and
a fundamental unfairness to accused persons.

 

    This
was not a proper case to invoke the saving provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii). 
The conversations might have been readily admitted if a voir dire had
been held but it was impossible to determine that in the absence of such a voir dire.  To
assume their admissibility would be to assume without any evidence that the
requirements of the Code had been complied with.

 

    A
new trial was ordered for both Schimmens and Nygaard in order to obviate a
situation where Schimmens, the prime mover of the crime, might be found guilty
of second degree murder at the second trial while Nygaard, a party to the
offence, had been found guilty of first degree murder at the first.

 

    Per La
Forest, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ.:  The reasons of Cory and L'Heureux‑Dubé
JJ. were agreed with on the first issue.

 

    ""Admissible
as evidence"" is a term of art in the law of evidence which designates
putting evidence on which the jury can rely in its deliberations into the
record.  Cross‑examination on a prior statement does not make that
statement evidence.  A statement may become evidence if the person who made it
admitted making it and acknowledged that it was true as happened here.

 

    When
a witness under cross‑examination admits making certain statements, it is
that testimony and not the intercepted communication to which the Act is
directed that becomes evidence.  Section 178.16(1) is confined to the admission
in evidence of intercepted private communications in the hands of the Crown. 
The Crown, however, cannot introduce unlawfully obtained intercepted statements
indirectly by questioning witnesses on them.  Considerations of fairness
suggest that intercepted statements governed by s. 178  of the Criminal
Code  should be treated in the same manner as
confessions.  The statement is inadmissible until the Crown proves the
conditions of its admissibility.

 

    Per
L'Heureux‑Dubé J. (dissenting):  Section 178.16 is an attempt to strike a
delicate balance between the goal of protecting individuals from unwanted
electronic surveillance and the desire for effective law enforcement.  When the
section speaks of the inadmissibility of evidence, these words should not be
extended so as to exclude other possible uses of intercepted communications.

 

    Section
178.16 clearly applies only to intercepted communications which the Crown might
seek to adduce as evidence.  The wording is explicit and precise as the word
""evidence"" is a term of art in criminal law.  Section 178.16 does not
therefore encompass the use of intercepted private communications for the sole
purpose of testing the credibility of a witness in cross‑examination.

    The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and Lamer, Wilson, Sopinka and Cory JJ. was delivered
by

 

    CORY J. --
Two issues are raised on this appeal.  First, it must be determined whether a
first degree murder conviction can be based upon the combined effect of ss. 212(a)(ii)
and 214(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34.  That is to say, is the element of planning and deliberation required by
s. 214(2) incompatible with the requisite mens rea for s.
212(a)(ii).  Secondly, it must be decided whether a
reversible error was made by the trial judge when he permitted Crown counsel to
cross-examine a witness upon statements made by her in an intercepted telephone
conversation with the appellant Schimmens, without first complying with the
provisions of s. 178.16 of the Code.

 

Factual
Background

 

    A
man was brutally murdered as a result of a petty dispute arising out of the
purchase of a $100 car stereo.  Early in October of 1984, John Louis Meeks
purchased from the appellant Nygaard, a car stereo for $100.  Payment was made
by means of a cheque which had been jointly signed by Anita Linda Tikk and the
murdered man, Renne Tex Hammond.  Both Anita Tikk and Renne Hammond were
present at the time of the purchase of the stereo.  The cheque bounced.  Around
9 o'clock in the morning of October 12, 1984, Nygaard came to see Meeks where
he was living at the West Valley Inn motel about a mile outside the Calgary
city limits.  Nygaard told him the cheque had bounced.  Meeks promised him that
he would have the money by that evening.  Nygaard stated that if it wasn't
cleared up that day, Meeks could expect trouble.

 

    Some
time later that day Meeks met with Anita Tikk and Renne Hammond.   They rented
some video cassettes and took them back to the West Valley Inn to watch them. 
Just before 6:00 p.m. there was a knock on the door of Meeks' room.  It was
Nygaard.  Meeks testified that he gave him the $100 in cash.  Just then two
other men came walking up to the door.  They asked:  ""Are you fucking with
the bros?""   One of them started to hit Meeks on the forehead with a
baseball bat.  Meeks was moved backwards into the room and onto the bed and was
struck three more times with the bat.  At one point he put his arm in front of
his face for protection and received another blow from the bat, which broke his
arm.

 

    The
man wielding the bat kept asking who had signed the cheque. Anita Tikk gave
evidence that Meeks told the men that it was Hammond, while Meeks testified
that it was Hammond himself who volunteered this information.  The man with the
bat then started to hit Hammond between the eyes with the bat.  He struck him
three times, each time with a full two-handed swing, all the while saying such
things as: ""You don't stiff the club.  You don't hurt the club.""   At
this point one of the men, Tikk thought it was Nygaard, Meeks thought it was
Schimmens, took money from Tikk's purse and from Hammond.  Nygaard then went
over to pick up the video cassette recorder but the other man told him to leave
it there, that they weren't petty thieves.  On the way out the men warned the
three people in the room: ""If you tell anyone, we'll come back,"" and
""if you tell anyone, you're dead.""  The man with the bat disconnected
the phone by ripping out the cord.

 

    Some
15 or 20 minutes after the men had left Anita Tikk, Meeks and Hammond went to
the hospital.  Hammond was described as being in a semi-conscious state at this
time.  He could only walk if supported by someone else.  At the hospital, Meeks
and Tikk advised the staff that Meeks and Hammond had fallen off a roof. 
Meeks' broken arm was treated and he was released.  Hammond died in the
hospital as a result of multiple skull fractures.  Tikk went to the police to
advise them of the incident the following day and later during the week Meeks
did the same thing.

 

    The
Crown's case was primarily based on the testimony of Meeks and Anita Tikk. 
Their evidence was largely consistent but they did differ with regard to the
appearance of the man who swung the bat with such devastating results.  Both
witnesses gave a similar description as to the height and eye colour of the
man.  Anita Tikk picked out both Nygaard and Schimmens from photograph folders
at the police station after the incident.  She also picked them out in a
line-up the following day.  Meeks did not identify Schimmens from the
photograph folders but did pick him out at the line-up.

 

    Nygaard
and Schimmens were arrested on October 13 at premises that were shared by
Schimmens and his girlfriend Glenda Jordan.  A baseball bat with human blood on
it was found in the seat of the couch in their suite.

 

    At
the trial Nygaard called no evidence.  His position was that he was not ""a
party"" to the offence within the meaning of s. 21  of the Criminal
Code .  Schimmens testified at the trial and called two
witnesses, Brian Sager and Glenda Jordan.  His defence was that of alibi.  He
said he had driven Jordan to the race-track where she worked and had attended
the races with Sager.

 

    During
cross-examination Glenda Jordan stated that she never really discussed the case
with Schimmens after his arrest despite the fact that she had seen him three or
four times a week and talked with him on the phone every day.  She specifically
denied that Schimmens had asked her to get a transcript of the preliminary
hearing, to read it, and then deliver it to Sager.  As well she denied ever
having read the transcript.  Her evidence was that 10 minutes before the second
race -- which would have been between 5:45 and 5:55 p.m. -- she had seen
Schimmens at the races.  This of course would be the very time when he was
alleged to have been at the motel when the fatal injuries were inflicted upon
Hammond.

 

    Crown
counsel persisted in his questioning of Jordan and read her specific portions
of conversations that had taken place between Jordan and Schimmens and Jordan
and a third party, James Wolton.  Jordan eventually broke down and admitted
that she had been lying.  She confirmed she had indeed discussed with Schimmens
the reading of the preliminary hearing transcripts by herself, Sager and another
witness.

 

    At
this point an objection was taken by the defence counsel that the Crown was
using the conversations in contravention of s. 178.16  of the  Criminal
Code .  The objection was overruled.  Crown counsel continued
with the cross-examination at which point Jordan admitted that she had read
part of the preliminary inquiry transcript and that Sager had read the whole
transcript.  At the conclusion of her cross-examination she did repeat that
Schimmens had been at the race-track at the critical time.  The Crown has
conceded that the conversations were intercepted and recorded by means of an
electronic surveillance but emphasized that Schimmens was never cross-examined
with regard to the intercepted conversations.

 

The
Courts Below

 

    In
his charge to the jury the trial judge made it plain that a conviction for
first degree murder could be sustained on the basis of the interaction between
s. 214(2) and either ss. 212(a)(i) or 212(a)(ii).  

 

    On
the issue of the cross-examination's making use of the intercepted
conversations the Court of Appeal (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 199, was unanimous in
its view that s. 178.16  had no application to the case because the
conversations were not being used either against ""the originator""
Jordan or against James Wolton, whom the court took to be the intended
receiver, neither of whom was on trial.  The court agreed that the Crown
counsel was justified in cross-examining on the intercepted conversations as he
was doing no more than interrogating the witness Jordan on her prior
inconsistent statement.  It determined that since s. 178.16  had no application
the trial judge was not obliged to hold a voir dire to
prove the lawfulness of the interception before the intercepted conversation
could be used in cross-examination.  The court observed that the jury had been
properly instructed as to the limited use which could be made of the
statement.  That is to say, that it could only be used in assessing the
credibility of the witness and that it was not evidence as to the truth of the
facts referred to in the statements themselves.

 

    With
regard to the verdict, Belzil J.A., for the majority, expressed the view that a
conviction of first degree murder could properly result from the interaction of
s. 212(a)(ii) and s. 214(2) .  He observed that there are two
mental elements included in s. 212(a)(ii), namely the
intent to cause bodily harm which one knows is likely to cause death, and
recklessness as to whether death ensues.  He was of the opinion that
recklessness as to the consequences was not part of the intention but was an
alternative to the intention to kill.  He stated that the planning and
deliberation required by s. 214(2)  of the Criminal Code  referred
only to the intentional portion of the mens rea
requirement.  He concluded that it is only the intent to cause bodily harm
which one knows is likely to result in death which must be premeditated
pursuant to s. 214(2)  and not the recklessness referred to in s. 212 (a)(ii). 
Thus if a jury were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the intent to
cause bodily harm which the accused knew was likely to cause death was planned
and deliberate and the planned act was then recklessly carried out, a first
degree murder conviction could properly result.

 

    Stevenson
J.A. dissented on this point.  He agreed with the majority that there are two
mental elements required by s. 212(a)(ii), namely the
intent to cause bodily harm that the accused knew was likely to cause death,
and recklessness as to the consequences, but in his opinion s. 214(2)  could not
be brought into play.  He expressed the view that planning and deliberation
could not be applicable to the requisite mental element for recklessness.  He
concluded that if the planning and deliberation could not apply to all of the
mental elements set forth in s. 212(a)(ii),
there could be no possibility of a first degree murder conviction by means of
s. 214(2) .  He therefore would have substituted convictions for second degree
murder.

 

The
First Degree Murder Issue

 

    It
may be helpful to set forth at the outset the applicable sections of the Criminal
Code :

 

                            212. 
Culpable homicide is murder

 

    (a) where the person who causes the death of a human being

 

(i)  means to cause his death, or

 

(ii)  means to cause him bodily harm that he knows is
likely to cause his death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not; ...

 

    214. . . .

 

    (2) 
Murder is first degree murder when it is planned and deliberate.

 

    It must
be noted that this Court has stated on more than one occasion that s. 214 is
purely a classification section and it does not create a separate substantive
offence.  See R. v. Farrant, [1983] 1 S.C.R.
124; Droste v. The Queen, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 208.  The designation
of murder as being of the first or second degree is for purposes of sentencing
only.

 

    What
then is the meaning of planned and deliberate and can that classification be
applied to the requisite intents set forth in s. 212(a)(ii)? 
It has been held that ""planned"" means that the scheme was conceived
and carefully thought out before it was carried out and ""deliberate""
means considered, not impulsive.  A classic instruction to a jury as to the
meaning of ""planned and deliberate"" was given by Gale J., as he then
was, in R. v. Widdifield (1961), Ontario Supreme Court, unreported, as excerpted
in 6 Crim. L.Q. 152, at p. 153:

 

    I think that in the Code ""planned"" is to
be assigned, I think, its natural meaning of a calculated scheme or design
which has been carefully thought out, and the nature and consequences of which
have been considered and weighed.  But that does not mean, of course, to say
that the plan need be a complicated one.  It may be a very simple one, and the
simpler it is perhaps the easier it is to formulate.

 

    The important element, it seems to me, so far as
time is concerned, is the time involved in developing the plan, not the time
between the development of the plan and the doing of the act.  One can
carefully prepare a plan and immediately it is prepared set out to do the
planned act, or, alternatively, you can wait an appreciable time to do it once
it has been formed.

 

    As
far as the word ""deliberate"" is concerned, I think that the Code
means that it should also carry its natural meaning of ""considered,""
""not impulsive,"" ""slow in deciding,"" ""cautious,""
implying that the accused must take time to weigh the advantages and
disadvantages of his intended action.

 

Appellants'
Positions

 

    The
appellants contended that the element of planning and deliberation cannot be
applied to the mens rea required by s. 212(a)(ii). 
In support of this position the case of R. v. Ancio, [1984]
1 S.C.R. 225, was cited. 

    In R. v.
Ancio this Court considered the requisite mental elements of
the offence of attempted murder.  It is true that in the course of his reasons
given on behalf of the Court, McIntyre J. wrote at pp. 248-49:

 

The
completed offence of murder involves a killing.  The intention to commit the
complete offence of murder must therefore include an intention to kill.  I find
it impossible to conclude that a person may intend to commit the unintentional
killings described in ss. 212 and 213 of the Code.  I am
then of the view that the mens rea for an attempted murder cannot be less
than the specific intent to kill.

 

    However
he emphasized that the reasons related only to the crime of attempted murder
which is historically and conceptually distinct from that of murder.  At page
240 McIntyre J. stated:

 

    A
great deal of the confusion surrounding the nature of the intent required to
found a conviction for attempted murder may well stem from an assumption that
murder and attempted murder are related offences which must share the same
mental elements.  A brief review of the historical development of the law
relating to the two offences demonstrates that the crime of attempt developed
as a separate and distinct offence from the offence of murder.

 

    He
concluded at pp. 250-51 that:

 

    It
was argued, and it has been suggested in some of the cases and academic
writings on the question, that it is illogical to insist upon a higher degree
of mens rea for attempted murder, while accepting a lower degree
amounting to recklessness for murder.  I see no merit in this argument.  The
intent to kill is the highest intent in murder and there is no reason in logic
why an attempt to murder, aimed at the completion of the full crime of murder,
should have any lesser intent.  If there is any illogic in this matter, it is
in the statutory characterization of unintentional killing as murder.  The mens rea for
attempted murder is, in my view, the specific intent to kill.

 

    It
is thus clear that the reasons refer only to the offence of attempted murder
and the principles set forth are not automatically applicable to the case at
bar.

 

    Nor
do I think that the case of R. v. Chabot (1985), 16 C.C.C.
(3d) 483, relied upon by the appellants is of assistance.  In R. v.
Chabot the Ontario Court of Appeal concluded that s. 214(2) 
could not operate in conjunction with s. 212(c).  That
section provides as follows:

 

    212.  Culpable homicide is murder

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

(c) where
a person, for an unlawful object, does anything that he knows or ought to know
is likely to cause death, and thereby causes death to a human being,
notwithstanding that he desires to effect his object without causing death or
bodily harm to any human being.

 

    The
Court of Appeal reasoned, I think correctly, that in s. 212(c) murder
might be committed although there could be no intention on the part of the
accused to kill.  Indeed, in that section the accused might well have desired
to gain his ends without causing death.  Thus it was held that there could not
be planning and deliberation of a killing that might well have been
unintended.  The reasoning cannot be applied to the case at bar though as the
requisite intent specified in s. 212(a)(ii) is
very different from that of s. 212(c).

 

Authority
Relied upon by the Respondent

 

    Nor
do I think that Droste v. The Queen, supra, relied
upon by the respondent is dispositive of the issue.  In the Droste case
there could be no doubt that the accused had planned to kill his wife and,
while carrying out his design, had killed instead his two unfortunate young
children.  His conviction was based on s. 212(b) which
reads:

 

    212.  Culpable homicide is murder

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

(b)  where a person, meaning to cause death to a human
being or meaning to cause him bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause his
death, and being reckless whether death ensues or not, by accident or mistake
causes death to another human being, notwithstanding that he does not mean to
cause death or bodily harm to that human being; . . .

 

    The
decision centred on the requirements of a different section than those of the
case at bar.  In Droste v. The Queen, the issue was
whether the planning and deliberation to kill A which resulted in the killing
of B should be classified as murder in the first degree.  It was found that the
requirement of planning and deliberation was a requirement that related to the
intention to take a human life and not to the identity of the victim.  On the
facts of that case there could be no doubt that Droste meant to cause death to
a human being and planned and deliberated the death of a human being.  In the
result,  Dickson J. (as he then was) writing on behalf of the Court concluded
that s. 214(2)  could operate in conjunction with s. 212(b) to
sustain a first degree murder conviction.  However, that decision centred on
requirements of a section of the Code that are different
from s. 212(a)(ii).  The Droste decision cannot be
determinative of the issue in the case at bar.

 

Can Section 212(a)(ii) be Combined
with s. 214(2)  to Result in a Conviction for First Degree Murder?

 

    Throughout
history the idea that one human being could cold bloodedly plan and deliberate
upon the killing of another has been repugnant to all civilized societies and
has tended to be considered as the most reprehensible of violent crimes.  In Droste v.
The Queen, supra, Dickson C.J. noted that it is the
element of planning and deliberation of the murder which makes the crime of
murder in the first degree more culpable and justifies the harsher sentence.

 

    It
remains then to consider what is the specific mens rea
required by s. 212(a)(ii) to which the element of planning and deliberation
must be related.  The section requires that the Crown prove that the accused
meant to cause the victim such bodily harm that he knew that it was likely to
cause the death of the victim and was reckless whether death ensued or not as a
result of causing that bodily harm.  The essential element is that of intending
to cause bodily harm of such a grave and serious nature that the accused knew
that it was likely to result in the death of the victim.  The aspect of
recklessness is almost an afterthought in so far as the basic intent is
concerned.

 

    In Sansregret
v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 570, recklessness was defined as being
the attitude of one who was aware of the danger the prohibited conduct could
bring about yet nevertheless persisted in that conduct despite the knowledge of
the risk.  Thus the section requires the accused to intend to cause the gravest
of bodily harm that is so dangerous and serious that he knows it is likely to
result in death and to persist in that conduct despite the knowledge of the
risk.

 

    In
my view, the vital element of the requisite intent is that of causing such
bodily harm that the perpetrator knows that it is likely to cause death and yet
persists in the assault.  There can be no doubt that a person can plan and
deliberate to cause terrible bodily harm that he knows is likely to result in
death.  Nothing is added to the aspect of planning and deliberation by the
requirement that the fatal assault be carried out in a reckless manner, that is
to say by heedlessly proceeding with the deadly assault in the face of the
knowledge of the obvious risks.  The planning and deliberation to cause the
bodily harm which is likely to be fatal must of necessity include the planning
and deliberating to continue and to persist in that conduct despite the
knowledge of the risk.  The element of recklessness does not exist in a vacuum
as a sole mens rea requirement, but rather it must act
in conjunction with the intentional infliction of terrible bodily harm.  I
therefore conclude that planning and deliberation may well be coupled with the mens rea
requirement of s. 212(a)(ii) and that a first degree murder conviction can be
sustained by virtue of the combined operation of s. 214(2)  and s. 212 (a)(ii). 
This ground of appeal must therefore fail.

 

    As
well, the appellant argued it was wrong to label an offence under s. 212(a)(ii) as
murder.  It was said that the requisite mens rea is such
that it is not as grave a crime as that defined in s. 212(a)(i)
where the requisite intent is to cause the death of someone.  I cannot accept
that contention.  The variation in the degree of culpability is too slight to
take into account.  Let us consider the gravity of the crime described by s.
212(a)(ii) in the light of three examples which, pursuant to
the section, would be murder.  First an accused forms the intent to inflict
multiple stab wounds in the abdomen and chest of a person knowing that the
wounds are likely to kill the victim and, heedless of the known probable
result, proceeds with the stabbing.  Second, an accused forms the intent to
shoot a former associate in the chest knowing that death is likely to ensue
and, uncaring of the result, shoots the victim in the chest.  Third, two
accused form the intent to repeatedly and viciously strike a person in the head
with a baseball bat realizing full well that the victim will probably die as a
result.  Nonetheless they continue with the bone-splintering, skull-shattering
assault.  The accused in all these examples must have committed as grave a
crime as the accused who specifically intends to kill.  Society would, I think,
find the drawing of any differentiation in the degree of culpability an
exercise in futility.  The difference in the calibration on the scale of
culpability is too minute to merit a distinction.  I would conclude that the
crime defined in s. 212(a)(ii) can properly be described as murder and on a
""culpability scale"" it varies so little from s. 212(a)(i) as
to be indistinguishable.

 

    I
find some support for this position in R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987]
2 S.C.R. 636.  There Lamer J., giving the reasons for the Court, stated at pp.
644-45:

 

There is a very interesting progression through s. 212
to s. 213 with respect to the mental state that must be proven.

 

    The starting point is s. 212(a)(i) . .
. .

 

This clearly requires that the accused have actual
subjective foresight of the likelihood of causing the death coupled with the
intention to cause that death.  This is the most morally blameworthy state of
mind in our system.

 

    There is a slight relaxation of this requirement in
s. 212(a)(ii) ....  

    Here
again the accused must have actual subjective foresight of the likelihood of
death.  However, the Crown need no longer prove that he intended to cause the
death but only that he was reckless whether death ensued or not.  It should
also be noted that s. 212(a)(ii) is limited to cases where the accused intended to
cause bodily harm to the victim.

 

    He
went on to note, at pp. 645-46, that there is still a greater relaxation of the
requisite mental element in s. 212(c), a provision
which ""eliminates the requirement of actual subjective foresight and
replaces it with objective foreseeability or negligence"".  It is clear
from these observations that the Court in that case concluded that there was
but a slight relaxation of the requisite intent in s. 212(a)(ii)
from that required by s. 212(a)(i).  Section 
212(a)(ii) demands a highly subjective mental element to be
present, that of the intent to cause the gravest of bodily injuries that are
known to the accused to be likely to cause death to the victim.  It is to this
intent that the s. 214(2)  requirement of planning and deliberation can be
properly applied.

 

The
Wiretap Issue

 

    This
issue arises out of the cross-examination of the defence witness Jordan by
Crown counsel.  It was the Crown's position that Schimmens, during his time at
the detention centre, had concocted an alibi for his defence and orchestrated
the compliance of friends in supporting this alibi.  The cross-examination of
Jordan, who was Schimmens' girlfriend, was based upon five intercepted
telephone calls.  From the transcript it is clear that Crown counsel became
specific in his interrogation and read to Jordan verbatim from portions of the
transcript of the intercepted conversations.  Although the Alberta Court of
Appeal held that s. 178.16  of the Criminal Code  did not
apply, it based this finding on a mistaken belief that the conversations were
between Jordan and one James Wolton.  Neither Wolton nor Jordan were accused
parties before the Court.  However, four of those five conversations (the vital
conversations) were instead between Jordan and the accused Schimmens.  It was
these four conversations which pertained to the plan to read and circulate the
preliminary hearing transcripts.  It was the presentation of these
conversations to Jordan which caused her to admit she had lied in her earlier
testimony.  They were thus seriously damaging to her credibility and to the
alibi defence.  For the purposes of these reasons I need only deal with the
conversations between Jordan and Schimmens.

 

    Section
178.16  of the Criminal Code , subss. (1) and
(4), reads as follows:

 

    178.16 (1)  A private communication that has
been intercepted is inadmissible as evidence against the originator of the
communication or the person intended by the originator to receive it unless

 

(a) the interception was lawfully made, or

 

(b) the originator thereof or the person intended by the
originator to receive it has expressly consented to the admission thereof;

 

but evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result
of information acquired by interception of a private communication is not
inadmissible by reason only that the private communication is itself
inadmissible as evidence.

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

    (4) A private communication that has been lawfully
intercepted shall not be received in evidence unless the party intending to
adduce it has given to the accused reasonable notice of his intention together
with

 

(a) a transcript of the private communication, where it
will be adduced in the form of a recording, or a statement setting forth full
particulars of the private communication, where evidence of the private
communication will be given viva voce; and

 

(b) a
statement respecting the time, place and date of the private communication and
the parties thereto, if known.

 

    These
provisions are contained in Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code  which
is entitled ""Invasion of Privacy"" and subtitled ""Interception of
Communications"".  These titles in themselves support the position that the
purpose of this part of the Criminal Code  is to protect the
natural interest of all individuals in their privacy.  These provisions have
made the interception of private communications an offence unless they are made
either with consent of a participant in the conversation or in accordance with
the procedure set out in the Criminal Code .  In the case at
bar no notice was given to Schimmens of the Crown's intention to use the
intercepted conversations.  Nor had there been a voir dire in
order that the judge might determine whether the interception had been lawfully
made as required by Charette v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R.
785.

 

    The
respondent Crown argued that there was no need to prove that the interception
was lawfully made, as it was not intended to use it ""against the
originator"" Schimmens but rather to impeach the credibility of the witness
Jordan.  Yet the Crown was doing far more than impeaching the credibility
Jordan pursuant to s. 11  of the Canada Evidence Act,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5 .  The intercepted conversation was, in fact, being used
against the originator Schimmens to destroy his alibi defence.  It was the
words of Schimmens and Jordan's replies to Schimmens that were read to her. 
The effect of the cross-examination with the intercepted conversations on the
defence alibi was devastating.  It led the trial judge in his charge to the
jury to put forward the theory that the defence witnesses had lied under oath
because they had been concocting the alibi story and to make the suggestion
that the jury might consider the fabrication of evidence by an accused as a
circumstance from which they could infer consciousness of guilt, although he
emphasized it would not be conclusive evidence of guilt.

 

    The
effect of Jordan's cross-examination by means of the intercepted communications
went far beyond an attack upon the credibility of the witness. In reality they
were used as evidence against the accused in contravention of s. 178.16(4). 
Schimmens was the originator of the most damaging conversations and it was the
content of those conversations which was used to rebut his sole defence of
alibi.  The use of the intercepted conversations in this way contravened the
provisions of s. 178.16(4).

 

    This
was the view expressed by David Watt (now Watt J.) in his text Law of
Electronic Surveillance in Canada.  At page 298 he wrote:

 

    An
issue may perhaps arise in the case of primary evidence being used for
testimonial impeachment as to whether the receivability of the primary evidence
need be shown where it is not being used in a substantive way.  The provisions
of section 178.16  do not distinguish between primary evidence used to advance
the prosecution's case in a substantive way and that used to incidentally
advance it by impeaching the testimonial reliability of the accused as a
defence witness.  The distinction is, in reality, one of form not of substance
and it would accord more with the spirit of the legislation to require proof of
the lawfulness of the interception as well as proof of the fact that the
alleged statement was made.

 

    If
the Crown were permitted to use the conversations in the manner suggested in
this case, it would permit the Crown to do indirectly what it is prohibited
from doing directly.  To allow such a procedure could result in widespread
abuse and a fundamental unfairness to accused persons.

 

    The
introduction, in the absence of the procedural safeguards provided by the Criminal
Code , of the intercepted conversations between the witness
Jordan and the appellant Schimmens during the cross-examination of Jordan was
improper.

 

    I
must as well reject the Crown's contention that this is a proper case to invoke
the saving provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii).  Although
it may well be true that the conversations would have been readily admitted had
a voir dire been held, it is impossible to determine that in the
absence of such a voir dire.  To assume their admissibility would
be to assume without any evidence that the requirements of the Criminal
Code  had been complied with.

 

    Since
the voir dire was not held and the Court cannot presume its result,
the case must be considered without the evidence of the intercepted
conversations.  In those circumstances the Crown cannot meet the requisite
standards to warrant the implementation of s. 613(1)(b)(iii). 
The Crown would have to satisfy the Court that in the absence of any reference
in the evidence to the intercepted communications, the verdict would
necessarily have been the same.  It has been decided that when exculpatory
evidence has been improperly excluded then any reasonable effect that exclusion
may have had on the jury should, in considering the subsection, enure to the
benefit of the accused.  See Wildman v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R.
311.  The same principle must apply to inculpatory evidence that was improperly
included.  When that principle is applied to this case it becomes apparent that
the Crown cannot meet the test.

 

    In
the circumstances, a new trial must be directed not only for the appellant
Schimmens, but also for Nygaard.

 

    It
seems unfortunate that Nygaard too must have a new trial yet it appears to be
the inescapable result.  It is true that the erroneously admitted evidence
affects only Schimmens in his alibi defence.  Even if it led the jury to a
reasonable doubt as to the guilt of Schimmens and his acquittal, the
unchallenged fact remains that Hammond was battered to death with a baseball
bat in the presence of Nygaard by someone who arrived with Nygaard.  Nor does
the alibi evidence of Schimmens affect the jury's conclusion in the first trial
that Nygaard was a party to the murder committed by whoever it was that swung
the baseball bat.  The jury was carefully and properly instructed with regard
to Nygaard's position as a party and this is not contested.

 

    Nevertheless,
on a new trial the evidence then adduced might lead a jury to a conclusion that
the killing amounted to murder in the second degree and not first degree.  If
Nygaard did not also have a new trial, the incongruous and unacceptable result
might be that Schimmens, the prime mover in the crime, was found guilty of
second degree murder while Nygaard, the party to the crime, was found guilty of
murder in the first degree.

 

    In
the result, I would set aside the convictions and direct a new trial of both
appellants.

 

//McLachlin
J.//

 

    The
reasons of La Forest, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. were delivered by

 

    MCLACHLIN J. -- I
have had the benefit of reading the reasons of
Justices L'Heureux-Dubé and Cory.   I agree with their views on
the first issue.

 

    While
I agree with Cory J. in the result on the second issue, I reach that conclusion
by a different route.   Section 178.16  (now s. 189) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, provides:

 

    178.16 (1)   A private communication that
has been intercepted is inadmissible as evidence against the originator of the
communication or the person intended by the originator to receive it unless

 

(a) the interception was lawfully made; or

 

(b) the originator thereof or the person intended by the
originator to receive it has expressly consented to the admission thereof;

 

but
evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of information acquired by
interception of a private communication is not inadmissible by reason only that
the private communication is itself inadmissible as evidence.

 

    I
share the view of L'Heureux-Dubé J. that ""admissible as evidence"" is
a term of art in the law of evidence.  It designates the putting of evidence
into the record -- evidence which the jury can rely on in making its
conclusions.   Cross-examination on a prior statement does not make that
statement evidence.

 

    That
is not to say that the statement does not become evidence if it is proved.  One
way of proving the statement is by the witness' acknowledging that she made the
statement and stating that it is true.   McWilliams, Canadian Criminal
Evidence, at p. 629, summarizes the law as follows:

 

    A witness who is cross-examined as to a previous
inconsistent statement may: (1) admit that he made the statement and that it is
true; (2) admit that he made the statement but deny its truth . . . ; (3) deny
that he made the statement . . . .

 

    It
is only in the first situation that the statement comes within the testimonial
response and becomes evidence against the accused as to the truth of the
facts therein . . . .  [Emphasis added.]

 

    In
this case we have the first situation referred to by McWilliams. The witness
acknowledged that she had the telephone conversation and admitted her
statements were true.  It would seem, therefore, that her statements were
admitted as evidence.

 

    This
is not the end of the matter, however.  When the witness under
cross-examination admitted that she had made certain statements, it was not the
intercepted communication to which the Act is directed that became evidence,
but her testimony.  Section 178.16(1) is confined to the admission in
evidence of intercepted private communications.  Its purpose is to prevent
the Crown from tendering as evidence private communications which have been
unlawfully intercepted.  Its purpose was not to prevent witnesses from giving
evidence about conversations in which they took part, merely because they may
have been intercepted by the police.  An intercepted private communication
under s. 178.16(1) is a private communication which is in the hands of the
Crown as a result of an interception.  I agree with L'Heureux-Dubé J. that s.
178.16(1) was never intended to apply to defence witnesses giving evidence about
conversations in which they participated.

 

    Extending
s. 178.16(1) to all evidence about statements that may happen to have been
intercepted would produce anomalous results.   While  the accused would still
be able to give evidence of prior statements in his own defence by expressly
consenting to their admission, the use of the word ""consent"" hardly
seems apt to describe such a process.   More seriously, what of a case where a
defence witness gives evidence of a conversation, unaware that the Crown has intercepted
it?   In such circumstances the accused would be unaware of the need to
expressly consent to the statement being introduced, with the result that it
would be inadmissible.   Moreover, since the only prohibition is on the
admission of evidence, a defence witness could be cross-examined on his or her
statement without violating the section, but could not state that he made the
statement or that it was true.   These awkward results are avoided if s.
178.16(1) is confined to intercepted communications in the hands of the Crown.

 

    What
then is the result?  Is the Crown to be allowed to introduce unlawfully
obtained intercepted statements indirectly by questioning witnesses on them? 
As Cory J. points out, that would seem not only anomalous, but unfair.

 

    In
my opinion, the answer to this question is governed by a principle that stands
independent of s. 178.16(1)  of the Criminal Code .  I am
of the view that the intercepted statement should not have been referred to in
cross-examination without the Crown's first establishing that the statement was
lawfully obtained.   The authorities establish that Crown cross-examination of
defence witnesses must be based on admissible evidence:  McWilliams, op. cit., at
p. 500, quoting Donnelly v. The King (1947), 89 C.C.C.
237 (N.B.C.A.):

 

    But
whether the evidence submitted in direct or on cross-examination is for the
purpose of impugning the character or the credibility of a witness, the nature
of such evidence must be such that it is admissible under the rules of evidence;
and the manner of bringing it out must be in accord with the rules of fair
practice, and not in violation or derogation of the right of witnesses or
accused persons.

 

    For
this reason, a witness generally cannot be cross-examined on a confession that
has not been proved voluntary.  McWilliams, op. cit., states
at p. 627:

 

    It
is improper for counsel to cross-examine a witness regarding a confession which
has not been ruled voluntary and a fortiori one which has been
ruled involuntary:  Monette v. The Queen (1956), 114 C.C.C.
363 (S.C.C.);  Hebert v. The Queen (1954), 113 C.C.C.
97 (S.C.C.), per Cartwright, J. (dissenting); R. v. Treacy (1944),
30 Cr. App. R. 93.

 

    This
applies to cross-examination of the accused on confessions not proved to be
voluntary: R. v. Treacy (1944), 30 Cr.
App. R. 93; Hebert v. The Queen, [1955] S.C.R.
120.   More closely parallel to this case, it also applies to cross-examination
of defence witnesses other than the accused on confessions made to the witness
that have not been proved to be voluntary and admissible: R. v.
Lanigan (1984), 53 N.B.R. (2d) 388 (C.A.)

 

    The
rule does not extend to cross-examination by an accused on a confession made by
his or her co-accused.   Different considerations prevail there because of the
need to guarantee the co-accused a full and fair trial and not deprive him or
her of legitimate defences:  Lui Mei Lin v. The Queen, [1989] 1 A.C. 288
(P.C.)

 

    In
summary, the fundamental consideration governing cross-examination on prior
statements in a criminal trial is fairness.  The law recognizes that it would
be unfair to permit the Crown to introduce inadmissible statements against an
accused by the device of questioning defence witnesses on them in
cross-examination.  For this reason, the cases hold that the Crown must show
the statements to be admissible before embarking on such cross-examination.  On
the other hand, where cross-examination is necessary to afford an accused a
fair trial, it is permitted.

 

    Considerations
of fairness suggest that intercepted statements governed by Part IV.1 of the Criminal
Code  should be treated in the same manner as confessions for
purposes of Crown cross-examination of defence witnesses.    In each case, the
statement is inadmissible until the Crown proves the conditions of its
admissibility -- in the case of confessions, voluntariness, in the case of
intercepted statements, compliance with the conditions laid down by the Criminal
Code .  In each case, to permit the Crown to question defence
witnesses on the statement without requiring the Crown to first establish its
admissibility would be, as my colleague Cory J. points out, to permit the Crown
to do indirectly what it cannot do directly.  Evidence which might be
inadmissible under exclusionary rules based on policy or fairness, might
nevertheless be taken into consideration by the jury, and no amount of careful
instruction by the judge as to the use to which the evidence may be put could
ensure that it would not become part of their perception of the case.   In the
case of intercepted private communications, just as in the case of confessions,
fairness requires that the Crown establish the admissibility of statements it
seeks to use against the accused before putting them to defence witnesses in
cross-examination.

 

    The
logic of extending the rule governing the use of confessions in
cross-examination by the Crown to other prima facie
inadmissible statements is recognized by May, Criminal Evidence, s.
8-86, who, after setting out the rules governing cross-examination on
confessions, including the rule that a defendant may not be cross-examined on
an inadmissible confession, concludes:  ""The same rules apply to any other
inadmissible statement made by a defendant."" 

 

    In
this case, the Crown cross-examined a defence witness on a statement, the
admissibility of which had not been established.  The Crown was thus allowed to
put before the jury and use against the accused a statement that s. 178.16(1) 
of the Criminal Code  made inadmissible against the accused without proof
that it had been lawfully obtained.  This was unfair and on the authorities
should not have been permitted.

 

    I
agree with Cory J. that although the use of the intercepted statements affected
only Schimmens in his alibi defence, to allow only Schimmens' appeal might lead
to incongruous results.

 

    I
would set aside the convictions and direct a new trial of both appellants.

 

//L'Heureux-Dubé//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    L'HEUREUX-DUBÉ J.
(dissenting)  -- The appellants raise two issues in this appeal.  While I am in
agreement with my colleague Justice Cory as to the disposition of the first
issue concerning the construction of ss. 212(a)(ii) and
214(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, with deference, I cannot agree with his disposition of the second issue
raised.

 

    This
issue concerns the proper interpretation of s. 178.16  (now s. 189) of the Criminal
Code .  Section 178.16 (1)  provides:

 

    178.16 (1)  A private communication that has
been intercepted is inadmissible as evidence against the originator of
the communication or the person intended by the originator to receive it unless

 

(a)  the interception was lawfully made; or

 

(b)  the originator thereof or the person intended by the
originator to receive it has expressly consented to the admission thereof;

 

but
evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of information acquired by
interception of a private communication is not inadmissible by reason only that
the private communication is itself inadmissible as evidence.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

    I
note at the outset that no constitutional challenge is at issue here as regards
s. 178.16  of the Criminal Code .

 

    The
title of Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code , in which s.
178.16  (now s. 189 ) can be found, is ""Invasion of Privacy"".  The
right to privacy is of crucial importance in our society, and should be
ardently protected by the courts.  There are many legal tools which are
available to help protect an individual from unwarranted invasions of privacy. 
These tools range from the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  to
private law remedies.  Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code  is only
one of a range of possible protections.  It is aimed at one particular aspect
of the problem of invasion of privacy:  electronic surveillance for the
purposes of crime detection.  As such, it is a specific tool, designed for a
specific goal.

 

    This
specific goal is described as a balancing of objectives by Zuber J.A. of the
Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Welsh (1977), 32 C.C.C.
(2d) 363, at p. 369:

 

It is apparent that in enacting the Protection
of Privacy Act, 1973-74 (Can.), c. 50, now Part IV.1 of the Code,
Parliament had two objectives.  The first was to protect private communications
by prohibiting interception and to render inadmissible evidence obtained in
violation of the statute.  The second objective, which balances the first, was
to recognize the need to allow the appropriate authorities, subject to specific
controls, to intercept private communications in the investigation of serious
crime, and to adduce the evidence thus obtained.

 

    This
legislation must be viewed and interpreted with a full, fair and realistic
appreciation of both these objectives.  The right to private communication
cannot be diluted simply because unlawful interceptions are made by honest men
whose motives are simply to detect crime.  On the other hand, this legislation
is not a legal briar patch calculated to frustrate the legitimate aims of the
prosecution.

 

    I
agree.  The goal of  protecting individuals from unwanted electronic
surveillance is often at cross-purposes with the desire for effective law
enforcement in an increasingly sophisticated technological age.  As a result,
an often delicate balance must be struck between the two aims.  In my view, one
must assume that the legislature, in enacting the ""Invasion of
Privacy"" provisions of the Criminal Code , was
establishing the balance it desired.  It is my view that the proper role of the
courts is to interpret the provisions in a manner which gives full effect to
the legislative intent.  When s. 178.16 speaks of the inadmissibility of
evidence, these words should not be extended so as to exclude other possible
uses of intercepted communications.

 

    In
my view, s. 178.16 clearly applies only to intercepted communications which the
Crown might seek to adduce as evidence.  The wording is explicit.  The word
""evidence"" is a term of art in criminal law.  It cannot be supposed
that Parliament was unaware of either the meaning of this term or the
implications of its use within s. 178.16.  As a result, s. 178.16 cannot be
said to include the use of intercepted private communications for the sole
purpose of testing the credibility of a witness such as Jordan in
cross-examination in the circumstances of this case.

 

    In
the present case Glenda Jordan was called as a witness by the accused Schimmens
at the trial of Nygaard and Schimmens.  Jordan was the live-in girlfriend of
Schimmens.  Her testimony was crucial to Schimmens' alibi defence.  This
defence was based on the claim by Jordan that she saw him at the race-track
where she worked at roughly the same time that the assault on the victim
Hammond occurred across town.  Schimmens' alibi was also supported by testimony
from one Brian Sager who claimed to have been with Schimmens at the track at
the relevant time.  It was the Crown's theory that the alibi was false, and was
orchestrated by Schimmens from the Remand Centre where he was detained.

 

    In
cross-examination, the Crown sought to destroy the credibility of Jordan as
Schimmens' chief alibi witness.  To this end, it made use of prior inconsistent
statements made by Jordan.  These were aimed primarily at determining whether
she was following instructions from Schimmens with respect to her testimony,
and whether she had obtained a copy of the transcript of the preliminary
inquiry and used it to instruct Sager.  None of the prior inconsistent
statements used by the Crown contained actual contradictory information
regarding Jordan's claim to have seen Schimmens at the race-track at the time
of the murder.  Thus the cross-examination did not directly disprove the
alibi.  However, the use of the conflicting statements by the Crown led Jordan
to admit to having lied in certain portions of her testimony, and in particular
to having followed instructions from Schimmens concerning her own testimony and
the briefing of Sager.  Needless to say, the use of the prior inconsistent
statements had a devastating effect on Jordan's credibility as a witness.

 

    The
controversy over the use of these statements relates to their source.  The
statements were contained in transcripts of a recorded telephone conversation
between Jordan and an individual named James Wolton, and in three separate
telephone conversations between Jordan and Schimmens.  The appellants argue
that the statements were inadmissible since it was never established that the
interceptions were lawful pursuant to s. 178.16  of the Criminal
Code .

 

    An
objection to the use of these statements was made at trial.  The following discussion
took place in the absence of the jury:

 

THE COURT:  Yes, Mr. MacPherson.

 

Mr. MacPHERSON:  Thank you, My Lord.  It appears that my
learned friend is introducing evidence of an interception of a private
communication.  In my respectful submission, would that not bring into play the
provision of Sections [sic] 178 of the Criminal Code ?

 

MR. MARTIN:  I at this point in these proceedings am
cross-examining the witness with respect to a previous oral inconsistent
statement pursuant to Section 11  of the Canada Evidence Act .  My respectful
submission is that if she agrees she makes these statements, how they came into
my possession is completely irrelevant.  It's not evidence, it's just been
cross-examining her going to the issue of her credibility.

 

MR. MacPHERSON:  Well, it certainly is indeed evidence
in my respectful submission, My Lord, and I appreciate the point that my
learned friend is making.  What he is doing in effect is introducing evidence
of an interception of a private communication.  In my respectful submission
then Section 178  comes into play.

 

MR. MARTIN:  Just so we're clear here, I'm not
introducing any evidence at this point.  I'm asking the witness if she recalls
saying these statements which are inconsistent with her current evidence.

 

THE COURT:  Which part of 178.16 are you speaking; that
it's inadmissible in evidence?

 

MR. MacPHERSON:  Yes, Sir.

 

THE COURT:   1(a).  That's your total submission?

 

MR. MacPHERSON:  Yes, Sir, 178.16(1),

 

""A private communication that has been intercepted
is inadmissible as evidence against the originator of the communication or the
person intended by the originator to receive it unless""

 

And it goes onto (a) and (b).  Unless ""the
interception was lawfully made,"" or (b) ""the originator thereof or
the person intended by the originator to receive it has expressly consented to
the admission thereof.""

 

THE COURT:  Well, as Mr. Martin says, he's not
introducing the interception as evidence.  He's merely attempting to refresh
the memory of this particular witness, and it appears to be refreshing her
memory.

 

MR. MacPHERSON:  What he is doing, My Lord, in my
respectful submission, is reading directly from the communication that was
made.

 

THE COURT:  No question he is, but it's still not being
introduced as evidence.  It's not evidence unless she adopts it or does not
adopt it.

 

MR. MacPHERSON:  Well, if she adopts it, My Lord --
let's say for the sake of argument she adopts it, then does it not come
squarely within Section 178 ?

 

THE COURT:  As I understand it, the transcript is not
being tendered.  It's her viva voce evidence after her memory has been
refreshed that is being put before the jury.

 

MR. MacPHERSON:   Well, in my respectful submission, My
Lord, none of it is admissible because of the prohibition in Section 178 .

 

THE
COURT:  We will continue.  Jury, please.   [Emphasis added.]

 

    There
is nothing to indicate that the statements were illegally obtained.  In fact,
the Crown submits in its factum that the proper judicial authorization had been
obtained for the interceptions.  The controversy in this case is over the trial
judge's decision that proof of their legality need not be tendered at this
stage under the circumstances.

 

    The
issue of whether the Crown should have been permitted to use these statements
in the cross-examination of Jordan was raised on appeal to the Court of Appeal
of Alberta (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 199.  Belzil J.A., for the majority, made the
following remarks at p. 203:

 

While
the Crown was aware of the contents of these intercepted conversations from
transcripts in its possession, it did not seek to introduce them as evidence
against the ""originator"", Jordan, or the ""intended
receiver"", Wolton, neither of whom were on trial; it only sought to
cross-examine the witness on her prior inconsistent statements.  Hence the
exclusionary rule in s. 178.16  had no application and the trial judge did not
err in ruling that the Crown was not required to prove the lawfulness of the
interceptions before using them for cross-examination.  The jury were never
told that the Crown had obtained these prior inconsistent statements by
interception of private telephone conversations.  As far as the jury were
concerned, these were simply prior inconsistent statements made by the witness.

 

    The
appellants argue that the decision of Belzil J.A. with respect to the
intercepted phone conversations is erroneous because he appeared to be under
the impression that the conversations in question were only between Jordan and
Wolton.  It is clear from the transcripts of the trial that the Crown also made
use of intercepted conversations between Jordan and Schimmens.  The appellants
argue that this fact invalidates the reasoning behind the Court of Appeal's dismissal
of that ground of appeal.   However, in my view this does not affect the
overall finding of the Court of Appeal.  The more important point to be drawn
from the above cited passage is that the Crown did not seek to introduce the
conversations as evidence, and used them only in the cross-examination of the
witness Jordan.

 

    The
Crown made use of the previous inconsistent statements pursuant to s. 11  of the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5 , which reads:

 

    11.  Where
a witness, on cross-examination as to a former statement made by him relative
to the subject-matter of the case and inconsistent with his present testimony,
does not distinctly admit that he did make the statement, proof may be given
that he did in fact make it, but before that proof can be given the
circumstances of the supposed statement, sufficient to designate the particular
occasion, shall be mentioned to the witness, and he shall be asked whether or
not he did make the statement.

 

    The
proper procedure under this section is explained by Professor Bryant in
""The Adversary's Witness:  Cross-Examination and Proof of Prior
Inconsistent Statements"" (1984), 62 Can. Bar Rev. 43, at
pp. 60-61:

 

It
requires counsel to ask the witness whether he did make such and such a
statement.  In order that the witness may adequately respond to this question,
counsel must first identify the circumstances and the occasion of the making of
the former statement so that the witness has an opportunity to recall it.  As a
minimum, counsel should advise the witness of ""the time, place and persons
involved in the supposed contradiction"" together with the particulars of
the statement.  If these suggestions do not refresh the witness's memory,
counsel may read the pertinent parts of the alleged statement to the witness. 
In the event the witness ""distinctly admits"" that he made that
statement or that part, there is no need to independently prove the
contradiction.

 

    The
procedure outlined above was followed by Crown counsel in the present case. 
Since Jordan ultimately admitted that she had made the statements in question,
there was no need for the Crown to make independent proof of the statements.

 

    The
following excerpts from the transcript of the trial serve as an illustration
both of the procedure followed by the Crown and the admission of Jordan that
she had made the inconsistent statements:

 

Q.That conversation took place at 1:25 I suggest to you,
on the afternoon of March 5.  About an hour later, Miss Jordan, about an hour
later that same day, did Mr. Schimmens phone back and ask you once you said
hello, did he say, ""Did they make it?"" meaning Guy Chittick and Brian
Sager, and you said, ""Yeah"", and he said, ""Are they both
there?"" And you said, ""Both of them.  Do you want to talk to
them?"" And he said, ""Yeah"".  And he then spoke to Guy Chittick. 
Do you remember that?  Let me keep reading then.  After he spoke to Guy
Chittick, he spoke to Brian Sager, and then -- incidentally, you would have
been present while he was speaking to Sager, and Sager at that time was at page
20 of the transcript.  And then you got back on the phone, and he said, that is
John Schimmens said to you, ""So, what's happening babes?"" And you said,
""Notin.  I'm watching Another World.""  John said, ""Hmm."" 
You said, ""They're doing their thing,"" meaning Chittick and Sager are
reading the transcript, and John said, ""Uh hmm.  Well, says he figures
it'll take him a couple of days to read that.  It shouldn't take that
long.""  You say, ""At the most.""  John says, ""A couple of
hours.""  You say, ""Yes.""  John says, ""Steady reading.  Want
some copies?""  You say, ""Huh?""  He says, ""Copy?""  You
say, ""Yeah.""  Does that refresh your memory?

 

A.Yes.

 

Q.That did happen, didn't it?

 

A.Yes.

 

Q.And Miss Jordan, you lied to us here under oath this
morning when you said that to your knowledge Brian Sager had not read that
transcript?

 

A.At the time I couldn't remember, but he did.

 

Q.You didn't remember?  You paid the man who dropped him
off at your house.  You paid him $10.

 

A.Mmm hmm.

 

Q.You lied to us this morning when you said John hadn't
arranged that, didn't you?

 

A.Yup.

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

Q.That last conversation I read you, that took place at
2:16 in the afternoon on March 5.  So, the first call was at 1:25 to tell you
he would be over, at 2:16 to ask if he'd come yet and how far he'd gotten, at
3:09 the third call that afternoon March 5 between John Schimmens and you.  He
says to you jokingly, ""Is this the Jordan residence?""  And you say,
""Yeah.""  And he says, ""Okay.""  And you say,
""Oh.""  And John Schimmens says to you, ""Still reading
that?"" meaning is Sager still reading the transcript, and you say,
""Yeah"".  He says, ""Oh.""  And you say, ""He's in the
bedroom.""  ""Yeah"", meaning Brian Sager was in the bedroom
reading the transcript of the preliminary inquiry; is that right?

 

A.I can't remember if he was in the bedroom.  He might
have been in the bedroom.

 

Q. You remember this conversation.  What?

 

A. Sure,
yup.

 

    What
was ""proven"" by the Crown in cross-examination was not the content of
the earlier statements made by the witness Jordan.  Rather, it was the simple
fact that contradictory statements had been made by that witness. Jordan's
subsequent admissions that she lied to the jury, and her explanations of the
circumstances of her deceit formed a part of her testimony at trial.  Neither
the fact that the Crown proved that she had contradicted herself, nor Jordan's
own testimony relating to the phone conversations necessarily imply that the
intercepted communications became evidence in the trial pursuant to the terms
of s. 178.16  of the Criminal Code .

 

    In R. v. Gamble
and Nichols (1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 415, the Alberta Supreme Court,
Appellate Division, was faced with a situation where one of the accused was
cross-examined as to an intercepted private communication which had previously
been ruled inadmissible.  In dismissing the appellant's appeal on this point
Sinclair J.A. for the Court observed at pp. 424-25:

 

    Finally,
before leaving the point, I cannot see how Part IV.1 of the Code can be
interpreted as prohibiting the recipient of a private communication from
testifying as to the contents of that communication.

 

    I
agree.  There was nothing in the Criminal Code  to stop
Glenda Jordan from testifying as to her previous conversations with the accused
Schimmens or with Wolton, whether they were intercepted or not.  Had she been
questioned, for example, about a prior conversation with a neighbour, her own
testimony concerning that conversation would form an incontestable part of the
record.  The hearsay nature of the conversation and the fact that it may have
been private are immaterial once the witness decides to give testimony in
relation to the conversation.  Under such circumstances, the means by which the
Crown has been made aware of the existence of a prior communication are
immaterial.  It is only when the witness denies the existence of the previous
conversation that the Crown must take steps to prove it.

 

    When,
as in the present case, the intended and actual recipient of the intercepted
communication chooses to testify as to the content of the communication, it
would be paradoxical indeed if such person were prohibited from talking about
her own previous conversations on the ground that her privacy was being
protected.

 

    Since
writing these reasons, I have had the advantage of taking cognizance of the
reasons of my colleague, Justice McLachlin.  Upon further reflection, I tend to
agree with her that the best approach in the interest of fairness to the
accused, an argument not raised by counsel before us, would be for judges to
hold a prior voir dire on the admissibility of the
intercepted conversation on which the prosecution relies and wishes to question
a witness, whether or not it is then formally tendered in evidence.

 

    However,
since in the present case it is now known that the intercepted conversation in
question was made with prior judicial authorization, I see no point in ordering
a new trial.  In my view, such a result would not be in the best interest of
the administration of justice.

 

    I
would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

R.S.C. 1970, c. F‑27, s. 37(1)(a),(b).

 

    A
reliable informant informed the police that the appellant and two others were
going to meet to complete an illegal drug deal and take delivery of substantial
amount of speed being brought into the area by a supplier.  The informant had
obtained this information in conversation with one of the persons who was to be
a party to the deal.  All the individuals named were known by the police to
have had an involvement with drugs in the past.

 

    Two
officers, on orders from an R.C.M.P. sergeant, intercepted and searched
appellant's vehicle shortly after it left the house where the transaction was
to occur.  A constable told appellant that he had reasonable and probable
grounds to believe that the appellant had speed on him and proceeded with a
warrantless search as authorized by s. 37(1)  of the Food and
Drugs Act .  The appellant was ordered to assume a ""spread
eagle"" position and told to empty his pockets.  A quantity of speed
was found.  The constable placed the appellant under arrest and advised him of
his Charter  right to counsel.

 

    The
trial judge acquitted the accused.  He found the search to be unreasonable contrary
to s. 8  of the Charter  and excluded the evidence under
s. 24(2) .  The Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the Crown's appeal and
ordered a new trial.  The circumstances of the search raised Charter  issues
as to the reasonableness of the search under s. 8 , the right to counsel
under s. 10 (b), and the exclusion of evidence under s. 24(2) .

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and Lamer and Cory JJ.:  The right to search incident to arrest derives
from the fact of arrest or detention of the person.  The right to retain and
instruct counsel derives from the arrest and detention, not from the fact of
being searched.  The detainee, therefore, has the right to be informed of the
right to retain and instruct counsel immediately upon detention.  The police,
however, are not obligated to suspend the search incident to arrest until the
detainee has the opportunity to retain counsel.

 

    Denial
of the right to counsel will result in a search's being unreasonable contrary
to s. 8  of the Charter  in only exceptional
circumstances.  A search is reasonable if it is authorized by law, if the
law itself is reasonable and if the manner in which the search was carried out
is reasonable.  The denial of the right to counsel does not affect the ""manner""
in which the search is conducted.  The ""manner"" in which the search
is conducted relates to the physical way in which it is carried out and should
not be inclusive of restrictions of other rights that already receive the
benefit of the Charter 's protection.

 

    Evidence
obtained by way of a search that is reasonable but contemporaneous with a
violation of s. 10 (b) of the Charter  will not
necessarily be admitted under s. 24(2) .  Evidence will be excluded if
there was a temporal link between the infringement of the Charter  and the
discovery of the evidence, and if the admission of the evidence would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute.

 

    Here,
the ""frisk"" search authorized by s. 37  of the Food and
Drugs Act  was carried out contemporaneously to a violation of
appellant's s. 10 (b) rights under the Charter .  The
evidence obtained, however, was real evidence and its existence was totally
unrelated to the Charter  violation.  The repute of
administration of justice would not be harmed by the admission of this
evidence.

 

    Per Wilson
J.:  A search will be reasonable if it is authorized by law, if the law itself
is reasonable, and if the manner in which the search was carried out is
reasonable.  No question was raised as to whether s. 37  of the Food and
Drugs Act  was, either by necessary implication or through its
operating requirements, irreconcilable with s. 8  or s. 10 (b) of the Charter  so as
to constitute limits on those rights ""prescribed by law"" under
s. 1 .  The appellant's Charter  rights therefore had to be respected.

 

    When
police officers order someone to stand ""spread eagle"" against a wall,
that person is ""detained"" within the meaning of s. 10 .  In light
of the fact that the arresting officers were instructed in advance to stop and
search the vehicle and its occupants, the appellant was detained from the time
he was approached by the constable.

 

    Counsel's
role is not limited to advising a suspect of his or her options where such
options exist.  The suspect is entitled to know what his legal rights and
obligations are and to have counsel available to dispel uncertainty and provide
assurance to the suspect that the officers do have the authority they are
seeking to assert.  The right to counsel is not contingent on a hypothetical assessment
of whether or not counsel would be useful to the suspect in the circumstances.

 

    The
direction in s. 10 (b) that the police inform a detainee of his or her rights
to counsel ""without delay"" does not permit of internal
qualification.  Any limit on the right to counsel, other than the limit
required for the safety of the police, must be supported under s. 1  of the Charter  if it
is a limit ""prescribed by law"" which was not the case here.

 

    The
police had reasonable and probable grounds to search the appellant under the
authority granted to them under s. 37  of the Food and Drugs Act .  The
appropriate standard is one of ""reasonable probability"" rather than
""proof beyond a reasonable doubt"" or ""prima facie
case"".  The phrase ""reasonable belief"" also approximates the
requisite standard.

 

    The
police officer who decides that a suspect should be searched is the person who
must have reasonable and probable grounds for believing the suspect is committing
an offence.  That officer may or may not perform the actual search.  If another
officer conducts the search, he or she is entitled to assume that the officer
who ordered the search had reasonable and probable grounds for doing so.

 

    At
least three concerns must be addressed in weighing whether or not the evidence
relied on by the police justified a warrantless search.  First, was the
information predicting the commission of a criminal offence compelling? 
Second, where a ""tip"" originating from a source outside the police,
was that source credible?  Finally, was the information corroborated by police
investigation prior to making the decision to conduct the search?  Each factor
does not form a separate test.  Rather, it is the ""totality of the circumstances""
that must meet the standard of reasonableness.  Weaknesses in one area
may, to some extent, be compensated by strengths in the other two.

 

    The
information received by the police was compelling.  It was sufficiently
specific to warrant their attention and did not take the form of bald
conclusory statements or ""mere rumour or gossip"".  Two caveats,
however, must qualify the use of reputation as germane to the issue of a
reasonable search.  First, the reputation of the suspect must be related to the
ostensible reasons for the search.  And second, if the reputation of the
suspect is based on hearsay rather than police familiarity with the suspect,
its veracity cannot be assumed.  The police here appear to have relied on both
direct experience and hearsay.

 

    The
informant whose credibility is most critical is the one who provided the
details of the anticipated transaction.  The evidence of previous dealings with
the informant in this case tended to validate the decision to treat the
informant as credible.  Where the police rely on an anonymous tip or on an
untried informant, the quality of the information and corroborative evidence
may have to be such as to compensate for the inability to assess the
credibility of the source.

 

    The
police need not confirm each detail in an informant's tip so long as the
sequence of events actually observed conforms sufficiently to the anticipated
pattern to remove the possibility of innocent coincidence.  The level of
verification required, however, may be higher where the police rely on an
informant whose credibility cannot be assessed or where fewer details are
provided and the risk of innocent coincidence is greater.  Given the quality of
the information and the reliability of the informant, the police surveillance
yielded sufficient corroborative evidence to warrant the belief that a drug
transaction had occurred.

 

    A
detained person cannot be assumed to be fully apprised of all his Charter  rights
at the critical moment and, without knowledge of those rights, may fail to exercise
his rights or may attempt to resist in a mistaken belief that the police
conduct was not lawful when in fact it was.  The police cannot
appropriately provide legal advice regarding the legitimacy of their own
actions.  An individual must rely on counsel to supply the vital
information.

 

    The
question of whether a denial of the right to counsel renders a search
unreasonable depends on two factors:  (1) the source of authority for the
search; and, (2) the invasiveness of the search.  The failure to advise an
individual of his or her right to counsel detracts more from the reasonableness
of a warrantless search than from a search subject to prior authorization.  The
more invasive the search, the greater the assault on one's dignity.  To the
extent that counsel can provide reassurance and advice to a person who may be
subjected to a highly invasive procedure and perhaps even prevent an
unjustified search, his or her presence can mitigate the impact of the
intrusion on the individual's physical and psychological integrity.  Here, the
failure to accord the appellant his s. 10 (b) rights
militated against the reasonableness of the warrantless search and the minimal
nature of the invasion of his privacy from the ""frisk"" type search
militated in favour of its reasonableness.

 

    The
evidence should be admitted notwithstanding the Charter 
violation.  The search following the violation of appellant's s. 10 (b) rights
produced real evidence which was totally unrelated to the Charter 
violation.  Its admission would not render the trial unfair.  The police had
not acted in bad faith in thinking that respondent did not have to be informed
of his s. 10 (b) rights before being searched.  The violation of
appellant's right was not trivial but the ""interests of truth"" and
the ""integrity of the legal system"" would be better served by the
admission of the evidence than by its exclusion.

 

    Per Sopinka
J.:  The police were under no obligation to advise the appellant of his right
to counsel before completing the ""frisk"" search.  Where the
obligation to inform a person of his or her right to counsel arises, there is
an obligation to afford that person a reasonable opportunity to consult
counsel.  If the circumstances surrounding a search incidental to an arrest do
not lend themselves to the delay inherent in making counsel available, they are
equally not conducive to the reading of rights.  This Court has recognized
that the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay is not absolute. 
The right to be informed of the right to counsel need not be accorded different
treatment.

//Lamer J.//

 

    The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and Lamer and Cory JJ. was delivered by

 

    LAMER J. -- I
have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleague Justice Wilson. 
While I agree with her reasons and disposition of this appeal, I feel I must,
with respect, qualify somewhat my concurrence, as regards two matters:  first,
the relationship between the right to search incident to arrest and the right
to retain and instruct counsel and second, the effect of a violation of the
right to counsel on the constitutional validity of an otherwise reasonable
search made contemporaneously with arrest.

 

    On
the first point, I note that as a general rule police proceeding to a search
are not obligated to suspend the search and give a person the opportunity to
retain and instruct counsel, as for example when the search is of a home
pursuant to a search warrant.  When the police are conducting a body search,
however, the matter is entirely different.  In such a case, it is impossible to
search without detaining the individual within the meaning of s. 10  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  It is in that
context that I now turn to a discussion of searches incident to arrest.

 

    The
right to search incident to arrest derives from the fact of arrest or detention
of the person.  The right to retain and instruct counsel derives from the
arrest or detention, not from the fact of being searched.  Therefore
immediately upon detention, the detainee does have the right to be informed of
the right to retain and instruct counsel.  However, the police are not
obligated to suspend the search incident to arrest until the detainee has the
opportunity to retain counsel.  There are, in my view, exceptions to this general
rule.  One is where the lawfulness of the search is dependent on the detainee's
consent.  That situation is governed by this Court's decision in R. v. Ross, [1989]
1 S.C.R. 3, at p. 12:

 

    In
my view, the right to counsel also means that, once an accused or detained
person has asserted that right, the police cannot, in any way, compel the
detainee or accused person to make a decision or participate in a process which
could ultimately have an adverse effect in the conduct of an eventual trial
until that person has had a reasonable opportunity to exercise that right.

 

Another
is when a statute gives a person a right to seek review of the decision to
search as was the case in R. v. Simmons, [1988] 2 S.C.R.
495.  In this case, when the person invokes the right, and pending its
exercise, the authority to proceed to search is suspended.  Obviously, the
person must be given the same rights as when arrested, and the officers wanting
to search cannot assume that they may proceed absent the suspect's invoking his
right to review, until he or she has been given reasonable opportunity to
consult counsel.

 

    This
then leads me to the second point.  It is Wilson J.'s view that a denial of a
right to counsel should be a factor when determining the reasonableness of a
search.  With respect, I cannot agree with such a broad statement in relation
to the interaction of ss. 8  and 10 (b) of the Charter .  It is
my view that it will only be in exceptional circumstances that the denial of
the right to counsel will trigger a violation of s. 8 .  Such would be the case
when the lawfulness of the search is dependent upon the consent of the person
detained.  If a detained person's consent to a search of his house, which,
under the circumstances of the case and the applicable law, requires a warrant,
was given while that person's s. 10 (b) rights
were being violated (either because he has not been informed of his right to
counsel or because the police have obtained his consent to search his house
before he has been given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to
counsel) then  the search is unlawful and, as such, unreasonable.  Apart from a
situation such as this or other situations analogous to those dealt with in R. v.
Simmons, supra, where the s. 10 (b)
violation goes to the very lawfulness of the search, I have not been able to
imagine situations where the right to counsel will be relevant to a
determination of the reasonableness of a search.

 

    In
respect of the right to protection against unreasonable search or seizure, the
norm to be applied in considering reasonableness was set out by this Court in R. v.
Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 278:

 

    A
search will be reasonable if it is authorized by law, if the law itself is
reasonable and if the manner in which the search was carried out is reasonable.

 

    In
subsequent decisions, namely R. v. Simmons, supra, R. v.
Strachan, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 980, R. v. Jacoy, [1988]
2 S.C.R. 548, and in the present case, Wilson J. has stated that the
denial of the right to counsel affects the ""manner"" in which the
search is conducted.  With respect, I cannot agree.  The ""manner"" in
which the search is conducted relates to the physical way in which it is
carried out and should not, in my view, be inclusive of restrictions of other
rights that already receive the benefit of protection from the Charter .

 

    I
hasten to add that I am not saying that evidence obtained by way of a  search
which is reasonable but contemporaneous with a s. 10 (b) violation
will necessarily be admitted.  Once a restriction of the right to counsel has
been established, the court must turn to the effects of the restriction under
s. 24(2)  and apply the two-fold test set out in R. v. Strachan, supra, at p.
1000:

 

(i)  the evidence must be ""obtained in a manner
that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed"" by the Charter .

 

(ii) the
admission of the evidence ""would bring the administration justice into
disrepute"".

 

    The
above discussion is far from theoretical.  Indeed, determining the exclusion or
admission of evidence obtained as a result of an unreasonable search is quite
different from determining the exclusion or admission of evidence obtained as a
result of a search which was perfectly valid but which was carried out
contemporaneously with a s. 10 (b) violation.  While
the violation of s. 8  is directly linked to the obtaining of the evidence, the
violation of s. 10  could be very remote:  indeed it could be totally unrelated
to the finding of the evidence.  For example, in this case the appellant was
subjected to a warrantless ""frisk"" search authorized by s. 37  of the Food and
Drugs Act .  The search was carried out contemporaneous to a
violation of the appellant's s. 10 (b) rights
under the Charter .  But as Wilson J. notes in her
discussion of s. 24(2)  in this case, the evidence obtained was real
evidence the existence of which, and I hasten to add its seizure, was totally
unrelated to the Charter  violation.  This link, or in this
case the lack of it, of course makes a great difference when assessing whether
the repute of our system of justice will be harmed by the admission of the
evidence.

 

    I,
therefore, agree with Wilson J.'s disposition of this appeal, save for the
comments I have made above.

 

//Wilson J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    WILSON J. --
The appellant was charged on an indictment alleging:

 

    That
he on or about the 26th day of February, 1985 at the Town of Wallaceburg in the
County of Kent unlawfully did have in his possession a Controlled Drug to wit: 
Methamphetamine (Speed) for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to Section
34(2) of the Food and Drug Act.

 

    The
drugs in question were discovered on the appellant's person in the course of an
on-the-spot warrantless ""frisk"" search.  Section 37(1) of the Food and
Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-27 as amended, in force at the
relevant time, authorized a warrantless search in the following circumstances:

 

37. (1)  A peace officer may at any time

 

(a) without a warrant enter and search any place other
than a dwelling-house, and under the authority of a writ of assistance or a
warrant issued under this section, enter and search any dwelling-house in which
he reasonably believes there is a controlled drug by means of or in respect of
which an offence under this Part has been committed;

 

(b) search
any person found in such place; . . .

 

 

    The
circumstances of the search raise Charter  issues as to the 
reasonableness of the search under s. 8 , the right to counsel under s. 10 (b), and
the exclusion of evidence under s. 24(2) .  The appeal also provides the Court
with an opportunity to explore further the effect of a violation of the right
to counsel on the constitutionality of the search under s. 8 .

 

1.  The
Facts

 

    On
February 26, 1985, Constable Gutteridge, a Joint Forces Officer with the
Chatham police and the R.C.M.P., received confidential information from an
informant that the appellant and two others, Greg Carpenter and Gerry List,
were going to meet that evening for the purpose of completing a drug
transaction involving around four ounces of speed.  The transaction was to take
place at Carpenter's residence and both he and the appellant were to receive a
substantial amount of the drug.  The speed was being brought into the
Wallaceburg area by a supplier named by the informant.  The informant told
Gutteridge that he had obtained this information in conversation with
Carpenter.  Gutteridge had had at least one previous dealing with this
informant and described him as ""reliable"".  On that occasion the
informant advised him that a large quantity of speed would be found at a
particular residence.  Only trace amounts of speed were found but a larger
quantity of marijuana was seized.

 

    Gutteridge
contacted Sergeant Briscoe, head of the R.C.M.P. detachment in Chatham, and
passed on the information he had received from the informant to him. 
Gutteridge asked that the appellant, Carpenter and List all be put under
surveillance.  All these individuals were known by the Drug Section of the
Chatham police to have had an involvement with drugs in the past.  The police
described the appellant as a user and trafficker although he had only one
narcotics related conviction and that was for possession of a small amount of
marijuana.  Carpenter was also known as a user and trafficker.  Warrants had
been executed under the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
N-1 , and the Food and Drugs Act  on Carpenter's
residence on previous occasions.  He had a lengthy record of convictions for
narcotics related offences.

 

    Sergeant
Briscoe held a briefing session at which the information communicated to him by
Gutteridge was relayed to the officers assigned to the surveillance, including
Constables Birs and L'Heureux.  Birs also testified that he was instructed
earlier in the day directly by Gutteridge.  Gutteridge's testimony is silent on
this point.

 

    Several
officers set up surveillance in the vicinity of Carpenter's residence.   At one
point Constable L'Heureux was instructed to follow a grey Ford compact which
had just left Carpenter's residence.  The car proceeded to a tavern where the
occupants of the car, two men and a woman, parked and entered.  Constables
L'Heureux and Birs observed from a distance what they thought might be a drug
deal taking place between one of the men and another woman in the bar. 
Constable L'Heureux testified that he noticed an exchange of money and
""something else"" which he could not identify.

 

    At
approximately 9:10 p.m. a dark-coloured Ford Bronco arrived at Carpenter's
house.  Gutteridge had seen the same car parked in front of the appellant's
home several months earlier when he executed the search warrant issued under
the Food and Drugs Act  which ultimately led to the appellant's conviction for
possession of marijuana.  Gutteridge had also seen the appellant drive the car
on several occasions.  A number of people got out of the Bronco and at least
one person went into the house.  About five minutes later two men and two women
came out of the house, got into the Bronco, and drove away.  These observations
were transmitted via police radio to Sergeant Briscoe who confirmed that the
Bronco was registered in the appellant's name.  

 

    Sergeant
Briscoe instructed two police cars, one occupied by a Constable Martin and the
other by Constables L'Heureux and Birs, to intercept and search the vehicle a
few minutes after it left Carpenter's residence.  The Bronco had entered the
downtown area at the time it was stopped.  Constable L'Heureux went to the
driver's side of the car and had a conversation with the driver Sandra Murphy. 
She and another female passenger were subsequently searched at the police
station after being advised of their right to counsel.  Constable Birs went
toward the passenger side and approached the appellant who had already stepped
out of the Bronco.  The Constable identified himself and asked the appellant
his name, which the appellant gave.  Constable Birs later testified that he did
not know whether the appellant was in the car or not when he intercepted it. 
He asked the appellant if he was carrying drugs, to which the appellant replied
that he was not.  Constable Birs asked him again and received the same
response.  Birs then told the appellant that he had reasonable and probable
grounds to believe that he had speed on him and proceeded with a search.  The
appellant was ordered to face the wall of a nearby building in a ""spread
eagle"" position and then told to empty his pockets.  The appellant turned
over a wad of money.  Constable Birs discovered a sunglasses case in the
appellant's pocket in which there was a clear plastic bag containing
approximately one ounce of speed.  The Constable then placed the appellant
under arrest and advised him of his Charter  right to counsel. 
As Birs was putting the appellant into the car the appellant apparently
volunteered the information that he had two syringes concealed in his sock and
he produced those for the officer.

 

    A
subsequent search of the Bronco uncovered no additional evidence.  A search
warrant executed on the Carpenter residence also yielded nothing.

 

2.  The
Issues

 

    The
appellant raises the following issues on appeal:

 

(1)  Did the search of the appellant contravene s. 8  of
the Charter ?

 

(2)  Did the police violate the appellant's right to
counsel under s. 10 (b) of the Charter ?

 

(3)  If the appellant's Charter  rights
were violated, is the evidence obtained from the search admissible under s.
24(2)  of the Charter ?

 

    (4) 
Was the search of the appellant incidental to a lawful arrest?

 

The
relevant Charter  provisions are as follows:

 

    8. 
Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.

 

                            10. 
Everyone has the right on arrest or detention

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

(b) to
retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right; . .
.

 

    24. (1) Anyone whose rights or freedoms,
as guaranteed by this Charter , have been infringed or denied may apply to a
court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court considers
appropriate and just in the circumstances.

 

    (2)
Where, in proceedings under subsection (1), a court concludes that evidence was
obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed
by this Charter , the evidence shall be excluded if it is established that,
having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings
would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

 

3.  The
Courts Below

 

District
Court of Ontario  (Clements Dist. Ct. J., unreported)

 

    The
trial judge held that the search of the accused was not incidental to an
arrest, since the search preceded the arrest and one of the officers, Constable
L'Heureux, testified that there was to be no arrest unless drugs were found.

 

    The
trial judge then turned to s. 37  of the Food and Drugs Act  as 
authority for the search.  He referred to this Court's decision in Hunter v.
Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, and noted that Dickson J. (as he
then was) emphasized the need for reasonable and probable grounds as opposed to
mere suspicion in order to render a search reasonable.  The trial judge held
that the search in this case was arbitrary and not based on reasonable and
probable grounds.  He stated:

 

Very
concisely put, it was clear from the evidence of Constable L'Heureux that the
vehicle in which the accused was found was going to be stopped and searched. 
That was that.  It was the only task at hand when that vehicle was stopped. 
Everyone in the vehicle was going to be searched.  The vehicle was going to be
searched.  None of the officers that I have heard from knew if the accused was
in that vehicle.

 

Later he
added:

 

    The
police were not instructed to make an arrest here but merely to search.  This
did take place in a public place.  The question then is whether or not the
search was reasonable.  Certainly, to conduct  the investigation was
reasonable; certainly the surveillance was reasonable as carried on by the
officers.  But knowing what might happen and what had happened to that point,
in my view, the officers went beyond their lawful authority in stopping the
vehicle and searching the accused.  They did not exercise any direct
independent mind of their own to determine whether or not what they were doing
was arbitrary because their instructions, according to Constable L'Heureux,
were very clear.

 

    Clements
Dist. Ct. J. concluded that the search by Constable Birs was unreasonable on
the basis of the following facts.  The courier who was supposed to deliver the
drugs to Wallaceburg was never spotted and there was no evidence that the drugs
had arrived.  The police did not identify the accused as one of the people
entering the house nor as an occupant of the vehicle prior to instructing
Constables Birs and L'Heureux to intercept the vehicle, although it had been
confirmed that the accused owned the Bronco.  The officers were instructed to
search the car and its occupants; they themselves exercised no discretion in
deciding whether to conduct the search or who to search.  It was irrelevant to
such decision who was in the vehicle and what they said.  In this sense the
actions of the police were arbitrary.  Clements Dist. Ct. J. stated:

 

    Against
all that, Constable Birs said that he had reasonable and probable grounds to
search; in my view, he did not have any aside from pure speculation and pure
hope.  If anything, the police jumped the gun.  They should have continued on
their surveillance.  It cannot be said that this was a reasonable search.  In
fact, what can be said, although the police, in my view, were not out to even
the score with the accused, was that their action was arbitrary.

 

    Having
decided that the search contravened s. 8  of the Charter , the
trial judge considered whether the evidence obtained from the search should be
excluded under s. 24(2) .  He stated that the onus lay with the Crown to
establish that admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.  He determined that the search was ""sufficiently
arbitrary"" and ""sufficiently contrary to the spirit of the words
given by Mr. Justice Dickson in the Southam case"" to
warrant exclusion of the evidence:

 

    Here,
the surveillance was set up because of information deemed to be reliable by
Constable Gutteridge, who remained in Chatham on another investigation.  The
basis for the surveillance was apparently relayed to Sgt. Briscoe who briefed
some officers but did not testify.  Constable L'Heureux, as I recall it, did
not have the nature of the briefing in his notes.  My recollection is that
Constable Birs did not know the amount of speed involved.  The chain of
information was rather nebulous.  The officers in their testimony were unsure
of themselves.  They were on surveillance and really, the officers who stopped
the accused carried out an administrative act.  The decision had been made
higher up apparently by Sgt. Briscoe who did not testify.  From the evidence I
have heard there was no reasonable cause for the search to be ordered based on
except [sic] the sighting of the accused's vehicle at the Carpenter
residence without knowing if the accused was in it.

 

    Clements
Dist. Ct. J. did not consider the past conduct or reputation of the accused as
a factor bearing on the reasonableness of the search under s. 8  or on the
effect of the exclusion of the evidence on the repute of the administration of
justice under s. 24(2) .

 

Ontario
Court of Appeal  ((1986), 30 C.C.C. (3d) 207)

 

    The
Ontario Court of Appeal (Martin, Goodman and Krever JJ.A.) unanimously allowed
the Crown's appeal and ordered a new trial.  Writing for the Court, Martin J.A.
first addressed the evidence required to justify a warrantless search for
controlled drugs under s. 37  of the Food and Drugs Act .  He
proceeded from the position that the reasonable belief required by s. 37 
imposes a standard of ""reasonable probability"" or ""probable
cause"" rather than ""proof beyond a reasonable doubt"" or ""prima facie
case"".  On his view of the facts Martin J.A. found that Constable Birs had
reasonable grounds to believe that the accused was in possession of a
prohibited drug.  At page 219 he reviewed the relevant evidence on this point:

 

The information supplied by the informer to Constable
Gutteridge was not a mere conclusory statement that the respondent was engaging
in criminal activity with respect to drugs.  Rather, the informer disclosed the
underlying circumstances of the expected drug transaction, including the
location where it was to take place.  The informer told Gutteridge that the
respondent was going to Carpenter's house to complete his part in the drug
transaction.  The police investigation confirmed that the respondent's car
arrived at Carpenter's house and that one of the occupants, at least, entered
the house.  Two men and two women came out of the house shortly thereafter, got
into the respondent's car and drove away.  Furthermore, the informer had proved
to be reliable, with respect to information that he had given the police on
previous occasions.

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

In
addition, Constable Birs was informed by Sergeant Briscoe that DeBot's Ford
Bronco was leaving Carpenter's residence and that it bore licence No. KP 7409.

 

    Citing
the decision of this Court in Eccles v. Bourque, [1975]
2 S.C.R. 739, Martin J.A. pointed out that the fact that the information
Constable Birs received was hearsay from another officer did not preclude it
from establishing probable cause.  Martin J.A. also ruled, at p. 220, that the
reputation of a person as a drug user and drug trafficker may be ""a
relevant factor constituting part of the total circumstances that induce a
reasonable belief that the suspect has upon his person a prohibited drug""
even although it would not by itself constitute reasonable grounds.  The policy
rule that excludes such evidence at trial has no application, he stated, in
determining probable grounds for an arrest or search.

 

    Martin
J.A. also held that even if Constable Birs did not, personally, have any
information establishing reasonable grounds for a search, he was entitled to
rely on the orders of a superior officer against a claim of arbitrariness as
long as the superior officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect
had a prohibited drug in his possession.  It would be unrealistic and
impractical, Martin J.A. stated, to require a police officer to obtain from his
or her superior all the information supporting the order to search a person
suspected of the commission of a crime especially where the suspect may be
fleeing from the scene.

 

    Martin
J.A. also decided that an automobile is a ""place"" within the meaning
of s. 37(1) (a) of the Food and Drugs Act  and
that the accused was ""found"" in the car within the meaning of s.
37(1) (b) even although he got out of the car as Constable Birs
approached him.  Quoting from the Court of Appeal's earlier decision in R. v. Rao (1984),
12 C.C.C. (3d) 97, at p. 125, (leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
refused [1984] 2 S.C.R. ix), Martin J.A. observed at p. 222 that ""a
warrantless search of vehicles, vessels or aircrafts [sic], which
may move quickly away, may be reasonable where there are reasonable grounds for
believing that such contains a narcotic"".

 

    Martin
J.A. also disagreed with the trial judge's conclusion that the search was not
incidental to a valid arrest because the search preceded the arrest and because
the officer stated, in effect, that he would not have arrested the accused had
the search not produced a prohibited drug.  Martin J.A. rejected the contention
that this was a finding of fact made by the trial judge.  In his view, what
constitutes a search incident to arrest is a question of law.  As long as the
officer has probable cause to arrest the suspect, the fact that he or she
postpones the decision until after the search is not fatal.  This is so because
the reasonable belief that the suspect has committed the offence of being in
possession of a prohibited drug may turn out to be erroneous.  Alternatively,
the officer may still have reasonable grounds for making the arrest but
conclude that there would be no chance of obtaining a conviction without the
evidence.  In these circumstances an arrest would be pointless.

 

    The
trial judge did not deal with the s. 10 (b)
argument because he acquitted the accused on the basis of s. 8 .  The Court of
Appeal held that the accused was ""detained"" by the police when the
car was stopped and ""when he was directed to face the wall and place his
hands on it and when he submitted to the search"".  He was informed of his
right to counsel upon arrest but the issue was whether he was entitled to
retain and instruct counsel prior to the search.  On this issue, Martin J.A.
adopted Morden J.A.'s ruling in R. v. Kelly (1985), 17 C.C.C.
(3d) 419, that a right to counsel ""without delay"" did not mean
""immediately"".  Morden J.A. pointed out as well that the relevant
interest protected by s. 10 (b) is ""that of not prejudicing one's legal position
by something said or done without, at least, the benefit of legal
advice"".  Martin J.A. concluded that the conduct of the on-the-spot search
did not prejudice the interest of the accused protected by s. 10 (b) of the Charter .  Not
only might it be dangerous to postpone searches until a suspect can consult
with counsel (as in cases where the suspect might be carrying a weapon) but
postponing a search for drugs until counsel arrives would require the suspect
to be kept in close custody and under close observation during the intervening period. 
Martin J.A. stated at p. 228:

 

    This
would be necessary to ensure that he or she did not dispose of any prohibited
drugs.  The adoption of such a course could not be of any benefit to the
respondent and might very well be more intrusive than an on-the-spot search of
the kind that occurred here.  This on-the-spot search, if it had failed to
disclose he was in possession of a drug, might have resulted in DeBot's
immediate release.

 

    Martin
J.A. also adopted the proposition of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v.
Guberman (1985), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 406, that a search by police for
physical evidence is distinguishable from circumstances in which an accused is
being asked to incriminate himself, either verbally or by providing a breath
sample, as occurred in R. v. Therens, [1985] 1 S.C.R.
613.  Martin J.A. quotes the following passage from R. v. Guberman with
approval at p. 229:

 

    The search of the accused was part of a continuing
investigation to find physical evidence.  There were no options open to the
accused upon which he might require the advice of counsel prior to the search. 
He was not being asked to provide evidence which might prove incriminating such
as a statement or a breath sample.  The immediate advice he required was with
respect to his entitlement to release and how to achieve it.

 

    In
these last respects the present case is very different from cases involving
breathalyzers, such as R. v. Therens . . . . In
breathalyzer cases an accused has an option as to whether or not he should blow
and is entitled to advice as to the grounds on which he might refuse and the
consequences of doing so . . . . The Charter  right to retain and instruct
counsel must be construed in a manner consistent with its purpose, to enable an
accused person to obtain advice as to his rights in the circumstances in which
he finds himself and assistance in exercising those rights.  This cannot
extend to matters such as a physical search for narcotics to which the accused
is obliged to submit and which no amount of advice or legal assistance would
deter.  [Emphasis added.]  

 

Martin
J.A. concluded, at p. 229, that s. 10 (b) of the Charter  does
not contemplate the exercise of the right to counsel ""prior to a lawful
and reasonable on-the-scene search incident to a lawful arrest.""

 

    In
light of his conclusions with respect to s. 8  and s. 10 (b),
Martin J.A. dealt with exclusion of the evidence under s. 24(2)  very briefly. 
He corrected the trial judge's placement of the onus and stated that the
""onus was on the person seeking to exclude the evidence to establish on a
balance of probability that its admission would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute"".  He then stated that if the accused's Charter  rights
were infringed in this case such infringement did not require the exclusion of
the evidence.

 

4.  Analysis

 

    In R. v.
Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, Lamer J. stated, at p. 278, that
a search will be reasonable ""if it is authorized by law, if the law itself
is reasonable and if the manner in which the search was carried out is
reasonable"".

 

    A
warrantless search for controlled drugs is expressly authorized by s. 37  of the Food and
Drugs Act .  The appellant does not challenge the statutory
standard of ""reasonable belief"" contained in that provision.  Rather,
he alleges that this standard was not met by the police in this case and that
the search is therefore unreasonable under s. 8 .  The respondent Crown did not
argue that s. 37 , either by necessary implication or through its operating
requirements, is irreconcilable with the s. 8  or s. 10 (b) rights
and is accordingly a limit on those rights which is ""prescribed by
law"" under s. 1 .  Therefore, this Court must proceed from the position
that s. 37  of the Food and Drugs Act  is compatible with
both ss. 8  and 10 (b) of the Charter .  The questions to
be addressed under s. 37  are whether the officer had a ""reasonable
belief"" that the appellant was in possession of a controlled drug and
whether the search was carried out in a reasonable manner.  In order to
facilitate discussion of the consequences of a s. 10 (b)
violation on the reasonableness of a search I propose to deal with the right to
counsel issue first.

 

The Right
to Counsel

 

    In R. v.
Therens, Le Dain J. provides a definition of
""detention"" for purposes of s. 10 (b) which
has been adopted by this Court.  At pages 641-42 of his judgment Le Dain J.
writes:

 

    In determining the meaning that should be given to
the word ""detention"" in s. 10  of the Charter  it is
necessary to consider the purpose of the section.  This is the approach to the
interpretation and application of the Charter  that
was affirmed by this court in Hunter v. Southam Inc. . . .

 

    The purpose of s. 10  of the Charter  is to
ensure that in certain situations a person is made aware of the right to
counsel and is permitted to retain and instruct counsel without delay.  The
situations specified by s. 10  -- arrest and detention -- are obviously not the
only ones in which a person may reasonably require the assistance of counsel,
but they are situations in which the restraint of liberty might otherwise
effectively prevent access to counsel or induce a person to assume that he or
she is unable to retain and instruct counsel.  In its use of the word
""detention"", s. 10  of the Charter  is
directed to a restraint of liberty other than arrest in which a person may
reasonably require the assistance of counsel but might be prevented or impeded
from retaining and instructing counsel without delay but for the constitutional
guarantee.

 

    In addition to the case of deprivation of liberty
by physical constraint, there is in my opinion a detention within s. 10  of the Charter  when a
police officer or other agent of the state assumes control over the movement of
a person by a demand or direction which may have significant legal consequence
and which prevents or impedes access to counsel.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    It
is clear from R. v. Therens, as well as from
subsequent decisions of this Court, that when police officers stop a car and
order one of the occupants to stand ""spread eagle"" against a wall,
that person is ""detained"" within the meaning of s. 10 :  R. v.
Simmons, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 495; R. v. Jacoy, [1988]
2 S.C.R. 548; R. v. Strachan, [1988] 2 S.C.R.
980.  In light of the fact that the arresting officers were instructed in
advance to stop and search the car and its occupants I would find that the
appellant was detained from the time he was approached by Constable Birs.

 

    In
earlier decisions of this Court in which s. 10 (b)
violations were found to have occurred the function that counsel could have
provided to the accused had he or she been informed of the right to counsel
without delay was discussed.  In R. v. Simmons and R. v.
Jacoy the accused were searched by customs officers without
being informed of their right to seek a second opinion on the reasonable cause
issue from a magistrate, justice of the peace, or senior customs officer.  It
is clear from the majority judgments of the Chief Justice in these cases,
however, that the ability of counsel to inform the accused of their options
under s. 144 of the Customs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-40, was only one factor leading to the conclusion that their right to counsel
had been violated.  In R. v. Simmons the Chief Justice
stated at pp. 530-31:

 

What is clear is that the appellant was unsure of the
officers' authority.  Although she complied with their demands throughout, at
one point during the search she asked whether it was really necessary for her
to comply.

 

    It
is clear from the foregoing that the right to counsel has an important impact
on the execution of the search.  Had the appellant been informed of her right
to counsel at the point she was detained, and she availed herself of that right,
the appellant would have had the benefit of legal advice.  Counsel could have
dispelled the appellant's uncertainty surrounding the search procedure by
explaining the content of ss. 143 and 144 and assuring the appellant of the
officers' right to insist she remove her clothing.  Counsel could also have
ensured that the statutory standard of reasonable cause to suppose had been
satisfied and assured the appellant that there were proper grounds to warrant a
search.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    The
Chief Justice in this passage from his reasons focusses on the inherent benefit
of knowing one's legal rights and obligations and the value of having counsel
available to dispel uncertainty and provide assurance to the suspect that the
officers do have the authority they are seeking to assert.  Counsel's role,
therefore, is not limited to advising a suspect of his or her options where
such options exist.  It is broader than that.

 

    A
good example of this broader perspective is found in R. v. Strachan where
police executed a validly issued search warrant on the accused's residence but
did not permit the accused to contact his counsel until after the search had
ended and the accused had been taken to the police station.  The majority of
the Court held that the accused's right to counsel had been violated as of the
time the police located the restricted weapons and unknown parties in the
accused's apartment.  While concurring in the ultimate disposition of the
appeal I was of the view that the s. 10 (b) violation
commenced from the moment the accused was arrested and prevented from calling
his lawyer.  The salient point, however, is that the Court did not view the
answer to the question whether counsel could have been instrumental in averting
the search as determinative of whether the right to counsel had been violated. 
Indeed, the Court unanimously held in R. v. Strachan that
the search warrant was validly issued and that the police were entitled to
search the apartment.  It found that the right to counsel had been violated
nonetheless.  It is accordingly, in my view, no answer to an alleged breach of
the s. 10 (b) right that counsel could not have prevented the search
in any event.

 

    In
sum, nothing in this Court's approach to s. 10 (b) lends
support to a definition of detention that is contingent on a hypothetical
assessment of the utility of counsel in precluding the discovery of real
evidence.  Any submission that the appellant did not ""reasonably require
the assistance of counsel"" (R. v. Therens) because counsel
could not have prevented the search in any event must therefore fail.

 

    Section
10 (b) also instructs the police to inform a detainee of his
or her rights to counsel ""without delay"".   As I have stated
elsewhere, the phrase ""without delay"" does not permit of internal
qualification:  R. v. Strachan; R. v.
Simmons; R. v. Jacoy.  As I pointed out
in R. v. Jacoy and R. v. Strachan, the phrase does
not mean ""at the earliest possible convenience"" or ""after police
`get matters under control'"", or even ""without reasonable
delay""; to which I add here that ""without delay"" likewise does
not mean ""after police have had a chance to search the suspect"".  In R. v.
Strachan, I suggested at p. 1013 that there may be
""situations in which the police for their own safety have to act in the
heat of the moment to subdue the suspect and may be excused for not pausing to
advise the suspect of his rights and permit him to exercise them ...."" 
See also R. v. Manninen, [1987] 1 S.C.R.
1233.  In my view, time spent in legitimate self-protection is not an example
of the ""delay"" which has to be justified within a s. 10 (b)
analysis.  The police are not deliberately forestalling advising a suspect of
his or her s. 10 (b) rights when they could be going ahead.  They are not
expected to go ahead with undue risk to their own lives or safety.  However,
there was no suggestion in the present case that the police did not inform the
appellant of his right to counsel upon detention because of an apprehension of
immediate danger.  The appellant was not violent or obstructive and the police
do not appear to have suspected him of possessing a weapon.

 

    The
Ontario Court of Appeal took the view that conducting a drug search prior to
advising a detainee of his right to counsel was analogous to conducting a
weapons search prior to advising a suspect of his right to counsel.  With
respect, I think the analogy is unsound.  In the latter case, the legitimate
motive of the police is safety and self-preservation.  In the former, the
police motivation for the delay is the concern to preserve incriminating
evidence which they fear the suspect will try to destroy or dispose of.  I see
no analogy between these two justifications for not advising a person of their
rights immediately upon detention.  The police are, of course, entitled to take
whatever steps they think are required to prevent the suspect from destroying
incriminating evidence but this does not include a violation of the suspect's Charter  rights.

 

    Martin
J.A. correctly observes that drugs are easily disposed of and, if the right to
counsel arises before a drug search, the police may have to keep suspects who
want to exercise their s. 10 (b) rights ""in
close custody and under close observation"" until counsel can be
contacted.  I agree that such procedures may cause great inconvenience to the
police and may in the end prove more intrusive to the suspect than the
""on-the-spot"" search.  Nevertheless, it is not for the police, or for
this Court, to waive the rights guaranteed to the appellant by s. 10 (b); only
he can make that choice.

 

    If
there are to be limits on the right to counsel other than the limit required
for the safety of the police, i.e., if there are to be qualifications put upon
the words ""without delay"" in s. 10 (b), then
it seems to me that they must be supported under s. 1  of the Charter .  The
respondent Crown, as already mentioned, did not submit that a limitation on the
right to counsel arises by necessary implication from the terms of s. 37  of the Food and
Drugs Act , or from its operating requirements:  R. v.
Therens (per Le Dain J.)  As a consequence it is neither possible
nor necessary for the Court to consider here whether an on-the-spot drug search
prior to advising a detainee of the right to counsel is a limit on s. 10 (b)
""prescribed by law"" which is reasonable and demonstrably justified
under s. 1 .  I find, therefore, that the appellant was detained and not
informed of his right to counsel without delay contrary to the express words of
s. 10 (b) of the Charter .

 

Unreasonable
Search

 

    As
noted earlier, the appellant does not challenge the constitutionality of s. 37 
of the Food and Drugs Act .  He alleges rather that the search was carried out in
an unreasonable manner because the police did not have ""a reasonable
belief"" that the appellant was in possession of a controlled drug when the
decision to search him was made.  The trial judge's assessment of the evidence
led him to conclude that reasonable grounds for the search did not exist. 
Martin J.A.'s assessment led the Court of Appeal to the opposite conclusion.

 

    The
question as to what standard of proof must be met in order to establish
reasonable grounds for a search may be disposed of quickly.  I agree with
Martin J.A. that the appropriate standard is one of ""reasonable
probability""  rather than ""proof beyond a reasonable doubt"" or
""prima facie case"".  The phrase ""reasonable belief""
also approximates the requisite standard.

 

    Another
preliminary issue raised on the facts before us is who exactly in the police
department (if anyone) actually had reasonable grounds for the search.  Martin
J.A. held that Constable Birs, the officer who actually performed the search,
had reasonable grounds based on the following three pieces of evidence:  (1)
Constable Gutteridge had relayed the informant's tip to Constable Birs; (2)
Constable Birs received a radio message from Sergeant Briscoe stating that the
appellant's car bearing licence No. KP 7409 was leaving the Carpenter
residence; and, (3) Constable Birs was aware of the appellant's reputation as a
drug user and trafficker.

 

    The
Court of Appeal further suggested, at p. 221, that Constable Birs could also
have relied on the order from his superior officer, Sergeant Briscoe, to stop
and search the appellant.  In my opinion, Constable Birs must rely on
Sergeant Briscoe's order.  Since the decision to stop and search the appellant
was made by Sergeant Briscoe and not by Constable Birs, it is immaterial, in my
view, what knowledge Constable Birs had when executing Sergeant Briscoe's
request.  Constable Birs was simply following orders; he had no decision to
make upon which to bring his own knowledge and belief to bear.  It would have
made no difference had he known nothing about the case and had merely been on
patrol in the area at the opportune time.

 

    The
police officer who must have reasonable and probable grounds for believing a
suspect is in possession of a controlled drug is the one who decides that the
suspect should be searched.  That officer may or may not perform the actual
search.  If another officer conducts the search, he or she is entitled to
assume that the officer who ordered the search had reasonable and probable
grounds for doing so.  Of course, this does not prove that reasonable grounds
actually existed.  It does make clear, however, that the pertinent question is
whether Sergeant Briscoe and not Constable Birs had reasonable and probable
grounds.  Regrettably and inexplicably, Sergeant Briscoe did not testify at the
appellant's trial.  The record only indicates what he was told by others who
did testify.  We are left in the unsatisfactory position of having to construct
the grounds on which Sergeant Briscoe made his decision from the testimony of
those who supplied him with the relevant information.

 

    It
appears that the only piece of evidence originating from Sergeant Briscoe
himself was the fact that the licence plate number of the Ford Bronco parked in
front of the Carpenter residence matched a vehicle registered in the
appellant's name.   The remainder of the evidence came from other officers.  
The informant's tip was conveyed to Sergeant Briscoe by Constable Gutteridge
and the activities in front of the Carpenter residence were transmitted on
police radio from Constable MacLaughlan to Constable Briscoe.  Given Sergeant
Briscoe's failure to testify, his direct knowledge of the appellant's
reputation cannot be presumed either.

 

    In Eccles v.
Bourke, a pre-Charter  case decided by
this Court, Dickson J. (as he then was) held that hearsay evidence communicated
by one officer to another may contribute to establishing probable cause.  The
principle was applied more recently by this Court in the Charter  case of R. v. Collins.  In
the present case, the tip from the confidential source was hearsay in Sergeant
Briscoe's hands.  While Sergeant Briscoe was entitled to assume the
authenticity of Gutteridge's report of his conversation with the informant, the
value of the evidence in establishing reasonable and probable grounds must also
take into account the credibility of the informant, whether or not Sergeant
Briscoe himself had any personal knowledge of the source.

 

    In
my view, there are at least three concerns to be addressed in weighing evidence
relied on by the police to justify a warrantless search.  First, was the
information predicting the commission of a criminal offence compelling? 
Second, where that information was based on a ""tip"" originating from
a source outside the police, was that source credible?  Finally, was the
information corroborated by police investigation prior to making the decision
to conduct the search?  I do not suggest that each of these factors forms a
separate test.  Rather, I concur with Martin J.A.'s view that the
""totality of the circumstances"" must meet the standard of
reasonableness.  Weaknesses in one area may, to some extent, be compensated by
strengths in the other two.

 

    With
respect to the first aspect, the following data was relied on by the police in
deciding to investigate the activities of the appellant:  (1) Constable
Gutteridge had received information predicting a drug transaction between
Carpenter, List and the appellant at the Carpenter residence on the evening of
February 26, 1985; (2) the informant claimed to have acquired this knowledge
directly from one of the actors; (3) the appellant had a prior conviction for a
drug offence, albeit a minor one; (4) the other two participants in the
transaction had convictions for narcotics related offences; (5) all three were
reputed to be drug users and traffickers.

 

    I
find that the information received by Constable Gutteridge was sufficiently
specific to warrant the attention of the police.  The informant identified the
participants and the courier, named the location of the transaction, and
specified the time of day when the event would take place.  He also gave the
basis for his assertions, namely a conversation with one of the participants. 
The information did not take the form of bald conclusory statements or
""mere rumour or gossip"" to use the words of Martin J.A. at p. 219.

 

    The
significance of the past record and reputation of the appellant, as well as the
background of the other participants, presents a more difficult problem.  It is
surely beyond question that reputation alone would never provide reasonable
grounds for a search.  The appellant, however, objects to any use of reputation
as a relevant factor.  He relies on the United States decision in Spinelli
v. United States, 393 U.S. 410 (1969), for the proposition that it
offends public policy to use reputation to give additional weight to
allegations that would otherwise be insufficient to establish reasonable
grounds for a search.

 

    I am
sensitive to the argument advanced by counsel for the appellant that the
reputation of a suspect should not be used to buttress an otherwise
insubstantial case for searching a suspect.  At the same time I find it
difficult to accept the proposition that the past activities of a suspect are
irrelevant.  Indeed, as Martin J.A. points out at pp. 220-21 of his judgment:

 

    Evidence
of bad character or prior criminal misconduct by an accused is excluded at his
or her trial on a criminal charge, not on the ground that the evidence has no
probative value, but on policy grounds, because the prejudicial effect of such
evidence outweighs its probative value.

 

    These
policy reasons are obviously not as cogent at the investigatory stage where the
liberty of the subject is not directly at stake.  Moreover, I think it is
somewhat artificial to assume that any one factor, be it reputation or
something else, is responsible for turning a previously
""insubstantial"" case into a sufficient one.  Having said that, I add
the following caveats to the use of reputation as germane to the issue of a
reasonable search.  First, the reputation of the suspect must be related to the
ostensible reasons for the search.  A background of driving offences, for
example, has little relevance to drug trafficking.  Second, if the reputation
of the suspect is based on hearsay rather than police familiarity with the
suspect, its veracity cannot be assumed.  In the present case, it appears that
the police relied on both direct experience and hearsay.  On the occasion
leading to the appellant's conviction for possession of marijuana Constable
Gutteridge executed a search warrant on the appellant's residence in which he
testified to having found ""marihuana .... traces of speed, scales, debt
list, smoking pipes, packaging material, baggies, that sort of thing"".  He
also testified to finding his name on the phone list of another person on whose
residence a search warrant was executed and drugs were found.  Constable
Gutteridge further claimed that he had received information from ""other confidential
sources"" to the effect that the appellant was a user and trafficker in
speed.  The record does not indicate anything about the reliability of the
sources who informed the police of the appellant's reputation; for that reason
I am inclined to give greater weight to Constable Gutteridge's first hand
observations.

 

    The
informant whose credibility is most critical, of course, is the one who
provided the details of the anticipated transaction.  At trial, Constable
Gutteridge testified that this source was not paid for his information and had
no outstanding charges or investigation pending against him.  The officer
stated that he had received information in the past from this source about the
activities of traffickers in general in Wallaceburg which the police had
corroborated through surveillance.  Information from this source had once led
to a search warrant's being executed on an apartment at which a quantity of
speed (less than anticipated) and marijuana were located along with scales and
debt lists.  Moreover, Constable Gutteridge testified that he had seen the informant
and Carpenter together on at least three or four occasions which lends some
support to the informant's claim that he received the information about the
anticipated transaction directly from Carpenter.  These pieces of evidence tend
to validate the decision to treat the informant as credible.  Different
considerations would, of course, apply in situations where the police rely on
an anonymous tip or on an untried informant.  In such circumstances the quality
of the information and corroborative evidence may have to be such as to
compensate for the inability to assess the credibility of the source.

 

    Turning
to the evidence yielded by police surveillance, it appears that the police were
able to confirm the arrival of the appellant's vehicle at the location of the
anticipated transaction (Carpenter's residence) in the evening as expected. 
Police also observed what they thought might be a drug transaction between a
man who had left the Carpenter residence and a woman in a bar.

 

    The
primary gap in the evidentiary foundation is the failure of the police to
actually spot the courier who was supposed to deliver the drugs.  The police
also failed to find Gerry List, the third participant in the alleged
transaction, although his vehicle was spotted in the Wallaceburg area (he
apparently resided in Chatham).  Another deficiency pointed out by counsel for
the appellant is the fact that the police did not identify the appellant
entering or leaving the Carpenter residence, although it was confirmed that the
Ford Bronco that arrived and departed from there belonged to him.

 

    With
respect to this last point, I have no hesitation in concluding that in the
circumstances of the case the police were entitled to infer that the appellant
was in his own vehicle when it was intercepted.  On the other hand, I think
little significance can be attached to the testimony of Constables Birs and
L'Heureux regarding a possible drug transaction at the bar.  Their observations
are highly speculative and of little probative value, especially since the
courier was not identified as one of the parties and the alleged transaction
was not part of the anticipated sequence of events.  Moreover, there was no
testimony confirming that they had conveyed their impressions to Sergeant
Briscoe so that it is impossible to know whether it was a factor in Sergeant
Briscoe's decision.

 

    The
failure of the police to spot the courier is the most serious deficiency in the
corroborative evidence of the police.  In my opinion, it should not be
necessary for the police to confirm each detail in an informant's tip so long
as the sequence of events actually observed conforms sufficiently to the
anticipated pattern to remove the possibility of innocent coincidence.  As I
noted earlier, however, the level of verification required may be higher where
the police rely on an informant whose credibility cannot be assessed or where
fewer details are provided and the risk of innocent coincidence is greater.  
Having regard to the quality of the information and the reliability of the
informant in this case, I am satisfied that the police surveillance yielded
sufficient corroborative evidence to warrant the belief that a drug transaction
had occurred.  Absent a consideration of the impact of the s. 10 (b)
violation on the reasonableness of the manner in which the search was
conducted, I would conclude that the police had reasonable and probable grounds
to search the appellant under the authority granted to them under s. 37  of the Food and
Drugs Act .

 

    Having
so concluded, it is unnecessary to decide whether the search could also be
justified as incidental to a valid arrest.

 

Interaction
of ss. 10 (b) and 8 

 

    I
have elsewhere expressed my doubts that a search conducted in the face of a Charter 
violation can be a reasonable search:  R. v. Simmons;  R. v.
Jacoy; R. v. Strachan.  I propose here
to comment further on what I referred to in R. v. Jacoy as the
""mutually reinforcing"" nature of the right to counsel and the right
to be secure against unreasonable search.

 

    I
start with the proposition that a monopoly on the use of certain types of power
is a sine qua non of a legitimate government and its agents.  With few
exceptions only the state can detain persons against their will, enter homes
without permission, forcibly subject someone to a search, and send people to
prison.  The intrusiveness and coercive nature of these procedures should not
be underestimated.  The legal rights guaranteed by the Charter  are
designed inter alia to circumscribe these coercive powers
of the state within the boundaries of justice and fairness to the individual. 
They are the most formidable defences the individual can marshall against
abuses of state power.  

 

    The
detained individual, however, cannot be assumed to be fully apprised of all his
or her Charter  rights at the critical moment.  Without that knowledge
a detainee may fail to exercise the rights he or she has or, by the same token,
attempt to resist in a mistaken belief that the police conduct is not lawful
when it is.  It should be apparent that the police are not the appropriate ones
to provide legal advice regarding the legitimacy of their own actions.  An
individual must rely on counsel to supply the vital information.  Indeed, it is
instructive to note that the only Charter  right the police
must inform a detained or arrested person of is the right to counsel.  Should
that right be exercised, it becomes the role of counsel to inform and advise
the client of his or her other legal rights and obligations in the
circumstances.  In this way, the right to counsel is for the suspect the key
which opens the door to all his or her other legal rights.  As I observed in R. v.
Jacoy, at p. 563, ""The right to counsel is surely the
main safeguard to the citizen that his or her other rights will be
respected.""

 

    In
the present case the substantive legal right we are concerned with is the right
to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.  In my view, the question
of whether a denial of the right to counsel renders a search unreasonable
depends on two factors:  (1) the source of authority for the search; and, (2)
the invasiveness of the search.

 

    In Hunter v.
Southam Inc., this Court first addressed the meaning of s. 8  of the Charter . 
Speaking for a unanimous Court, Dickson J. stated at p. 160 that the purpose of
s. 8  was to ""protect individuals from unjustified state intrusions upon
their privacy.""  To that end the ideal method of preventing unjustified
searches was held to be prior authorization in the form of a warrant issued by
a person capable of ""acting judicially"" who could assess the
competing interests of the state and the individual ""in a neutral and
impartial manner"".  Obviously, it is not always feasible to obtain a
search warrant before a search.  Thus, in certain limited situations the police
are permitted to conduct warrantless searches when they have satisfied
legislative and constitutional criteria.  The search for controlled drugs
pursuant to s. 37  of the Food and Drugs Act  is one such
example.

 

    One
cannot ignore, however, the risks inherent in authorizing the police to balance
their own interests against those of the individual when deciding whether to
conduct a search.  The right to counsel is obviously more critical in cases
where the decision by the police to search has not been subject to scrutiny by
an independent party.  In such cases the risk that the privacy interest of the
individual will not be accorded its full weight is greater.  Consequently, the
failure to advise an individual of his or her right to counsel detracts more
from the reasonableness of a warrantless search than from a search subject to
prior authorization.

 

    The
second factor I have identified as relevant is the invasiveness of the search. 
Any involuntary search undertaken by the state is necessarily coercive. 
Searches vary, however, in the extent to which they invade the privacy of the
individual.  To take an obvious example, a body cavity search is clearly more
invasive than a search of one's automobile.   The more invasive the search, the
greater the assault on one's dignity.  To the extent that counsel can provide
reassurance and advice to a person who may be subjected to a highly invasive
procedure and perhaps even prevent an unjustified search, his or her presence
can mitigate the impact of the intrusion on the individual's physical and
psychological integrity.

 

    The
appellant in the present case was subjected to a warrantless ""frisk""
search.  The fact that the appellant was denied his s. 10 (b) right
to counsel prior to a warrantless search militates, in my view, against the
reasonableness of the search.  On the other hand, a ""frisk"" search is
probably the least intrusive means of searching someone's physical person. 
There is no suggestion that the search in this case was accompanied by
mistreatment or undue force by the police.

 

    In
my opinion, the considerations I have mentioned are very relevant in assessing
the reasonableness of a search conducted under s. 8  of the Charter 
especially in light of the fact that they arise from another independent Charter  right,
the right to counsel.  In a case such as the present the interaction of the two
sections must be considered.  As I indicated earlier, the two are
""mutually reinforcing"".  Nevertheless, the two factors I have
identified as relevant in determining whether a denial of the right to counsel
renders a search unreasonable point in opposite directions in this case.  While
the failure to accord the appellant his s. 10 (b) rights
militates against the reasonableness of the warrantless search, the minimal
nature of the invasion of his privacy from the ""frisk"" type search
militates in favour of its reasonableness.  On balance, I find that a weighing
of these factors tends to confirm my preliminary view that the search of the
appellant in this case did not constitute a violation of s. 8  of the Charter .

 

Section
24(2) of the Charter

 

    Having
found that the respondent's s. 10 (b) right to counsel
was violated, I turn to the remaining question in this appeal, namely whether
the  appellant can discharge his onus of proving that the evidence should have
been excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .

 

    In R. v.
Collins, Lamer J. identified the factors to be considered in
deciding whether the admission of evidence would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.  These factors have been applied by the Court in
several cases:  R. v. Simmons; R. v.
Jacoy; R. v. Strachan.  In R. v.
Jacoy the Chief Justice summarized them briefly at pp.
558-59:

 

    To reiterate briefly the criteria set out in Collins, Lamer
J. speaking for the majority grouped the factors relevant to the determination
into three groups.  First, the court must consider whether the admission of
evidence will affect the fairness of the trial.  If this inquiry is answered
affirmatively, ""the admission of evidence would tend to bring the
administration of justice into disrepute and, subject to a consideration of other
factors, the evidence generally should be excluded"" (p. 284).  One of the
factors relevant to this determination is the nature of the evidence; if the
evidence is real evidence that existed irrespective of the Charter 
violation, its admission will rarely render the trial unfair.

 

    The second set of factors concerns the seriousness
of the violation.  Relevant to this group is whether the violation was
committed in good faith, whether it was inadvertent or of a merely technical
nature, whether it was motivated by urgency or to prevent the loss of evidence,
and whether the evidence could have been obtained without a Charter 
violation.

 

    Finally,
the court must look at factors relating to the effect of excluding the
evidence.  The administration of justice may be brought into disrepute by
excluding evidence essential to substantiate the charge where the breach of the Charter  was
trivial.  While this consideration is particularly important where the offence
is serious, if the admission of the evidence would result in an unfair trial,
the seriousness of the offence would not render the evidence admissible.

 

    The
evidence produced by the search conducted following the denial of the
appellant's s. 10 (b) rights was approximately one ounce of speed.  It was
real evidence the existence of which was totally unrelated to the Charter 
violation.  Unlike an incriminating statement it was not engendered by
conscripting the appellant against himself.  Its admission would not render the
trial unfair.

 

    With
respect to the second set of considerations, there is no evidence to suggest
that the police acted in bad faith in thinking that it did not have to read the
respondent his s. 10 (b) rights before searching him.  Constable Birs advised
the appellant of his right to counsel immediately upon arrest and advised him
of it again when they reached the police station.  I accept the submission of
the Crown that the on-the-spot search of the appellant was motivated by the fact
that drugs are readily disposed of and that the evidence might be lost if the
appellant was not searched right away.  Whether the police were right or wrong
in concluding that this was a valid reason for not reading the appellant his
rights ""without delay"" does not affect the issue of their bona fides.

 

    I
also conclude that the admission of the evidence in this case would not bring
the administration of justice into disrepute.  While the denial of the
appellant's right to counsel was certainly not trivial, it seems to me that the
""interests of truth"" and the ""integrity of the judicial
system"" referred to by the Chief Justice in R. v. Simmons, at p.
534, would be better served by the admission of the evidence than by its
exclusion. 

 

    For
all the foregoing reasons I would dismiss the appeal.

 

//Sopinka J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    SOPINKA J. -- I
have read the reasons of my colleagues Justice Lamer and Justice Wilson.  I
agree with their disposition of the appeal.  Subject to the qualification
expressed in the reasons of Lamer J., I agree with the conclusion of
Wilson J. that no violation of s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  occurred in this case.

 

    With
respect to the alleged violation of s. 10 (b),
Wilson J. has concluded that there has been a violation, and s. 1 
cannot be considered because the Crown did not seek to invoke this provision. 
Lamer J. is of the view that while the appellant had the right to be
informed of the right to retain and instruct counsel, the police were not
obliged to suspend the search until an opportunity to retain counsel was
afforded to the appellant.  In my opinion, there was in this case no obligation
to advise the appellant of his right to counsel before completing the
""frisk"" search.  While in a practical sense, my position and that of
Lamer J. both result in the search proceeding immediately, there is this
significant difference.  In my view, there is no Charter 
violation while in his there is.  If a breach of s. 10 (b) has
occurred, it is necessary to consider the remedy for the breach under
s. 24(2) .

 

    This
difference is sufficiently important for me to explain briefly the basis for my
opinion.  I have difficulty in appreciating what purpose is served in advising
a detainee of a right which is then immediately suspended while the police
conduct a search.  The considerations which justify a postponement of the
obligation to afford the detainee a reasonable opportunity to consult counsel
apply equally to the obligation to tell him or her of the right.  I agree with
the statement by Martin J.A. in the Court of Appeal ((1986), 30 C.C.C.
(3d) 207, at p. 227) that:

 

    It
necessarily follows that where the obligation to inform a person of his or her
right to counsel arises, there is an obligation to afford that person a
reasonable opportunity to consult counsel if he or she wishes to do so.

 

    If
the circumstances surrounding a search incidental to an arrest do not lend
themselves to the delay inherent in making counsel available, they are equally
not conducive to the reading of rights from cue cards and the discussion which
almost inevitably follows.

 

    This
Court has recognized that s. 10 (b) rights
must be set aside in the interests of the protection of police officers where
there is a possible presence of weapons.  See R. v. Strachan, [1988]
2 S.C.R. 980.  The withholding of s. 10 (b) rights
while co-ordination tests are administered to a motorist has been justified in
order to enable reasonable grounds of impairment to be obtained to warrant a
demand for a breathalyzer test.  See R. v. Saunders (1988),
41 C.C.C. (3d) 532, and R. v. Bonin (1989), 47 C.C.C.
(3d) 230.  In the latter case, this Court refused leave to appeal (October 19,
1989, Bulletin of Proceedings, p. 2435).  It has been recognized,
therefore, that the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay is not
absolute.  I see no reason why the right to be informed of the right should be
accorded different treatment.

 

    Furthermore,
if the right to be informed can be breached where the right to retain and
instruct counsel is suspended, what possible remedy can be applied?  What are
the consequences for the administration of justice from a failure to be told of
a right that cannot be exercised?  In the absence of any discernible purpose in
advising the appellant of a right which he cannot enjoy, the application of
s. 10 (b) suggested by Lamer J. does not seem to accord
with the purposive approach to the interpretation of the Constitution which we
have adopted.

 

    I
therefore agree with Martin J.A. that there has been no breach of
s. 10 (b) and would dismiss the appeal.

    Criminal
law -- Arson and other fires -- Elements of offence ‑‑ Accused
convicted of wilfully setting fire to material which was likely to cause a
building to catch fire -- Recklessness on the part of the accused ‑‑ Whether
s. 434(a) of the Criminal Code requires knowledge by the accused that the
building was likely to catch fire.

 

    The
accused was charged under s. 433  of the Criminal Code  with
wilfully setting fire to his house and, under s. 434 (a), of
wilfully setting fire to material which was likely to cause the house to catch
fire.  The evidence indicated that the accused started a fire in the fireplace.
As was his practice, he used gasoline to light the fire. Some clothing lying
near the hearth caught fire some time later, so he pushed it into the
fireplace. To reduce the smoke, he poured gasoline on the clothing. At the
time, the accused had consumed a considerable amount of alcohol. He then left
the house leaving the fire unattended. The accused testified that he had no
intention to burn his house but admitted that he might have spilled some
gasoline on the carpet and left the screen of the fireplace open. He was
acquitted on the first count but convicted on the second. The trial judge found
that the accused was reckless when he burned such a large package of clothing
in a relatively small fireplace, and concluded that the act of setting fire to
the clothing in those circumstances was objectively likely to cause the
building to catch fire. The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the
conviction. The court held that, under s. 434(a) of the Code, the
essential element of a guilty mind is satisfied by proof that the accused
wilfully set fire to the thing, here the clothing or other material, which was
likely to cause the building to catch fire.  There was no argument at trial or
in the Court of Appeal predicated on s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms .

 

    Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

    Per Lamer,
Wilson, La Forest, Gonthier and Cory JJ.: On the facts of this case, the
accused stands convicted on either test, objective, subjective, or a combination
of both.

Court of Appeal, the appeal should be dismissed.

    CORY J. --
This appeal comes to the Court as of right.

 

    On
the facts of this case, I am of the view that the accused stands convicted on
either test, objective, subjective, or a combination of both.  This can be seen
from the findings of fact made by the trial judge.

 

    With
regard to the state of mind and the awareness of the consequences of the
appellant, the trial judge found:

 

(1) Intoxication

 

On the evidence I am of the view:

 

(1)That the accused due to his admitted daily
consumption of alcohol had a great tolerance to alcohol.

 

(2)That he had consumed a considerable amount on the
date in question as is reflected by the breathalyzer tests.

 

(3)His
mind and actions were to an extent clouded by alcohol, but by his own evidence
he recollects the events with some detail and I can only conclude that he had
an operating mind on the date in question.  In other words, he was not so
intoxicated that he did not know what he was doing.  He had sufficient ability
to perceive what he was doing and the consequences which might follow.

 

The
trial judge stated:

 

... I find that Mr. Buttar was reckless in that he
burned such a large package of clothing in a relatively small fireplace.  When
one looks at the photographs this is clearly observable in photograph ten.  In
any normal sense a package of clothing of that size, if not placed securely in
the fireplace, would fall out.

 

    There is also evidence that Mr. Buttar admitted that
he probably did not close the screen.  He left the fire unattended.  He poured
gasoline on the clothing.  And, he also spilled gasoline on the carpet.

 

    If
these acts are taken together I'm satisfied they fit within the definition of
wilfulness.  That is, there was such reckless acts done even though there might
not have been a bad motive.

 

    As
there has been no constitutional challenge to s. 429  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , and as there was no argument
below predicated on s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , but
only Lambert J.A.'s reference to that section, I am of the view this is not the
proper case to articulate principles of law and, accordingly, I would dismiss
the appeal without further reasons.

Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , ss. 7 , 15 .

 

                   Appellant
was charged with failing or refusing to comply, without lawful excuse, with a
police officer's demand for a roadside breath sample made pursuant to s.
234.1(1)  of the Criminal Code . This section, while in force in the
province where the offence had occurred, had not been proclaimed in all
provinces. Before entering a plea of not guilty, appellant made a preliminary
objection as to the constitutionality of s. 234.1 . The judge ordered a stay of
proceedings on the ground that s. 234.1  infringed both the Canadian Bill of
Rights and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and hence was
inoperative. The Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from this judgment,
vacated the stay of proceedings and ordered a new trial. The issue here is
whether the non‑universal proclamation and application of the former s.
234.1  of the Criminal Code  infringed the right to equality before the law
recognized by s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights or the right
not to be deprived of life, liberty and security of the person except in
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice guaranteed by s. 7  of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

                   Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   The
fact that s. 234.1  of the Criminal Code  was in force in Ontario but not
in force in British Columbia and Quebec when the appellant was charged did not
infringe the right to equality before the law recognized by s. 1(b) of
the Canadian Bill of Rights. The inequality created by the non‑universal
proclamation and application of s. 234.1 of the Code was justified by a
valid federal objective.

 

                   ""Equality
before the law"" does not require that impugned legislation be reviewed
according to an exacting standard which would demand of Parliament the most
carefully tailored, finely crafted legislation. Rather, the legislation should
be examined in a general way to determine whether it is in pursuit of a valid
federal legislative objective.

 

                   The
concept of a valid federal objective clearly goes beyond legislative validity
under the division of powers. There must be a federal objective that provides a
reasonable justification for the particular inequality in the sense that the
inequality is not clearly arbitrary or capricious but finds some legitimate
basis in the particular legislative policy.

 

                   Parliament
has unquestioned legislative authority under the division of powers to limit
the territorial application of the criminal law. The general rule in s. 7  of
the Criminal Code  that its provisions apply throughout Canada does not
preclude, as a matter of construction, an intention on the part of Parliament
to authorize the proclamation of a particular provision of the criminal law in
force in some provinces but not in others.

 

                   The
burden is on the person invoking s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights to show that an inequality created by federal legislation is not
justified by a valid federal objective. Because of the impact that s. 234.1 
would have on provincial law enforcement priorities, efficacy and allocation of
resources in the operationally concurrent field of highway traffic control, it
is reasonable to ascribe to Parliament, in enacting s. 102(3) of the Criminal
Law Amendment Act, 1975, an intention that the Governor in Council should
have authority to make the proclamation of s. 234.1  in a particular province
dependent on the agreement of that province. This was, for the purposes of s.
1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, a valid federal objective
justifying the non‑universal application of s. 234.1  of the Criminal
Code . The non‑universal application of s. 234.1  accordingly did not
infringe the right to equality before the law recognized by s. 1(b) of
the Canadian Bill of Rights.

 

                   To
find constitutional protection for the right to equality before the law under
s. 7  of the Charter  in the present case would be contrary to the clear
expression of legislative intention resulting from ss. 15  and 32(2)  of the Charter 
that the constitutional protection of this right was not to take effect until
April 17, 1985.

judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

1.                       Le Dain J.‑‑The
question raised by this appeal is whether the non‑universal proclamation
and application of the former s. 234.1 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C‑34, as amended, respecting mandatory roadside breath testing,
as a result of which s. 234.1 was not in force in the provinces of British
Columbia and Quebec, infringed the right to equality before the law recognized
by s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, R.S.C. 1970, App. III,
or the right not to be deprived of life, liberty and security of the person
except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice guaranteed by
s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

2.                       The
appeal is from the judgment on January 21, 1985 of the Ontario Court of Appeal
(1985), 14 O.A.C. 2, allowing the Crown's appeal from the judgment on April 9,
1984 of Walneck Prov. Ct. J., who, on a charge that the appellant had failed or
refused without reasonable excuse to comply with the demand of a police officer
to provide forthwith a sample of breath into a roadside screening device,
contrary to s. 234.1(2)  of the Criminal Code , ordered a stay of
proceedings on the ground that s. 234.1  was inoperative because, not having
been proclaimed in force in British Columbia and Quebec, it infringed s. 1(b)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights and ss. 7  and 11 (g) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms . The Court of Appeal vacated the stay of
proceedings and ordered a new trial of the appellant.

 

                                                                     I

 

3.                       The
appellant was charged in an information that he ""on or about the 18th day
of December 1983 at the City of Thunder Bay in the said District of Thunder
Bay, without reasonable excuse failed or refused to comply with a demand made
to him by a peace officer under subsection (1)  of Section 234.1  of the Criminal
Code , in the circumstances therein mentioned to provide forthwith such sample
of his breath as in the opinion of the peace officer is necessary to enable a
proper analysis of his breath to be made by means of an approved road‑side
screening device and, where necessary to accompany the peace officer for the
purpose of enabling such a sample of his breath to be taken, contrary to
Section 234.1(2)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada."" On April 9, 1984, the
Crown having elected to proceed by indictment, the appellant was arraigned
before Walneck Prov. Ct. J. The appellant elected to be tried by the provincial
court judge but before pleading not guilty he made a preliminary objection. He
invoked the judgment of Walneck Prov. Ct. J. in the earlier case of R. v.
Rossignol (February 17, 1984, unreported) which had ordered a stay of
proceedings on the ground that s. 234.1  was inoperative because its non‑universal
proclamation and application infringed s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill
of Rights and ss. 7  and 11 (g) of the Charter . In ordering a
stay of proceedings on the charge against the appellant Walneck Prov. Ct. J.
applied his decision in Rossignol, in which he had expressed the view
that a law which made certain conduct a criminal offence in some provinces but
not in others offended the principle of equality before the law.

 

4.                       The
Ontario Court of Appeal (Martin, Lacourcière and Finlayson JJ.A.) allowed the
appeal from this judgment for the following reasons in the endorsement of
Martin J.A.:

 

                   We agree with the Crown's submission
that R. v. Hufsky, decided by this Court on September 18, 1984, is
conclusive that s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights does not render
s. 234.1  inoperative because it has not been proclaimed in force in the
Provinces of British Columbia and Quebec.

 

                   We are also of the view that s. 11 (g)
of the Charter  has no application.

 

                   With respect to s. 7  of the Charter ,
without attempting to define the ambit of the right protected by that section,
we are all of the opinion that the failure to proclaim s. 234.1  in force in all
the provinces of Canada at the same time did not contravene the respondent's
right not to be deprived of ""life, liberty and security of the
person"" except in accordance with the ""principles of fundamental
justice"".

 

                   We express no opinion with respect to
the effect of s. 15  of the Charter , when it comes into force, on the
failure of the Executive to proclaim s. 234.1  to be in force in the provinces
of British Columbia and Quebec.

 

                   Accordingly, the appeal is allowed,
the stay is vacated and a new trial is ordered on the information.

 

5.                       In
R. v. Hufsky (1984), 14 O.A.C. 1, which was also appealed to this Court and
argued at the same time as this appeal, the contention that the non‑universal
proclamation and application of s. 234.1  of the Criminal Code  infringed
s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights was rejected by the Ontario
Court of Appeal (Howland C.J.O., Martin and Blair JJ.A.) for the following
reasons in the endorsement of Howland C.J.O.:

 

Counsel for the appellant raised three grounds of
appeal:‑‑

 

                   1. His first contention was that
s. 234.1  of the Criminal Code  ... was inoperative because it had not
been proclaimed in British Columbia or Quebec and so infringed the right of the
appellant to equality before the law in s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill
of Rights.

 

                   We are unable to accept this
submission. We consider that the reasoning of this Court in R. v. Negridge
(1980), 6 M.V.R. 255, 17 C.R. (3d) 14, 54 C.C.C. (2d) 304 (Ont. C.A.), is
conclusive on this point.

 

6.                       In
R. v. Negridge (1980), 54 C.C.C. (2d) 304, the relevant issue was whether
s. 234(1)  of the Criminal Code , respecting the offence of impaired
driving, was inoperative as infringing s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill
of Rights because s. 234(2) , providing for discharge on condition of
submission to curative treatment, had not been proclaimed in force in Ontario.
The Ontario Court of Appeal (Martin, Houlden and Morden JJ.A.) answered this
question in the negative. Martin J.A., delivering the judgment of the Court,
said at pp. 307‑8:

 

                   Manifestly, the purpose of s. 234(2)
is to enable the Court, in appropriate cases, to choose a disposition the aim
of which is curative rather than punitive. It is equally evident that
Parliament contemplated that the necessary treatment facilities and staff would
be provided by the Provinces. It is, therefore, entirely reasonable for
Parliament to postpone the coming into force of s. 234(2) in a Province until
that Province has made the necessary arrangements to provide appropriate
facilities and staff for the treatment envisaged by its provisions.

 

                   Legislation enacted by the Parliament
of Canada does not infringe s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights
by reason of the fact that it does not apply to all areas of Canada, where
Parliament in enacting the legislation was seeking to achieve a valid federal
objective: see R. v. Burnshine (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 505 at pp. 510 and
513, 44 D.L.R. (3d) 584, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 693 at pp. 701 and 705.

 

                   The onus is upon the appellant to
show that in providing that the provisions of s. 234(2) shall come into force
in a Province only where it is proclaimed in force in that Province, Parliament
was not seeking to achieve a valid federal objective: see R. v. Burnshine,
supra, at p. 515 C.C.C., pp. 707‑8 S.C.R. The appellant has failed
to discharge that onus. I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal
against conviction.

 

7.                       The
issues with respect to s. 7  of the Charter  are the subject of the first
and second constitutional questions stated by the Chief Justice in his order of
November 20, 1986, as follows:

 

1.                Does the non‑universal
proclamation and application of s. 234.1  of the Criminal Code  of Canada
infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 7  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.                If the non‑universal
proclamation and application of s. 234.1  infringes or denies the rights and
freedoms guaranteed by s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ,
is s. 234.1  justified by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

Before
the hearing of the appeal the appellant abandoned the issues based on s. 15  of
the Charter  for which the third, fourth and fifth constitutional
questions had been stated by the Chief Justice. Nor was s. 11 (g) of the Charter 
relied on in this Court.

 

                                                                    II

 

8.                       The
former s. 234.1  of the Criminal Code  provided for mandatory roadside
breath testing as follows:

 

                   234.1 (1) Where
a peace officer reasonably suspects that a person who is driving a motor
vehicle or who has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in
motion or not, has alcohol in his body, he may, by demand made to that person,
require him to provide forthwith such a sample of his breath as in the opinion
of the peace officer is necessary to enable a proper analysis of his breath to
be made by means of an approved road‑side screening device and, where
necessary, to accompany the peace officer for the purpose of enabling such a
sample of his breath to be taken.

 

                   (2) Every one who, without
reasonable excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a demand made to him by a
peace officer under subsection (1) is guilty of an indictable offence or an
offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable

 

(a) for a first offence, to a fine of not
more than two thousand dollars and not less than fifty dollars or to
imprisonment for six months or to both;

 

(b) for a second offence, to imprisonment
for not more than one year and not less than fourteen days; and

 

(c) for each subsequent offence, to
imprisonment for not more than two years and not less than three months.

 

                   (3) In proceedings under this
section, where it is proved that the accused occupied the seat ordinarily
occupied by the driver of a motor vehicle, he shall be deemed to have had the
care or control of the vehicle unless he establishes that he did not enter or
mount the vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion.

 

                   (4) In this section,
""approved road‑side screening device"" means a device of a kind that
is designed to ascertain the presence of alcohol in the blood of a person and
that is approved for the purpose of this section by order of the Attorney
General of Canada.

 

9.                       Section
234.1  was enacted by s. 15 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1975, S.C.
1974‑75‑76, c. 93, which was assented to on March 30, 1976. Section
102(3) of that Act provided that s. 15  thereof should come into force by
proclamation as follows:

 

                   (3) The provisions of this Act
set out in any following paragraph of this subsection, namely,

 

(a) section 15 ,

 

(b) subsection 14(2) and 17(2), or

 

(c) sections 89 to 94,

 

shall come into force in any province only upon a day
fixed in a proclamation declaring the provisions of this Act set out in that
paragraph to be in force in that province.

 

10.                     Section
234.1  was proclaimed in force in Ontario and Alberta on September 15, 1976, in
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, the Northwest Territories and the
Yukon Territory on November 1, 1976, in Manitoba on December 8, 1976, in
Saskatchewan on January 1, 1977 and in Prince Edward Island on March 1, 1978.
(SI/76‑110, Canada Gazette, 13 October, 1976, pp. 2778‑79;
SI/76‑148, Canada Gazette, 8 December, 1976, pp. 3268‑69;
SI/76‑174, Canada Gazette, 22 December, 1976, pp. 3424‑25;
SI/77‑7, Canada Gazette, 12 January, 1977, pp. 161‑62; and
SI/78‑34, Canada Gazette, 22 March, 1978, pp. 1061‑62.)
Section 234.1  had not been proclaimed in force in the provinces of British
Columbia and Quebec when it was repealed by s. 36 of the Criminal Law
Amendment Act, 1985, S.C. 1985, c. 19, which was assented to on June 20,
1985, and replaced by a new s. 238 of the Code, s. 238(2) of which
corresponds to the former s. 234.1(1) . Pursuant to s. 212(2) of the amending
Act of 1985, which provides that s. 238(2) of the Code ""shall come
into force in any province on a day or days to be fixed by proclamation with
respect to that province"", s. 238(2) was proclaimed in force in each of
the provinces on December 4, 1985 (SI/85‑211, Canada Gazette, 11
December, 1985, pp. 4873‑75).

 

                                                                   III

 

11.                     The
first issue in the appeal is whether the fact that s. 234.1  of the Criminal
Code  was in force in Ontario but not in force in British Columbia and
Quebec more than seven years after its enactment, when the appellant was
charged in December 1983, infringed the right to equality before the law
recognized by s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, which
provides:

 

                   1. It is hereby
recognized and declared that in Canada there have existed and shall continue to
exist without discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour,
religion or sex, the following human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely,

 

                                                                    ...

 

(b) the right of the individual to equality
before the law and the protection of the law;

 

12.                     In
this appeal and in the Hufsky appeal, which was argued at the same time,
the appellants contended that the inequality created by the non‑universal
proclamation and application of s. 234.1 of the Code was not justified
by a valid federal objective, as that concept appears to have been applied by a
majority in this Court in The Queen v. Burnshine, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 693,
and subsequent decisions, but they also placed particular reliance on the
meaning that was given to that concept by McIntyre J. in MacKay v. The Queen,
[1980] 2 S.C.R. 370. In that case, after expressing the view that a valid
federal objective must be one that not only falls within federal legislative
competence under the division of powers but is also valid in the sense that it
does not infringe the Canadian Bill of Rights, McIntyre J. said, at p.
406, that the test for determining whether there has been such an infringement
is whether the inequality created by the challenged legislation is
""arbitrary, capricious or unnecessary, or whether it is rationally based
and acceptable as a necessary variation from the general principle of universal
application of law to meet special conditions and to attain a necessary and
desirable objective."" To essentially the same effect he expressed the test
at p. 407 as being ""whether any inequality has been created for a valid
federal constitutional objective, whether it has been created rationally in the
sense that it is not arbitrary or capricious and not based upon any ulterior
motive or motives offensive to the provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights,
and whether it is a necessary departure from the general principle of universal
application of the law for the attainment of some necessary and desirable
social objective."" McIntyre J. further emphasized the requirement that a
departure from the principle of equality must be necessary for the
realization of the legislative objective as follows, at p. 408: ""It must
not however be forgotten that, since the principle of equality before the law
is to be maintained, departures should be countenanced only where necessary for
the attainment of desirable social objectives, and then only to the extent
necessary in the circumstances to make possible the attainment of such
objectives.""

 

13.                     On
the other hand, the respondent in this appeal and in the Hufsky appeal,
as well as the supporting interveners, relied on what was said concerning the
valid federal objective test by Dickson C.J., speaking for the majority, in
Beauregard v. Canada, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 56, where, after reviewing the
jurisprudence of the Court with respect to s. 1(b) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights, the Chief Justice, with whom Estey and Lamer JJ. concurred,
said at p. 90:

 

                   This short history of ""equality
before the law"" under s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights
demonstrates that a majority of the Court was never prepared to review impugned
legislation according to an exacting standard which would demand of Parliament
the most carefully tailored, finely crafted legislation. On the contrary, a
majority of the Court was consistently prepared to look in a general way to
whether the legislation was in pursuit of a valid federal legislative
objective. This approach was followed in cases involving legislative
distinctions on the basis of race, sex and age, and in cases involving
profoundly important interests of the person asserting the equality right. The
passages which I have quoted from these cases indicate that the Court was
concerned with the merely statutory status of the Canadian Bill of Rights
and the declaratory nature of the rights it conferred. I believe the day has
passed when it might have been appropriate to re‑evaluate those concerns
and to reassess the direction this Court has taken in interpreting that
document.

 

14.                     The
Chief Justice did not refer to the test formulated by McIntyre J. in MacKay,
which was the one applied by the minority in Beauregard. Beetz J.,
dissenting, with whom McIntyre J. concurred, after quoting at length from the
reasons of McIntyre J. in MacKay and stating that he adopted them,
summed up the test in terms which emphasized the requirement of necessity, as
indicated in the following passages from his reasons for judgment, at pp. 116
and 117:

 

                   The test which is emphasized
throughout those reasons is that of the necessity of a specific discrimination
with respect to the attainment of a desirable social
objective . . . .

 

                   Furthermore, the test is all the more
exacting in that it includes an essential element of proportionality; even
where variation from the principle of universal application of the law is
justified, the principle cannot be tampered with to a degree or to an extent
which goes beyond what is necessary to reach a desirable social
objective . . . .

 

15.                     The
conclusion that must be drawn from Beauregard, with great respect, is
that the test formulated by McIntyre J. in MacKay‑‑at least
that part of it which requires that the departure from the principle of
equality be necessary to the attainment of the legislative purpose‑‑has
not been adopted by a majority in this Court as the test for the application of
s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, and that, as held by the
majority in Beauregard, it is too late to do so now.

 

16.                     The
concept of a valid federal objective, as applied by the majority in this Court,
clearly goes beyond legislative validity under the division of powers, but it
has not been given more definition in the cases than that which is reflected in
the passage quoted above from the judgment of the Chief Justice in Beauregard.
I think the most that is implicit in the cases is that there must be a federal
objective that provides a reasonable justification for the particular
inequality in the sense that the inequality is not clearly arbitrary or
capricious but finds some legitimate basis in the particular legislative
policy. To that extent there may be some common ground between the majority
approach to the valid federal objective test and that of McIntyre J. in MacKay.

 

17.                     The
valid federal objective justifying a territorial limitation of the application
of the criminal law that is implicit in Burnshine and Negridge is
a criminal law purpose requiring special facilities for its implementation.
Thus in Burnshine, which involved the validity or operative effect of a
provision of the Prisons and Reformatories Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. P‑21,
empowering the courts in British Columbia to sentence a person apparently under
the age of twenty‑two years to a combination of determinate and
indeterminate terms of imprisonment in particular penal institutions that could
exceed the maximum term of imprisonment fixed by the Criminal Code  for
the offence of which the person was convicted, Martland J., delivering the
judgment of the majority, said of the legislative purpose in that case, at p.
707: ""It was made applicable in British Columbia because that Province was
equipped with the necessary institutions and staff for that purpose.""
Similarly, in Negridge, in the passage I have quoted above, Martin J.A.
said: ""It is, therefore, entirely reasonable for Parliament to postpone
the coming into force of s. 234(2)  in a Province until that Province has made
the necessary arrangements to provide appropriate facilities and staff for the
treatment envisaged by its provisions."" The provision for selective
proclamation of s. 234.1 of the Code on a province by province basis
might originally have been justified on a similar basis, as intended to permit
the provinces time to acquire the equipment for roadside testing and to train
personnel in the use of it. It was conceded, however, by the Attorney General
of British Columbia that the failure to proclaim s. 234.1  in force in the
provinces of British Columbia and Quebec after an elapse of more than seven
years from the date of its enactment could not be justified on this basis.

 

18.                     The
Attorney General of British Columbia and the respondent, who adopted his
submissions on this issue, advanced a somewhat different federal objective in
justification of the non‑universal proclamation and application of s.
234.1 . It was submitted that because of the impact of s. 234.1  on provincial
law enforcement priorities and allocation of resources in the operationally
concurrent or overlapping field of highway traffic control, it was reasonable
to ascribe to Parliament, in enacting s. 102(3) of the Criminal Law
Amendment Act, 1975, an intention that the Governor in Council should have
authority to make the proclamation of s. 234.1  in a particular province
dependent on the agreement of that province.

 

19.                     The
Attorney General of British Columbia submitted with leave of the Court an
affidavit which showed that British Columbia did not agree to the proclamation
of s. 234.1  because the province preferred to pursue its own program for the
detection and deterrence of impaired driving, which included a provision in s.
203 of the Motor‑vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253, for roadside
licence suspension. In the reply to the federal inquiry as to when the province
wished s. 15 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1975, which enacted s.
234.1 , to be proclaimed in force in British Columbia, it was said: ""With
regard to section 15 , we do not wish to have this section proclaimed in force
in this Province. With section 203 of our Motor Vehicle Act presently extant,
we feel that this is not a necessary technical aid which would be of any great
assistance to us as things presently stand."" The affidavit sets out
statistics concerning the incidence and consequences, in accident, injury and
public expense, of impaired driving in British Columbia, as well as the effects
of the provincial ""Counterattack Program"" designed to reduce it, and
tends to support the submission of the Attorney General of British Columbia
that the question whether s. 234.1  should be proclaimed in force in British
Columbia was viewed as one of law enforcement priorities, efficacy and
allocation of resources. In supporting the submission of the Attorney General
of British Columbia concerning the valid federal objective justifying the non‑universal
proclamation and application of s. 234.1 , the Attorney General of Ontario said:
""The selective proclamation of section 234.1  recognized a lack of
consensus as to whether the road‑side breath testing provisions would
provide for the most effective allocation of resources in the effort to reduce
the incidence of drunk driving"" and that ""in providing for the
selective proclamation of s. 234.1 , Parliament's objective was to obtain the
consent and cooperation of the provinces and to preserve the legitimate
provincial interest in experimenting in order to find the most effective means
to reduce the incidence of impaired driving.""

 

20.                     The
provincial Attorneys General emphasized that in considering whether it is
reasonable to ascribe to Parliament an intention to confer an authority to
proclaim a provision of the criminal law in force in some provinces but not in
others, one must bear in mind, as a constitutional point of departure, that Parliament
has unquestioned legislative authority under the division of powers to limit
the territorial application of the criminal law and that it has done so on
several occasions. This was affirmed by both the majority and the minority in Burnshine.
 Martland J., delivering the judgment of the majority, said at p. 705:

 

                   It is quite clear that, in 1960, when
the Bill of Rights was enacted, the concept of ""equality before the
law"" did not and could not include the right of each individual to insist
that no statute could be enacted which did not have application to everyone and
in all areas of Canada. Such a right would have involved a substantial
impairment of the sovereignty of Parliament in the exercise of its legislative
powers under s. 91 of the British North America Act and could only have
been created by constitutional amendment, or by statute. In my opinion the
wording of the Bill of Rights did not do this, because, as has already
been noted, by its express wording it declared and continued existing rights
and freedoms. It was those existing rights and freedoms which were not to be
infringed by any federal statute. Section 2 did not create new rights. Its
purpose was to prevent infringement of existing rights. It did particularize,
in paras. (a) to (g), certain rights which were a part of the
rights declared in s. 1 , but the right claimed by the respondent does not fall
within any of those seven paragraphs.

 

The
legislative authority of Parliament, under the division of powers, to give a
territorial limitation to the application of the criminal law was also affirmed
by Laskin J. (as he then was), dissenting, as follows, at p. 715:

 

                   As a matter of legislative power
only, there can be no doubt about Parliament's right to give its criminal or
other enactments special applications, whether in terms of locality of
operation or otherwise. This has been recognized from the earliest years of
this Court's existence: see, for example, Fredericton v. The Queen
[(1880), 3 S.C.R. 505].

 

Given
this unquestioned authority and its exercise from time to time, the general
rule in s. 7  of the Criminal Code  that its provisions apply throughout
Canada does not, as suggested by the appellants in this appeal and in Hufsky,
preclude, as a matter of construction, an intention on the part of Parliament
to authorize the proclamation of a particular provision of the criminal law in
force in some provinces but not in others.

 

21.                     As
was held in Burnshine and Negridge, the burden is on the person
invoking s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights to show that an
inequality created by federal legislation is not justified by a valid federal
objective. In view of the reasons suggested by the provincial Attorneys General
why Parliament may be presumed to have empowered the Governor in Council to
proclaim s. 234.1  in force in a particular province only if the province agreed
to its proclamation, I do not think that burden has been discharged. In my
opinion, it is reasonable to ascribe those reasons and that intention to
Parliament, in enacting s. 102(3) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1975,
and they constitute, for the purposes of s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill
of Rights, a valid federal objective justifying the non‑universal
proclamation and application of s. 234.1  of Criminal Code . Accordingly,
the fact that s. 234.1  was in force in Ontario but not in force in British
Columbia and Quebec when the appellant was charged in December 1983 did not
infringe the right to equality before the law recognized by s. 1(b) of
the Canadian Bill of Rights.

 

                                                                   IV

 

22.                     I
turn now to the appellant's contention based on s. 7  of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms , which provides:

 

                   7. Everyone has
the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be
deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice.

 

23.                     The
appellant contends that the right to equality before the law is a principle of
fundamental justice within the meaning of s. 7 , and that the non‑universal
proclamation and application of s. 234.1  of the Criminal Code , which
provides for imprisonment, thus infringes the right not to be deprived of
liberty except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

 

24.                     The
initial position taken by the respondent and the interveners with respect to
the contention based on s. 7  of the Charter  is that to find
constitutional protection for the right to equality before the law under s. 7 
in the present case would be contrary to the clear expression of legislative
intention resulting from ss. 15  and 32(2)  of the Charter  that the
constitutional protection of this right was not to take effect until April 17,
1985.

 

25.                     I
agree with this contention. I do so on the basis of the clear intention of the
framers of the Charter  as to when the constitutional protection of the
right to equality before the law was to take effect, not on the basis of the
maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, which was applied in R.
v. Speicher, Kivell and Rodney (1983), 6 C.C.C. (3d) 262, to which we were
referred by counsel for the respondent and the interveners. As this Court has
observed, there may be some overlap between s. 7  and other provisions of the Charter .
It would be wrong, however, in my opinion, in view of the clear expression of
legislative intention, to give effect to such protection as s. 7  might
otherwise afford to the right to equality before the law in a case to which s.
15  could not apply because it was not in force at the relevant time. I note
that the constitutionality, under s. 15  of the Charter , of the non‑universal
proclamation and application of provisions of the criminal law, including s.
234.1 , has been considered in several cases, notably by courts of appeal in R.
v. Hamilton (1986), 57 O.R. (2d) 412 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Frohman
(1987), 56 C.R. (3d) 130 (Ont. C.A.), and R. v. Hardiman (1987), 35
C.C.C. (3d) 226 (N.S.C.A.) Leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of
the Ontario Court of Appeal in Hamilton was sought on issues other than
the constitutionality of the non‑universal proclamation and application
of the criminal law provisions in question and refused, [1987] 1 S.C.R. ix. If
that issue were to be determined under s. 7  of the Charter  on the basis
that equality before the law was a principle of fundamental justice within the
meaning of that provision, it would inevitably have the effect of determining
the issue for the purposes of s. 15  as well, since the analysis, including the
application of s. 1 , if necessary, would be essentially the same under the two
provisions. This further reinforces my conviction that it would be wrong to
apply s. 7  in the present case, in view of the clear expression of legislative
intention that the constitutional protection of the right to equality before
the law was not to take effect until April 17, 1985.

 

26.                     For
these reasons I would dismiss the appeal and decline to answer the
constitutional questions on the ground that s. 7  does not apply to the issue
raised in the appeal.

                   Respondent
offered to sell an organ for a Washington couple and was given possession of it
for thirty days for this purpose. The organ was to be returned on the expiry of
that period if it had not been sold. The organ was not sold nor was it
returned. The owners were unsuccessful in locating either the respondent or the
organ. Respondent was arrested in Seattle, Washington, pleaded guilty to theft
in the second degree, and was sentenced to the maximum term of five years'
imprisonment. He escaped custody some months later and came to Canada.

 

                   Authorities
in the State of Washington commenced proceedings to have respondent extradited
pursuant to the Canada‑U.S.A. Extradition Treaty, 1976. Respondent
was committed for extradition. His application to the British Columbia Supreme
Court for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid to quash the
warrant of committal was denied but the British Columbia Court of Appeal
allowed his appeal.

 

                   The
central issue here was whether the double criminality rule requires the elements
of the extradition crime to be the same in the requesting and the requested
state or whether it merely requires the act charged to be a listed crime in
both countries.

 

                   Held (Beetz,
McIntyre and Le Dain JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per Estey,
Lamer, Wilson and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ.: The double criminality rule is
conduct‑based. If it can be established that the fugitive's conduct
constituted the listed offence of theft in both Canada and Washington, the
double criminality requirement is met.

 

                   Respondent
was convicted in Washington of theft in the second degree. This crime, on its
face, does not include the requirement of fraudulent intent whereas theft in
Canada, as defined in the Criminal Code, expressly contains this
requirement. Accordingly, on the wording of the relevant statutory provisions,
absent further knowledge of the Washington law of theft in the second degree,
respondent's conduct would not constitute the offence of theft had it taken
place in Canada.

 

                   Double
criminality can be established in two ways. First, expert witnesses could be
called to testify that while fraudulent intent is not a requirement apparent on
the face of the Washington statute, it is nevertheless required by the law of
Washington. If this could be shown, then evidence of a conviction under
Washington law would constitute evidence that the fugitive's conduct would have
amounted to theft under Canadian law. No such expert evidence was led here.
Secondly, it could be established that the particular facts underlying the
Washington charge would, if replicated in Canada, constitute an offence under
either s. 283(1)  or s. 290(1)  of the Criminal Code . This was not done
either.

 

                   The
extradition judge did not find on the facts evidence of fraudulent intent but
inferred such intent from the non‑return of the goods. Such an inference
cannot be made because failure to return goods within a reasonable time is
consistent with a number of explanations other than fraud. Appellant therefore
failed to establish that the respondent was convicted in Washington of an
extradition crime. Respondent's committal for extradition was not authorized by
s. 18(1) (a) of the Extradition Act .

 

                   Per Beetz,
McIntyre and Le Dain JJ. (dissenting): The test for determining whether conduct
would constitute a crime in Canada is essentially the same in the case of a
convicted fugitive as it is in the case of an accused fugitive: whether the
conduct underlying the conviction, as it is described in the material before
the extradition judge, could support a conviction of the crime in Canada. Under
the applicable test the conduct underlying the conviction in the State of
Washington would constitute the crime of theft in Canada because the evidence
of that conduct before the extradition judge would support an inference of
fraudulent intent.

 

                   The
failure to comply with the requirements of Article 9(2) of the Canada‑U.S.A.
Extradition Treaty, 1976, did not render the committal invalid because it
did not go to the jurisdiction of the extradition judge.

                   APPEAL
from a judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, Vancouver Registry CA
003221, June 10, 1985, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Ruttan J.,
Vancouver Registry, CC 841383, November 15, 1984, denying an application for habeas
corpus with certiorari in aid with respect to a warrant for
committal for extradition issued by Cowan Co. Ct. J. sitting as extradition
judge, Vancouver Registry, CC 831355, August 3, 1984. Appeal dismissed, Beetz,
McIntyre and Le Dain JJ. dissenting.

 

                   William
H. Corbett, Q.C., for the appellants.

 

                   Barry
Long, for the respondent.

 

                   The
reasons of Beetz, McIntyre and Le Dain JJ. were delivered by

 

1.                       Le Dain J.
(dissenting)‑‑I would allow the appeal. While I agree with Justice
Wilson that what is in issue is whether the conduct underlying the conviction
in the State of Washington would constitute the crime of theft in Canada, I am
unable, with great respect, to agree with her conclusion that the evidence of
that conduct before the extradition judge would not support an inference of
fraudulent intent.

 

2.                       There
is obviously a necessary difference in the wording of s. 18(1) (a) and
18(1) (b) of the Extradition Act , the one referring to the proof
of conviction in the case of a convicted fugitive, the other referring to the
evidence that would justify committal for trial in the case of an accused
fugitive. I am unable, however, to conclude from this necessary difference in
wording that the test or standard for determining whether the conduct
underlying the conviction in the foreign state would constitute a crime in
Canada should, or as a practical matter can, be essentially different from the prima
facie test applicable in the case of an accused fugitive. In the
application of that test to a case of conviction the extradition judge is not
in the position of determining guilt or innocence or weighing the evidence any
more than he is in the case of an accused fugitive. In the case of a convicted
fugitive the test must be whether the conduct underlying the conviction, as it
is described in the material before the extradition judge, could support a
conviction of the crime in Canada. As long as inferences can be drawn from the
facts as established, it is irrelevant whether or not a particular trier of
fact would do so.

 

3.                       The
extradition judge described the relevant facts as disclosed by the documentary
material before him as follows:

 

                   The circumstances of the case against
Johnson were before the trial judge at the time of sentencing and appear in the
material filed. They disclose that in February 1979 a Mr. and Mrs. George Ford
of Enumclaw, Washington, placed an ad in a Seattle newspaper offering to sell
an organ. They were contacted by Johnson who persuaded them to enter into a
thirty day consignment agreement with him and to deliver the organ to him. Two
low offers were received and communicated to the Fords who turned them down.
One week after the thirty day period had expired the Fords tried to contact
Johnson but he had disappeared, as had the organ. Johnson was later located in
Calgary, Alberta. Johnson remained at large until arrested in 1982.

 

4.                       In
determining whether the conduct described by those facts would constitute the
crime of theft in Canada, the extradition judge, in my respectful opinion,
correctly applied the applicable test in the following passages of his reasons
for judgment:

 

                   In my opinion those facts are such as
to provide prima facie proof that the Canadian crime of theft, either under s.
283  or s. 290(1)  of the Criminal Code , was committed. The element of fraud can
be inferred by the failure to return the goods within a reasonable time.

 

                   Johnson in an affidavit filed in
these proceedings deposed to facts which, if believed, would negate the element
of fraudulent intent. It is not the function of the extradition judge to weigh
or consider different views of the evidence but for the purposes of the proof
of double criminality to assess whether there is sufficient prima facie
evidence to establish the commission of a Canadian crime.

 

5.                       The
failure to return the organ within a reasonable time, from which the
extradition judge held that an inference of fraudulent intent could be drawn,
must be seen in light of the fact that both Johnson and the organ had
disappeared and that he could not be located until he was arrested in 1982. The
circumstances in R. v. DeMarco (1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 369 (Ont. C.A.),
which was relied on by the respondent and is applied by Wilson J., were
materially quite different and so was the issue. In DeMarco, a married
woman with four children rented a car on June 19, 1971, for the purpose of
moving. The rental agreement stipulated that the car was to be returned the
next day, but it was not returned until the police reclaimed it near the
accused's house on July 16th. At the trial the accused testified that she never
intended to steal the car. After moving she had filled out a forwarding address
card at the post office, and then used the car to drive her children to school
from time to time, and to take them on vacation. She testified that she
""just assumed they knew that I had the car"", and that she was
intending to return it and pay for it one month after she rented it, i.e., July
19th, three days after it was seized. The Ontario Court of Appeal quashed the
conviction and ordered a new trial on the grounds, stated by Martin J.A. at pp.
373 and 374, that the trial judge's direction to the jury ""failed to make
clear to the jury that if the accused had any honest belief in a state of facts
which if they existed would constitute a legal justification or excuse for her
retaining the car such belief itself negatived theft"" and that ""there
was non‑direction amounting to misdirection in failing to direct the jury
with respect to what was necessary to be proved in order to satisfy the
requirement of a fraudulent intention on the part of the appellant in
accordance with the authorities . . . .» In my respectful
opinion, DeMarco is not authority for the proposition that an inference
of fraudulent intent could not be drawn from the failure to return the organ in
the circumstances of the present case.

 

6.                       Having
come to this conclusion on the principal issue, it is necessary for me to
address the respondent's alternative contention that the failure of the
requesting state to comply with all the requirements of Article 9(2) of the Canada‑U.S.A.
Extradition Treaty, 1976, rendered the committal by the extradition judge
invalid. Article 9(2) provides that the request for extradition shall be
accompanied by, inter alia, ""the text of the laws of the requesting
State describing the offense and prescribing the punishment for the
offense."" The information by which the respondent was charged referred to
s. 9A.56.020(1)(a) of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW), but the
request for extradition was not accompanied by the text of that provision,
although it was accompanied by the text of other provisions of the Revised
Code of Washington respecting the crime of theft in the second degree,
which were placed before the extradition judge. In my opinion the failure of
the requesting state to comply with Article 9(2) of the Treaty did not affect
the jurisdiction of the extradition judge to issue a warrant for committal
pursuant to s. 18(1) (a) of the Extradition Act . Article 9(2)  is
directed, as Article 9(1)  indicates, to the request for extradition through
diplomatic channels and not to the proceedings before an extradition judge.
There is nothing in the relevant provisions in ss. 10  and following of the Extradition
Act  to suggest that compliance with Article 9(2) of the Treaty is a
condition precedent to the exercise of the extradition judge's jurisdiction.
That it is not is an implication of the cases, with which I agree, in which it
has been held that it is not necessary to place the request for extradition in
evidence before an extradition judge: Re Von Einem and Federal Republic of
Germany (1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d) 440 (B.C.C.A.) I am accordingly of the view
that the failure to comply with Article 9(2) of the Treaty did not render the
committal invalid.

 

7.                       For
these reasons I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of
Appeal and restore the warrant of committal issued by Cowan Co. Ct. J.

 

                   The
judgment of Estey, Lamer, Wilson and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ. was delivered by

 

8.                       Wilson J.‑‑This
appeal requires us to consider the precise nature of the double criminality
rule in extradition law. The question is whether the party seeking extradition
must establish that the offence charged in the foreign state is an offence in
Canada or whether it is sufficient to show that the conduct charged would have
amounted to a Canadian crime listed in the Treaty had it taken place in this
country.

 

I The
Facts

 

9.                       On
May 18, 1979, the respondent was charged in the State of Washington with the
crime of theft in the second degree. The information reads as follows:

 

                   I, Norm Maleng, Prosecuting Attorney
for King County in the name and by the authority of the state of Washington, by
this Information do accuse Melford Keith Johnson, of the crime of theft in the
second degree, committed as follows:

 

                   That the defendant Melford Keith
Johnson, in King County, Washington, on or about February 20, 1979, with intent
to deprive another of property to wit: a Lowrey Organ, did exert unauthorized
control over such property belonging to Mr. and Mrs. George Ford; that the
value of such property did exceed $250:

 

                   Contrary to RCW
9A.56.040(1)(A).020(1)(a), and against the peace and dignity of the state of
Washington.

 

The
material facts underlying the charge are as follows. In February 1979 a
Washington couple, the Fords, placed an advertisement in a Seattle newspaper
offering to sell a ""Lowrey"" organ. The respondent Johnson offered to attempt
to sell it for them. Johnson and the Fords entered into an agreement giving
Johnson possession of the organ for thirty days after which he was to return
the organ if it had not been sold. During the thirty‑day period Johnson
referred two offers to the Fords; the Fords rejected the offers because they
were too low.

 

10.                     At
the expiry of the thirty‑day period the organ was not returned. The Fords
attempted to locate Johnson and the organ but were unsuccessful on both counts.

 

11.                     Johnson
was arrested in Seattle, Washington, on May 8, 1982. He pleaded guilty to the
offence of theft in the second degree and was sentenced to the maximum term of
five years' imprisonment. On December 26, 1982 Johnson escaped from prison. He
left the State of Washington and came to Canada. At the time of his escape
fifty‑two months of his sentence remained to be served.

 

12.                     Authorities
in the State of Washington commenced proceedings to have Johnson extradited
pursuant to the terms of the Canada‑U.S.A. Extradition Treaty, 1976.
On September 7, 1983, an information was sworn before a Vancouver extradition
judge stating that Johnson was a convicted fugitive who had escaped from
custody in Washington. The judge issued a warrant for the apprehension of
Johnson pursuant to s. 10(1) of the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑21.
Johnson was arrested on September 13, 1983, and was released on bail pending
the extradition hearing. After a number of delays the hearing was finally held
on July 27, 1984, before Cowan Co. Ct. J. sitting as an extradition judge.

 

II The
Courts Below

 

British
Columbia County Court

 

13.                     On
July 27, 1984, Cowan Co. Ct. J. ordered Johnson committed for extradition. He
noted that no warrant for committal of Johnson to await extradition could issue
unless it was established that Johnson had been convicted of an
""extradition crime"" as defined in s. 2  of the Extradition Act 
and Article 2 of the Canada‑U.S.A. Extradition Treaty, 1976. The
critical point to be determined in order to resolve this issue, he stated, was
whether the offence met the ""double criminality"" requirement of
Article 2 of the Treaty.

 

14.                     Cowan
Co. Ct. J. held that it did. He rejected the argument that the double
criminality rule required that the offence charged have an equivalent in the Criminal
Code  of Canada. ""It is sufficient"", he said, ""to produce
prima facie evidence of facts that amount to a Canadian crime listed in the
treaty"". Applying this test he held that the . . . ""facts are such as
to provide prima facie proof that the Canadian crime of theft, either under s.
283  or s. 290(1)  of the Criminal Code , was committed. The element of fraud can
be inferred by the failure to return the goods within a reasonable time"".
Double criminality, therefore, could be made out despite the fact that there
was no evidence that the Washington offence of theft in the second degree
contained an element of fraudulent intent.

 

15.                     Cowan
Co. Ct. J. also rejected the respondent's argument that his committal would
constitute a violation of his rights under s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms . The respondent did not argue s. 7  in this Court.

 

 

British
Columbia Supreme Court

 

16.                     The
respondent applied for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid to
quash the warrant of committal made by Cowan Co. Ct. J. Ruttan J. denied the
application concluding that Cowan Co. Ct. J. had correctly stated and applied
the double criminality rule.

 

British
Columbia Court of Appeal

 

17.                     Taggart
J.A. for the Court allowed Johnson's appeal. He concluded that, while the lower
courts correctly stated the double criminality rule, they applied it
incorrectly because it was not established that Johnson's conduct would have
constituted the offence of theft had it taken place in Canada. The record
provided no evidence of the fraudulent intent necessary for a conviction under
s. 283(1)  or s. 290(1)  of the Criminal Code . Taggart J.A. stated:

 

                   Now, unfortunately, what is missing
from the material is anything showing what must be proved in Washington State
to support a conviction for second degree theft. Certainly s. 9A.56.040 makes
no reference to the element of fraudulent intent. The information which I have
quoted makes averments which appear not to be included in the section. From
that I assume, but making it clear that I have no way of knowing with
certainty, there are other statutory provisions in Washington State setting out
with more particularity what must be proved in order that a conviction for
second degree theft may be entered. Those other provisions, if they exist, are
not before us. Without them, I am unable to say the appellant was convicted of
an extradition crime as required by s. 18(1)(a) of the Act. Unless one can say
with certainty that he was convicted of an extradition crime, and I cannot, the
order sought by the Washington State authorities ought not to be made.

 

He later
qualified this by stating:

 

My brother Lambert has quite correctly pointed out that
in the course of my reasons for judgment I said unless we can say with
certainty that the appellant was convicted of an extradition crime in the State
of Washington the extradition order sought by the Washington authorities ought
not to be made. I think the term certainty is much too strong. It would have
been preferable to say only that there is before us, and there was before the
extradition judge, no evidence from which the conclusion could be drawn that an
extradition crime had been committed by the appellant in the State of
Washington.

 

The
Court of Appeal therefore allowed the appeal, quashed the warrant of committal
and ordered Johnson released from custody. His release was made subject to
""the proviso that the appellant is not at the present time necessarily
detained to answer other charges that may be pending against him"".

 

III The
Issue

 

18.                     The
issue in this appeal is whether the British Columbia Court of Appeal erred in
concluding that there was no evidence that Johnson committed an extradition
crime in the State of Washington. In order to determine this we must examine
the nature of extradition crimes generally and the double criminality rule in
particular.

 

(a) Extradition
Crimes

 

19.                     The
extradition of convicted fugitives between Canada and the U.S. is governed by
Canada's Extradition Act  and by the Canada‑U.S.A. Extradition
Treaty, 1976. Section 3  of the Extradition Act  provides:

 

                   3. In the case of any
foreign state with which there is an extradition arrangement, this Part applies
during the continuance of such arrangement; but no provision of this Part that
is inconsistent with any of the terms of the arrangement has effect to contravene
the arrangement; and this Part shall be so read and construed as to provide for
the execution of the arrangement.

 

This
section of the Act incorporates the Treaty into domestic law. Extradition must
therefore be conducted in accordance with both the Act and the provisions of
the Treaty: see Government of the Republic of Italy v. Piperno, [1982] 1
S.C.R. 320, at p. 324.

 

20.                     Committal
for extradition is authorized by s. 18(1)  of the Extradition Act  which
provides:

 

                   18. (1) The judge
shall issue his warrant for the committal of the fugitive to the nearest
convenient prison, there to remain until surrendered to the foreign state, or
discharged according to law,

 

(a) in the case of a fugitive alleged to have
been convicted of an extradition crime, if such evidence is produced as would,
according to the law of Canada, subject to this Part, prove that he was so
convicted, and

 

(b) in the case of a fugitive accused of an
extradition crime, if such evidence is produced as would, according to the law
of Canada, subject to this Part, justify his committal for trial, if the crime
had been committed in Canada.

 

Thus,
the requirement for a committal under para. (a) is simply proof that the
fugitive has been convicted of an extradition crime. ""Extradition
crime"" is defined by s. 2  of the Extradition Act  read in
conjunction with Article 2(1) of the Canada‑U.S.A. Extradition Treaty,
1976. These two provisions read as follows:

 

                   2. ...

 

""extradition crime"" may mean any crime that,
if committed in Canada, or within Canadian jurisdiction, would be one of the
crimes described in Schedule I; and, in the application of this Act to the case
of any extradition arrangement, ""extradition crime"" means any crime
described in such arrangement, whether or not it is comprised in that Schedule;

 

                                                               Article
2 

 

(1) Persons shall be delivered up according to the
provisions of this Treaty for any of the offenses listed in the Schedule
annexed to this Treaty, which is an integral part of this Treaty, provided these
offenses are punishable by the laws of both Contracting Parties by a term of
imprisonment exceeding one year.

 

Among
the crimes listed in Schedule 1 to the Extradition Act  are the
following:

 

                   5. Larceny or theft;

 

                   7. Obtaining money or goods, or
valuable securities, by false pretences;

 

                   9. Fraud by a bailee, banker, agent,
factor, trustee, or by a director or member or officer of any company, which
fraud is made criminal by any Act for the time being in force; [Emphasis
added.]

 

It would
appear, therefore, that the offence of which Johnson was convicted was listed
in the Schedule annexed to the Treaty under one or more of the above items.
Article 2(1) of the Treaty, however, requires that the offences be
""punishable by the laws of both Contracting Parties"". This is the
double criminality rule, the precise nature of which is in issue on this
appeal.

 

(b) The
Double Criminality Rule

 

21.                     The
central issue to be addressed in determining the nature of the double
criminality rule is whether the rule requires the elements of the extradition
crime to be the same in the requesting and the requested state or whether it
merely requires the act charged to be a listed crime in both countries. Cowan
and Ruttan JJ. in the courts below believed that the latter was adequate. The
Court of Appeal seems to have disagreed and proceeded on the basis that the
elements of the crime must be the same in both states. Which is correct?

 

22.                     The
learned writers seem to be in agreement that the double criminality rule looks
to the conduct of the individual whose extradition is being sought. Gerald V.
La Forest, in his text Extradition To and From Canada (2nd ed. 1977),
defines an extradition crime as follows at p. 42:

 

An extradition crime may broadly be defined as an act of
which a person is accused, or has been convicted, of having committed within
the jurisdiction of one state that constitutes a crime in that state and in the
state where that person is found, and that is mentioned or described in an
extradition treaty between those states under a name or description by which it
is known in each state. This definition can be broken down into several
propositions:

 

(1)               the act charged must have been
committed within the jurisdiction of the demanding state;

 

(2)               it must be a crime in the
demanding state;

 

(3)               it must also be a crime in the
requested state; and

 

(4)               it must be listed in an
extradition treaty between the two states under some name or description by
which it is known in each state.

 

I read
the word ""it"" in each of paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) as referring
back to ""the act charged"" in paragraph (1); that is, we are directed
to examine the conduct which gave rise to the conviction or charge in the
foreign state.

 

23.                     Ivan
A. Shearer, in his text Extradition in International Law, 1971, also
emphasizes the conduct‑based nature of the test. He states at
p. 137:

 

The basic rule observed by the enumerative and `no list'
treaties alike is the rule of double criminality. This rule requires that an
act shall not be extraditable unless it constitutes a crime according to the
laws of both the requesting and the requested States.

 

24.                     The
double criminality rule has not received a great deal of judicial attention in
Canada. However, it was addressed in Cotroni v. Attorney General of Canada, [1976]
1 S.C.R. 219. In that case the issue was whether conspiracy to import a
narcotic was an extradition crime within the meaning of the Extradition Act .
This Court held that conspiracy to import narcotics fell into the list of
offences laid down in the extradition arrangement between Canada and the United
States. The Court then proceeded to the double criminality issue. It found that
the accused could have been charged under a Canadian Criminal Code provision
had his conduct taken place in Canada. Spence J. stated for the unanimous Court
at p. 222:

 

                   I am of the opinion that it matters
not whether the particular indictment, had it been laid in Canada, would have
been laid under the provisions of the Criminal Code  or the Narcotic
Control Act or in fact any other statute. The test is what is the essence
of the crime charged.

 

It is
clear that the Court did not require an exact identity between the offence
charged in the requesting state and the Canadian offence. This case, therefore,
seems to support the proposition that the double criminality rule focusses on
the criminal conduct of the person whose extradition is being sought.

 

25.                     This
position is bolstered by a consideration of the purpose of the double
criminality rule. Ivan A. Shearer suggests in his text that the double
criminality rule has its roots in the doctrine of reciprocity. He states at pp.
137‑38:

 

                   The validity of the double
criminality rule has never seriously been contested, resting as it does in part
on the basic principle of reciprocity, which underlies the whole structure of
extradition, and in part on the maxim nulla poena sine lege. For the
double criminality rule serves the most important function of ensuring that a
person's liberty is not restricted as a consequence of offences not recognized
as criminal by the requested State. The social conscience of a State is also
not embarrassed by an obligation to extradite a person who would not, according
to its own standards, be guilty of acts deserving punishment. So far as the
reciprocity principle is concerned, the rule ensures that a State is not
required to extradite categories of offenders for which it, in return, would
never have occasion to make demand. The point is by no means an academic one
even in these days of growing uniformity of standards; in Western Europe alone
sharp variations are found among the criminal laws relating to such matters as
abortion, adultery, euthanasia, homosexual behaviour, and suicide. [Emphasis
added.]

 

Thus,
following this reasoning, if it could be established that the conduct of the
fugitive constituted the listed offence of theft in both Canada and Washington
the double criminality requirement would be met.

 

26.                     I
would agree, therefore, with the appellant's contention that the double
criminality rule is conduct‑based.

 

IV The
Application of the Rule

 

27.                     Mr.
Johnson was convicted in Washington of theft in the second degree. This offence
is defined as follows:

 

9A.56.040. Theft in the second degree

 

                   (1) A person is guilty of theft in
the second degree if he commits theft of:

 

                   (a) Property or services which
exceed(s) two hundred and fifty dollars in value, but does not exceed one
thousand five hundred dollars in value; or

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (2) Theft in the second degree is a
class C felony.

 

The
Washington law, it will be noted, does not on its face include the requirement
of fraudulent intent. The Criminal Code  sections that define the crime
of theft in Canada do, however, expressly contain this requirement. The
relevant sections read as follows:

 

                   283. (1) Every one
commits theft who fraudulently and without colour of right takes, or
fraudulently and without colour of right converts to his use or to the use of
another person, anything whether animate or inanimate, with intent,

 

(a) to deprive, temporarily or absolutely, the
owner of it or a person who has a special property or interest in it, of the
thing or of his property or interest in it,

 

(b) to pledge it or deposit it as security,

 

(c) to part with it under a condition with
respect to its return that the person who parts with it may be unable to
perform, or

 

(d) to deal with it in such a manner that it
cannot be restored in the condition in which it was at the time it was taken or
converted.

 

                   290. (1) Every one
commits theft who, having received anything from any person on terms that
require him to account for or pay it or the proceeds of it or a part of the
proceeds to that person or another person, fraudulently fails to account for or
pay it or the proceeds of it or the part of the proceeds of it accordingly.

 

                   294. Except where otherwise
provided by law, every one who commits theft

 

                                                                    ...

 

(b) is guilty

 

(i) of an indictable offence and is liable for
imprisonment for two years, or

 

(ii) of an offence punishable on summary conviction,

 

where the value of what is stolen does not exceed two
hundred dollars.

 

Accordingly,
on the wording of the relevant statutory provisions, absent further knowledge
of the Washington law of theft in the second degree, it cannot be said that
Johnson's conduct would give rise to a conviction for theft had it taken place
in Canada.

 

(a) The
Case for the Appellant

 

28.                     It
was the position of counsel for the appellant in this Court that neither the Extradition
Act  nor the Canada‑U.S.A. Extradition Treaty, 1976 required
proof of the elements of the crime in the requesting state or a correspondence
of such elements with the elements of the crime under the laws of Canada. The
Court of Appeal erred in thinking that they did. All that had to be shown, the
appellant submitted, was that the offence of which the fugitive had been
convicted was listed in the Treaty, i.e., theft, and that ""theft"" is
an offence under the Criminal Code . The double criminality rule, he
submitted, required only that the conduct be criminal in both States but not
that the elements of the offences be the same. In other words, ""theft in
the second degree"" in the State of Washington does not have to equate
""theft"" under the Criminal Code  of Canada.

 

29.                     Counsel
for the appellant relied on the House of Lord's decision in In re Nielsen,
[1984] 1 A.C. 606, for the proposition that proof of the law of the requesting
state was not required on an extradition hearing, only a description of the
conduct leading to the conviction in that state. The sole issue was whether
that conduct would constitute a crime in Canada also. He pointed out that the
extradition judge in this case, having reviewed the conduct of the fugitive,
concluded: ""In my opinion those facts are such as to provide prima facie
proof that the Canadian crime of theft, either under s. 283  or s. 290(1)  of the
Criminal Code , was committed. The element of fraud can be inferred by the
failure to return the goods within a reasonable time"".

 

(b) The
Case for the Respondent

 

30.                     Counsel
for the respondent directed our attention to the difference between s. 18(1) (a)
and s. 18(1) (b) of the Extradition Act . Section 18(1) (a),
he pointed out, deals with the circumstance where the fugitive has been convicted
in the foreign state and s. 18(1) (b) with the circumstance where the
fugitive has been charged in the foreign state. He submitted that where
there had been a conviction, as in this case, the only question is whether the
offence of which the fugitive was convicted is an extradition crime. Where,
however, the fugitive has merely been charged in the foreign state the
requirements are different. Not only must he have been charged with an
extradition crime but such evidence must be produced ""as would, according
to the law of Canada . . . justify his committal for trial, if the crime had
been committed in Canada"". It is, counsel submitted, under s. 18(1) (b)
that the issue of prima facie proof justifying committal arises. It does
not arise under s. 18(1) (a) which is the applicable provision in this
case. I would respectfully agree with this submission.

 

31.                     Counsel
submitted further that there are two ways in which the appellant could
establish under s. 18(1) (a) that the crime of which the fugitive had
been convicted was an extradition crime. He could prove the foreign law under
which the fugitive was convicted. This would have to be done in the manner
required for proof of foreign law in a Canadian court. This route was not
followed. Or he could produce the description of the conduct for which the
fugitive was convicted and it could then be determined whether or not that same
conduct taking place in Canada would constitute the offence here. This was
done. However, the description of the conduct for which he was convicted did
not, counsel for the respondent submitted, constitute an offence under either
s. 283(1)  or s. 290(1)  of the Criminal Code . A necessary element for a
conviction under either of these sections was a fraudulent intent and there was
nothing in the description of the conduct for which the fugitive was convicted
in the State of Washington to indicate the presence of such an intent.
Accordingly, he submitted, counsel for the appellant failed to prove that the
offence of which the fugitive was convicted was an ""extradition
offence"" within the meaning of the Extradition Act  and the Canada‑U.S.A.
Extradition Treaty, 1976.

 

32.                     I
agree with the respondent that there are two methods by which double
criminality could be established for the purposes of s. 18(1) (a). First,
it could be established that Washington law required fraudulent intent for a
conviction of the offence charged. This could be done either by showing that
the text of the offence includes a requirement of fraudulent intent or by
calling expert witnesses to testify that while fraudulent intent is not a
requirement apparent on the face of the Washington statute, it is nevertheless
required by the law of Washington. If either of these be shown, then evidence
of a conviction under Washington law would constitute evidence that the
fugitive's conduct would have amounted to theft under Canadian law. In this
case, however, the text of the foreign law provided by the requesting state
pursuant to Article 9(2) of the Treaty did not show that the Washington law
required fraudulent intent. Neither was any expert evidence called on this
issue.

 

33.                     The
second method of showing that the double criminality requirement had been met
would be to establish that the particular facts underlying the Washington
charge would, if replicated in Canada, constitute an offence under either s.
283(1)  or s. 290(1)  of the Criminal Code . This was not done either. The
facts underlying the Washington charge were laid out in the affidavits before
the extradition judge. However, the extradition judge did not find that the
facts contained evidence of fraudulent intent. He concluded rather that
""the element of fraud can be inferred by [sic] the failure to
return the goods within a reasonable time"". With respect, I disagree with
this conclusion. The failure to return goods within a reasonable time is
consistent with a number of explanations other than fraud. The non‑return
could be due to forgetfulness, error or inability. The element of fraud cannot
in a criminal prosecution be inferred from the fact of non‑return alone:
see, for example, R. v. DeMarco (1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 369 (Ont. C.A.)

 

34.                     I
would conclude, therefore, that the appellant has failed to establish that the
respondent was convicted in Washington of an extradition crime. It follows that
s. 18  of the Extradition Act  does not authorize his committal for
extradition.

 

35.                     The
appeal is accordingly dismissed. Costs were not asked for and I would, in any
event, make no order as to costs.

Appellant, charged with speeding under the Saskatchewan Vehicles
Act, made an application in the Provincial Court to enter a plea in French,
to have his trial proceeded with in that language, and to have the hearing
delayed until the relevant provincial statutes could be produced in French. The
application was based on s. 110 of The North-West Territories Act which
provides that ""Either the English or the French language may be used by
any person in the debates of the Legislative Assembly of the Territories and in
the proceedings before the courts; … and all ordinances made under the Act
shall be printed in both those languages… ."" Appellant maintained that
this provision still applies to the courts and the Legislature of Saskatchewan
by virtue of s. 16 of the Saskatchewan Act. The Provincial Court
judge denied appellant's application. He held that s. 110 of The North-West
Territories Act was applicable to the Saskatchewan courts and entitled
appellant to use the French language before the Provincial Court and to be
provided with an interpreter. But he also held that appellant was not entitled
to be provided with statutes printed in French because the requirement in s.
110 regarding the publication of laws was in terms restricted to the
Territorial Assembly and had no application to the Saskatchewan Legislature.
When asked to enter a plea, appellant indicated that he wished to stand mute.
The trial judge entered a plea of not guilty and the trial was conducted
entirely in English. No interpreter was present because appellant took the
position that having an interpreter did not comply with s. 110 and that he
could not defend himself without access to the relevant statutes printed in
French. Appel-

[Page 236]

lant was convicted and his appeal by way of stated case to the
Court of Appeal was dismissed.

Held (Estey and McIntyre JJ. dissenting): The appeal
should be allowed.

Per Dickson C.J. and Beetz, Lamer, Wilson, Le Dain and
La Forest JJ.: Parliament, in establishing the province of Saskatchewan out of
the North-West Territories, provided under s. 16 of the Saskatchewan Act
for the general continuation of pre-existing laws except in so far as those
laws were inconsistent with the Saskatchewan Act, or in so far as the
Act contained provisions as a substitute therefor. Since Parliament did not
expect these laws to continue forever, it empowered the appropriate
legislature, in accordance with the division of legislative power, to repeal or
amend such laws. Section 110 of The North-West Territories Act was a law
existing at the establishment of the province. Since no provision of the Saskatchewan
Act was inconsistent with s. 110 or was intended as a substitute for it,
and since there was no amendment of the provisions of that section with respect
to the language of the statutes and of the proceedings in the courts, it
follows that s. 110 continues in effect for that purpose and that the statutes
of Saskatchewan must be enacted, printed and published in English and French
and that both languages may be used in the Saskatchewan courts.

The view that s. 16 did not operate to continue the provisions
of s. 110 relating to the Territorial Assembly involves a misunderstanding of
the nature of provisions for the continuation of laws. In according rights to
persons to speak English or French in the North-West Territories in 1877, the
legislation necessarily had to be addressed to the then existing institutions—the
Territorial Assembly and courts. To continue the laws establishing these
rights, which s. 16 generally purports to do, it was obviously necessary to
apply them to the successor institutions. In any event, the broad wording used
in s. 14 of the Saskatchewan Act was intended to cover in a general and
comprehensive way the laws governing the operation of the legislature. Thus the
Saskatchewan Act, either by virtue of s. 14 alone or read in conjunction
with s. 16, provided for the continuance of all laws governing the legislature
that were not inconsistent with the Act.

[Page 237]

The English language did not become the language of the courts
of the North-West Territories, and later of the Saskatchewan courts, by virtue
of the English statute of 1731, which prescribed that all proceedings in the
courts be in English only. The 1886 amendment to The North-West Territories
Act providing for the reception date of English law as of 1870 never had
the effect of incorporating this statute as part of the law of the Territories
because any existing law on the language of the courts was impliedly repealed
by s. 110 which fully covered the subject-matter. There was, therefore, no law
regarding the language of the courts to be continued in Saskatchewan other than
s. 110. The section was not repealed as no mention whatsoever was made of
language in the various Acts that restructured the Saskatchewan judicial
system. In particular, s. 110 was not impliedly repealed merely because certain
rules of court and court forms were written on the assumption that the judicial
system would operate in English.

While s. 110 governs procedural matters, it does not serve
merely procedural ends. It embodies procedural rules that give rights to
individuals. The courts have treated laws giving expression to human rights as
being of an almost constitutional nature. Repeal of such laws requires
""clear legislative pronouncement"". Language rights are a well-known
species of human rights and should be approached accordingly.

Section 110 was not entrenched after the Saskatchewan Act
was passed. The express words of ss. 14 and 16(1) of the Saskatchewan Act
clearly provide that the laws continued under the Act are subject to repeal by
the appropriate legislature. Not only is the province empowered to legislate
respecting procedure in the courts under s. 92(14)  of the Constitution Act,
1867 , it is also given power to amend its constitution under s. 45  of the Constitution
Act, 1982 .

The language rights accorded by s. 110 of The North-West
Territories Act are substantially the same as those accorded under s. 133 
of the Constitution Act, 1867 , s. 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870
and ss. 16  to 18  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . Under
s. 110, an accused is constitutionally entitled to speak French before the
courts in Saskatchewan, but has no right to be understood in that language. The
judge and all court officials can use English or French as they wish, both in
oral and in written communication. The 

[Page 238]

accused has no right to a translator, except as required for a
fair trial either at common law or under ss. 7  and 14  of the Charter . The right
to be understood is not a language right but one arising out of the
requirements of due process. Finally, when proceedings are required by law to
be recorded, a person using one or the other official language has the right to
have his remarks recorded in that language. Accordingly, in this case,
appellant was entitled to use French in the Provincial Court, but he could not
require the others to do so. As there was no evidence to indicate that he
needed the services of a translator to understand the proceedings, a fair trial
could be conducted without making a translation available from English to
French.

As to appellant's request that a French version of the
relevant statutes be produced, it was obvious that he sought valid statutes,
not mere unofficial translations. The statutes of Saskatchewan must, by virtue
of the province's constituent statute, the Saskatchewan Act, be enacted,
printed and published in English and French. Since the statutes of Saskatchewan
were not enacted in the manner and form required by its constituent statute, it
follows that they are invalid. The principle of the rule of law and the de
facto doctrine, however, will keep the existing laws temporarily in effect
for the minimum time necessary for the statutes to be translated, re-enacted,
printed and published in French or for the legislature to amend its
constitution by enacting a bilingual statute removing the restrictions imposed
on it by s. 110 and then declaring all existing laws valid notwithstanding that
they were enacted, printed and published in English only. The principle of the
rule of law would have also preserved the enforceability of appellant's
conviction. But, in this case, the trial judge's failure to comply with
appellant's request to have his plea entered in French vitiated the trial. He
sought to use French, and had a right to have his plea entered in that
language. His subsequent refusal to enter a plea was consequential to this. The
conviction should be quashed.

Per Estey and McIntyre JJ. (dissenting): Parliament
made provision in the Saskatchewan Act for a new legislature and courts
in the new province. In doing so, Parliament, pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Act,
incorporated by reference the laws of the North-West Territo-

[Page 239]

ries into the laws of Saskatchewan except where the
Territories' laws were inconsistent with the Act or where there was a substitute
in the Act. Parliament, in so exercising its authority under the Constitution
Act, 1871, refrained from establishing any language rights in the new
province. Indeed, unlike the situation resulting from the presence of s. 23 in
the Manitoba Act, 1870, there was no constitutional impediment or
restriction on the exercise by the new province of its free legislative will
under s. 92  of the Constitution Act, 1867  as regards the use of language
in the legislature and the courts. In these circumstances, it would be unusual
to find that s. 110 of The North-West Territories Act was introduced
into the Constitution of Saskatchewan by an indirect and convoluted process so
as to achieve the Manitoba result.

Section 16(1) of the Saskatchewan Act did not incorporate
s. 110 into the laws of Saskatchewan. Section 3 of the Saskatchewan Act
provided that the ""provisions of the Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1886
shall apply to the province of Saskatchewan"", except the provisions, like
s. 133  of the Constitution Act, 1867 , which are ""specially
applicable to … one or more and not the whole of the said provinces"".
Section 3  gave the new province full plenary powers to establish its courts and
legislature as it saw fit, free from the restrictions in s. 133 . Section 16(1)
of the Saskatchewan Act could not therefore indirectly repeal s. 3  by
requiring the new legislature established in Saskatchewan to operate under the
regime of s. 133 .

Further, the courts established in Saskatchewan by Parliament
acting under s. 2 of the Constitution Act, 1871 were substitutes for the
courts described in the laws of the North-West Territories and accordingly
those laws relating to courts of the Territories were not, by the terms of s.
16(1), brought into the new province. These new 'courts of Saskatchewan' were
put in place to carry on a function under s. 92(14)  of the Constitution Act,
1867 . Section 110 , which was either a precautionary recognition of s. 133 
of the Constitution Act, 1867  or a part of the federal administration of
those territories lying outside any province under s. 4 of the Constitution
Act, 1871, was never intended to apply to courts not within federal
jurisdiction. It follows that s. 110 was only intended to apply to the courts
of the North-West Territories and to no successor courts. It also follows that
the provisions in that section relating to the printing of laws in French
applied only to the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories. The
Legisla-

[Page 240]

ture of Saskatchewan established by ss. 12 to 15 of the Saskatchewan
Act was a completely new institution and the laws relating thereto were in
substitution for the laws relating to the legislature in the North-West
 Territories prior to 1905. This conclusion is supported by s. 14 of the Saskatchewan
Act which provides that the laws of the North-West Territories relating to
the ""constitution"" and the ""election of members"" of the
Legislature of the North-West Territories shall apply to the Legislative
Assembly of Saskatchewan. This section would be unnecessary if s. 16(1) of the Saskatchewan
Act carried forward all the laws of the North-West Territories, including
s. 110, into Saskatchewan. Also, section 14 did not incorporate s. 110 into the
laws of Saskatchewan for s. 110 was not a provision of a North-West Territories'
law relating to the ""constitution"" of the Legislature of the
Territories.

By the terms of s. 16(1) itself, s. 110 did not qualify for
incorporation by reference into the laws of the new province. As there was
nothing in the Saskatchewan Act addressing the use of language in the
province's courts or legislature, the exclusive provincial legislative
sovereignty under the Constitution remained untrammelled by any provisions of
the Saskatchewan Act. The application of s. 110 would be a
curtailment of the institutions created and the authority granted to the
legislature of the new province by the Saskatchewan Act and,
accordingly, was inconsistent with the Act.

In short, the language guarantees found in s. 110 were
specific to the Legislature and the courts of the North-West Territories. Saskatchewan,
like all provinces, acquired the power to establish its institutions when it
was created, including the power to specify the language to be used in their
proceedings. Section 110 of The North-West Territories Act cannot
reasonably be read as having the effect of altering by inference the
constitutional division of powers provided for in both the Constitution Act,
1867  and the Saskatchewan Act.

Finally, even assuming that s. 110 was incorporated into the
laws of Saskatchewan, the section would still have no application to the
proceedings of that province's courts and legislature. Indeed, if s. 110 became
part of Saskatchewan law, it did so instantaneously with the termination of the
existence of the only two institutions to which it applied. The Legislature of
the North-West Territories was replaced under s. 12 of the Saskatche-

[Page 241]

wan Act and the courts were replaced under s. 16 of the
same Act. Thus section 110 became simultaneously spent as regards the
legislature and the courts of Saskatchewan with its introduction into Saskatchewan
law. Furthermore, Parliament also simultaneously ""disestablished"" the
Supreme Court of the North-West Territories even as it applied to the
Territories.

The judgment of Dickson C.J. and
Beetz, Lamer, Wilson, Le Dain and La Forest JJ. was delivered by

La Forest J.—This case raises
several important questions: whether a French-speaking person accused of a
provincial quasi-criminal offence under a Saskatchewan statute has the right to
use French at his trial; whether he has the right to have the trial conducted
in that language; whether the statutes of that province are required to be
published in both English and French; whether such rights are constitutionally
entrenched; and the content of any such rights.

Background

The case arises out of the
following facts. The appellant, Father Mercure, was charged with speeding
contrary to s. 139(4) of The Vehicles Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. V-3, and was
issued a summons under the provisions of The Summary Offences Procedure Act,
R.S.S. 1978, c. S-63. On his appearance in the Provincial Court, his counsel
applied for permission to enter a plea to the charge 

[Page 245]

in the French language, to have
his trial proceeded with in that language, and to have the hearing of the
charge delayed until such time as the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly for the
province of Saskatchewan could produce the relevant statutes printed in the
French language.

There is no law of the provincial
legislature dealing with these issues; nor is there any express provision in
the province's constituent Act, the Saskatchewan Act, S.C. 1905, c. 42,
regarding the matter. Saskatchewan, however, was not created in a legal vacuum. Before
its establishment it formed part of the North-West Territories, the constituent
Act of which, The North-West Territories Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 50, as
amended, contained a provision, s. 110, rather similar to s. 133  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 , which provided for the use of English and French in proceedings
before the Territorial Assembly and the courts and requiring the use of both
languages in the Assembly's records and journals as well as the printing of its
laws in those languages. The provision was re-enacted in 1891 (S.C. 1891, c.
22, s. 18), and as so framed was in effect at the establishment of the
province. It reads as follows:

110. Either the English or the French language may be
used by any person in the debates of the Legislative Assembly of the
Territories and in the proceedings before the courts; and both those
languages shall be used in the records and journals of such Assembly; and
all ordinances made under this Act shall be printed in both those languages:
Provided, however, that after the next general election of the Legislative
Assembly, such Assembly may, by ordinance or otherwise, regulate its
proceedings, and the manner of recording and publishing the same; and the
regulations so made shall be embodied in a proclamation which shall be
forthwith made and published by the Lieutenant Governor in conformity with the
law, and thereafter shall have full force and effect. [Emphasis added.]

Counsel for the appellant
maintained that this provision applies to the courts and the Legislature of
Saskatchewan by virtue of s. 16 of the Saskatchewan Act which (like s.
129 of the Constitu-

[Page 246]

tion Act, 1867) continues existing laws, subject to their being
repealed by the appropriate legislature. Section 16(1), so far as immediately
relevant, reads:

16. (1) All laws and all orders and regulations made
thereunder, so far as they are not inconsistent with anything contained in this
Act, or as to which this Act contains no provision intended as a substitute
therefor, and all courts of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and all
commissions, powers, authorities and functions, and all officers and
functionaries, judicial, administrative and ministerial, existing immediately
before the coming into force of this Act in the territory hereby established as
the province of Saskatchewan, shall continue in the said province as if this
Act and The Alberta Act had not been passed; subject, nevertheless,
except with respect to such as are enacted by or existing under Acts of the
Parliament of Great Britain, or of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland, to be repealed, abolished or altered by the
Parliament of Canada, or by the Legislature of the said province, according to
the authority of the Parliament or of the said Legislature…

Judge Deshaye, who heard the case
at first instance, agreed that the effect of these provisions was to permit
Father Mercure to use French in the court: (1981), 44 Sask. R. 43 ,
[1981] 4 W.W.R. 435. Section 110 of The North-West Territories Act, in
his view, was continued by s. 16 of the Saskatchewan Act so far as the
languages of the courts were concerned. But that right, he held, would be
satisfied by making an interpreter available. He also held that the requirement
in s. 110 regarding the publication of laws was in terms restricted to the
Territorial Assembly and had no application to the Legislature of Saskatchewan.
Father Mercure not having made a plea, the judge entered a plea of not guilty
and the trial was conducted entirely in English, following which Father Mercure
was found guilty of the charge and convicted. No interpreter was present
because the appellant took the position that having an interpreter did not
comply with s. 110 and that he could not defend himself without access to the 

[Page 247]

relevant statutes proclaimed and
printed in the French language.

An appeal to the Saskatchewan
Court of Appeal, heard by a five person panel, was dismissed: (1985), 44 Sask. R. 22,
24 D.L.R. (4th) 193, 23 C.C.C. (3d) 140, [1986] 2 W.W.R. 1. A majority (Bayda
C.J.S., Brownridge, Tallis and Cameron JJ.A.) came to substantially the same
conclusion as the trial judge regarding the continuance of language rights. In
dissent, however, Hall J.A. concluded that s. 110 continued in effect only
during the transitional period when the province was being established.
However, he noted that if he was in error on this point, he did not think the
requirements relating to the conduct of the trial would be satisfied by merely
supplying an interpreter, but would require simultaneous translation from one
language to the other. Assuming such error, he further thought the statutes of Saskatchewan
would have to be printed in both English and French; the language of s. 110, in
his view, was clear on this point.

Father Mercure was granted leave
to appeal to this Court but he died before the appeal could be heard. This
Court, however, then authorized the intervener associations to continue the
appeal as principal parties. The Attorney General for Alberta,
which province is in a similar situation to Saskatchewan, intervened, as did
the Freedom of Choice Movement. The Court stated the following constitutional
questions:

1. Does s. 110 of The North-West
Territories Act (54 & 55 Vict., c. 22, s. 18) continue to apply, in
whole or in part, to the province of Saskatchewan by virtue of s. 16 of the Saskatchewan Act?

2. If the answer to Question
1 is affirmative, do the rights which are derived from s. 110 of The North-West
Territories Act form part of the Constitution of Canada or can they be
modified unilaterally by Saskatchewan and if so to what extent?

3. If the answer to Question
1 is affirmative, does s. 110 of The North-West Territories Act require Saskatchewan
to print its laws in English and in French?

[Page 248]

4. If the answer to Question
1 is affirmative, does s. 110 of The North-West Territories Act afford a
party pleading in a court of Saskatchewan the right to use either English or
French?

5. If the answer to Question
1 is affirmative, does s. 110 of The North-West Territories Act require that the
proceedings be conducted in English or French at the option of the accused or
defendant?

6. If the answer to Question
4 is affirmative, does the right to use either English or French before the
courts of Saskatchewan include, by virtue of s. 110 of The North-West
Territories Act, the right to be understood by the judge or judge and jury
without the assistance of an interpreter or simultaneous translation?

Legislative History

In my view, this case can be
resolved simply by the application of the ordinary principles of statutory
construction. However, all parties stressed the legislative history of the
appropriate provisions and grounded some of their arguments in that history. At
all events, it forms a useful backdrop for a consideration of the central
issues and is of assistance in revealing legislative purpose. For much of the
following historical discussion, I have relied upon Claude-Armand Sheppard, The
Law of Languages in Canada (1971), c. I-C (a study of the Royal Commission
on Bilingualism and Biculturalism).

When the four original provinces
were united by the Constitution Act, 1867 , the territory now comprising
Saskatchewan did not, of course, form part of Canada but was part of the vast
area known as Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory
originally ceded to the Hudson's Bay Company in 1670 which still exercised all
governmental powers over the area at Confederation. However, s. 146 of that Act
contemplated the transfer of these Territories to Canada.
Accordingly, these lands were surrendered by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1868 (Rupert's
Land Act, 1868 (U.K.), 31 & 32 Vict., c. 105), and in 1870 the Territories
were admitted into the Union pursuant to an Imperial Order in Council; see
R.S.C. 1970, App. II, No. 9. In the interim, Canada had passed a rudimentary 

[Page 249]

Act for their temporary
administration (S.C. 1869, c.3).

The impending changes were not viewed
with favour by the people in the Territories, most of whom lived in the Red
River area of what is now Manitoba. Many of them were French-speaking and had been
accustomed to considerable governmental services in their own language, both by
the Council of Assiniboia, which exercised governmental functions in the Red
River area, and in the courts. From about 1835, the Council of Assiniboia began
publishing its resolutions by reading them aloud in English and French
(Sheppard, op. cit., at pp. 73-76), and from about 1855, local representation
on the Council was on a roughly equal English and French basis (see Mason Wade,
The French Canadians 1760-1967 (rev. ed. 1968), vol. 1, at p. 397).
Similarly the courts counted a number of bilingual judges.

After some tense confrontations,
in which demands were made that English and French be used in the legislature
and that judges speak both languages, the Canadian government acceded to the
demands of the people of the Territories. To that end, Canada
enacted the Manitoba Act, 1870, S.C. 1870, c. 3, which created the province of
Manitoba out of the Red River settlement and surrounding lands, and by s. 23,
provided certain guarantees regarding the use of the English and French
languages in the Manitoba Legislature and in its courts. The background in Manitoba is
set forth in Reference re Manitoba Language Rights, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 721,
at pp. 731-32. For a detailed account of the situation in the Territories
generally, see also Sheppard, op. cit., at pp. 77-79.

I should add here that while s.
146  of the Constitution Act, 1867  provided for the admission of those
Territories into the Union, it made no specific provision for the manner in
which Parliament could deal with them. To settle the doubts surrounding this
question, the Constitution Act, 

[Page 250]

1871 (U.K.), 34 & 35 Vict., c. 28, was enacted. This Act by
s. 2 gave Parliament power to create new provinces and by s. 5 confirmed the Manitoba
Act, 1870. More important for
present purposes, it also provided, by s. 4, that Parliament could make
provision for the administration, peace, order and good government of any
territory not for the time being included in any province.

The first North-West Territories Act, enacted in 1869 (S.C.
1869, c. 3) before this enabling legislation, said nothing about the language
of the courts or the legislature. This is scarcely surprising owing to its
temporary and rudimentary character. Nor were any such provisions enacted in The
North-West Territories Act, 1875, S.C. 1875, c. 49, which amended and
consolidated earlier enactments for the governance of the Territories. In 1877,
however, while some unrelated amendments were being made, the first version of
s. 110 was added to the amending Bill in the Senate; see S.C. 1877, c. 7, s.
11. That provision read as follows:

11. Either the English or the French language may be
used by any person in the debates of the said Council, and in the proceedings
before the Courts, and both those languages shall be used in the records and
journals of the said Council, and the ordinances of the said Council shall be
printed in both those languages.

The amendment was not sponsored
by the Government. Rather it was introduced in the Senate by Senator Girard of
Manitoba who stated that this was desirable because there were as many French
as English people in the Territories; see Debates of the Senate, 1877,
at p. 319 (the debate is reproduced by Belzil J.A. (dissenting) in R. v.
Lefebvre (1986), 48 Alta. L.R. (2d) 124, at p. 138); see also Debates of
the House of Commons, 1905, at p. 8576 (Laurier), and at p. 8607 (Brodeur).
The amendment was rather grudgingly accepted by the Government when it came up
for consideration in the House of Commons in order to avoid delaying the Bill
for another session (see Debates of House of Commons, 1890, at p. 1002 

[Page 251]

(Watson)). But there is no
suggestion that the Government had any objection to the amendment as such.
Rather, as Mr. Mills, speaking for the Government, stated, it regretted the
amendment because it had thought this was a matter best left to the Council in
question; see Debates of the House of Commons, 1877, at p. 1872; see
also the Debates of 1905 at p. 8531 (Monk). This policy was probably grounded
in the dominant attitude in Quebec that language rights should be left to the
local governments rather than to Parliament; see in this context A. I. Silver, The
French-Canadian Idea of Confederation, 1864-1900 (1982), esp. cc. 7-10.

There appears to be a suggestion
in the factums of the respondent and the Attorney General for Alberta that
s. 110 was in some way inextricably linked with the language guarantees in s.
133  of the Constitution Act, 1867 . I am unable to fully understand the
basis of this argument. If section 133 applied, it would apply proprio
vigore. If the courts of the North-West Territories are courts for the better administration
of the laws of Canada under s. 101  of the Constitution Act, 1867 ,
then s. 133  applies to them without more. If it does not apply to these courts,
there is no requirement in s. 133  for Parliament to enact a provision like s.
110 . I have combed the appropriate pages of Hansard and have found
nothing that would lead to the view that s. 110  was enacted to give effect to
s. 133 , although some years later Laurier stated that one of the reasons s. 110 
was not repealed in 1890 was that s. 133  guaranteed similar rights in relation
to the courts; see Debates of the House of Commons, 1905, at p. 8579.
Indeed, the impression one gets is that at the time s. 110  was enacted, s. 133 
was thought to have no application for, as we saw, Mr. Mills who made the
motion in the House concurring in the Senate amendment, stated that he
regretted that the amendment had been made because they (the Government) had
thought that this was a matter which was better left to the Territorial
Council. However that may 

[Page 252]

be, s. 110 was separately enacted
by Parliament and continued in its own right.

The notion that the local
authorities might legally deal with these language issues is not really
surprising. Certainly, the language of debate in the Assembly was not covered
by s. 133  of the Constitution Act, 1867 , since that provision was in
this regard aimed specifically at the federal Parliament and the Quebec
Legislature. So far as the languages to be used in the courts and in statutes
are concerned, it is true that in time this Court, using Lord Sankey L.C.'s
""living tree"" analogy (from Edwards v. Attorney-General for
Canada, [1930] A.C. 124 (P.C.)), extended the requirements of s. 133  to
administrative tribunals and regulations in Attorney General of Quebec v.
Blaikie, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 1016, at p. 1029. But it must be remembered that
in 1877 the living tree was a mere sapling. Besides there is a world of
difference between mere appendages of the federal and Quebec
governments and vast quasi-separate areas possessing democratic institutions
for their governance, and it is altogether natural that the statesmen of the
time might not have viewed the matter in this expansive light. It should be
noted that there had been sufficient doubt regarding the application of federal
laws to the Territories to prompt the Imperial Parliament in 1871 to expressly
confer on the Canadian Parliament power to make laws for the administration,
peace, order and good government of any territory not for the time being
included in any province; see s. 4 of the Constitution Act, 1871. This
broad power would include the establishment of courts for the administration of
law in the Territories, a matter of considerable significance when it is observed
that s. 133  is in terms confined to ""any Court of Canada established under
this Act"", i.e., the Constitution Act, 1867  (specifically the
courts established under s. 101  for the administration of the laws of Canada)
and the courts of Quebec. It is by no means self-evident, therefore, that s.
133  had any application to the Territories. What is clear is that the
historical forces that engendered s. 110  

[Page 253]

were quite separate from those
which resulted in the language compromise of 1867 regarding federal and Quebec
governmental institutions (s. 133 ).

Some have suggested that there is
a specific connection between s. 110 and the demands of the settlers at the
time of the transfer of the Territories to Canada. Thus during the debates
preceding the Saskatchewan Act, Mr. Monk (Debates of the House of
Commons, 1905, at pp. 8530 et seq.) stated that s. 110, like s. 23
of the Manitoba Act, 1870, was made in response to the demands made by
the people in the Territories, but others have contested it (id., at p. 8548
(Lemieux)). The justifications given by its sponsor, Senator Girard, to the
effect that this was desirable on the grounds of justice because there were as
many French as English people in the Territories must have been seen as reason
enough at the time. It is right to say, however, that this consideration could
not have been completely foreign to those to whom it applied, for it would
appear that many of the French speaking Manitobans who had made the list of
demands before Manitoba was created had moved to that portion of the
Territories that is now Saskatchewan and Alberta (see Belzil J.A., dissenting,
in R. v. Lefebvre, supra, at p. 137, dealing with the parallel situation
in Alberta; Silver, op. cit., at p. 132, states that French settlement from
outside the Prairies after Confederation was not extensive; see also Wade, op.
cit., at p. 405).

The 1877 amendment was re-enacted
in 1880 as s. 94 of The North-West Territories Act, 1880, S.C. 1880, c. 25, and became s. 110 of c. 50
of the Revised Statutes of Canada of 1886. The law, however, remained
substantially as it was before. In early 1890, however, a Bill was introduced
by Mr. Dalton McCarthy for the removal of the provisions regarding the French
language; see 

[Page 254]

Debates of the House of Commons, 1890, esp. at pp. 756 (Cockburn) and 857 (McCarthy).
As counsel for the Attorney General for Alberta noted, this Bill was viewed by
its sponsor as simply the first step in a process the ultimate goal of which
was the elimination of the French language throughout the country, a process
which incidentally included the attempted abolition by Manitoba of the language
guarantees in s. 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870. For a variety of reasons,
however, the Government refused to accept the whole of Mr. McCarthy's proposal,
but it did agree to the addition of a proviso empowering the Legislative
Assembly to regulate its proceedings and the manner in which these proceedings
should be recorded and published. Section 110 thus took the form above quoted;
see S.C. 1891, c. 22, s. 18. Pursuant to this proviso, the Territorial Assembly
appears to have passed a resolution in 1892 providing that its proceedings
should be in English only, but there is doubt whether that resolution was valid
because the proper procedural steps were not followed; see Sheppard, op. cit.,
at p. 85. It is irrelevant for the purposes of this appeal to look further into
the matter, however, because the proviso does not relate to the statutes nor to
proceedings in court.

Reference may also be made to the
fact that in 1886, The North-West Territories Act was amended (S.C.
1886, c. 25, s. 3) to provide for the reception of English law in the
Territories as of 1870. Absent other legislation, this would have had the
effect of incorporating in territorial law a British statute of 1731 (4 Geo. 2,
c. 26) which provided that all proceedings in the courts of England and
Scotland shall be in the English tongue only, but this, of course, could not
take place in the face of the express provision in s. 110, so this statute
never became part of the law of the North-West Territories and in consequence
never became part of the law of Saskatchewan. The proposition that English
statutes which were repealed, or never came into effect in the Territories,
somehow revived in Saskatchewan or Alberta has been repeatedly rejected by the courts; see 

[Page 255]

Toll v. Canadian Pacific
Railway Co. (1908), 8 W.L.R. 795
(Alta. C.A.); Schultz v. Wolske (1966), 75 W.W.R. 411 (Alta. S.C.); Stevens
v. Quinney (1979), 101 D.L.R. (3d) 289 (Sask. Q.B.)

No further legislative
development took place before the establishment of Saskatchewan
in 1905. It is true, as the respondent maintained, that French in fact ceased
to be used in the debates, statutes and proceedings in the courts in 1892 (see
Sheppard, op. cit., at p. 83), some years before the establishment of the
province, but statutes do not, of course, cease to be law from mere disuse. As
Driedger puts it, ""A statute is not effaced by lapse of time, even if it
is obsolete or has ceased to have practical application""; see E. A.
Driedger, The Composition of Legislation (2nd ed. rev. 1976), at p. 110.
At all events, it does not strike me as a particularly attractive argument to
put before a court of justice that a majority can destroy the rights of a
minority by simply acting in violation of those rights. Thus, at least as it
relates to the language of statutes and proceedings in the courts, s. 110
remained fully in effect at the establishment of the province of Saskatchewan.
All the courts that have had occasion to deal with the issue are in accord with
this statement; see, in addition to the courts below in this case, R. v.
Tremblay (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 454 (Sask. Q.B.); Reference re French
Language Rights of Accused in Saskatchewan Criminal Proceedings, [1987] 5
W.W.R. 577 (Sask. C.A.) in Saskatchewan, and in Alberta where a parallel
situation exists, Paquette v. R. in Right of Canada (1985), 40 Alta.
L.R. (2d) 38 (Q.B.), aff'd (1987), 55 Alta. L.R. (2d) 1 (C.A.); R. v.
Lefebvre (1982), 21 Alta. L.R. (2d) 65 (Q.B.), aff'd (1986), 48 Alta. L.R.
(2d) 124 (C.A.)

The real question, then, is
whether s. 110 was continued in Saskatchewan by the Saskatchewan Act in 1905. In
approaching this issue, all the parties placed considerable reliance on the
debates 

[Page 256]

on the language question that
took place in the House of Commons. For example, counsel for the Attorney
General for Alberta drew attention to the remarks of Sir Wilfrid Laurier
that having regard to the small French population in the Territories he could
not argue in favour of a right to the official use of French (Debates of the
House of Commons, 1905, at p. 8577). But this remark, made in the course of
the debate on a motion by Mr. Monk to entrench French and English, cannot really
be read as supporting the view that the Saskatchewan Act was not meant
to continue the existing situation. What he appears to have meant was that this
was a matter to be left to the provincial legislature to deal with as it saw
fit. This, in fact, was what the debate was about. Monk and Henri Bourassa,
particularly, were convinced that if the province were given the power, it
would abolish the language guarantees (see id., at pp. 8850-51).

The prevailing view, however, was
that the language provisions should not be entrenched so that the legislatures
would be free to deal with the matter. Laurier himself stated that ""When
those courts shall have become provincial, we shall no longer have jurisdiction
over them, and therefore the legislature will have the right to deal with the
language in the courts as well as in the legislature"" (id., at pp. 8579-80).
The Minister of Justice, Mr. Fitzpatrick, made the position clear. In speaking
regarding s. 16 of the Alberta Act, S.C. 1905, c. 3 (which is identical
to s. 16 of the Saskatchewan Act), he remarked that the provision was
intended to maintain the existing conditions relating to the laws (id. at p.
8240). Speaking specifically of s. 110 he expressed the opinion at p. 8242 that
if

[it] is carried forward … it
would be the law as they will have it in the province after this constitutional
Act is passed. Then of course, it would become subject to the control of the
local legislature, and it will be a matter to be dealt with by them; and I say
emphatically, … that is my intention. That is, the matter as I view it, ought
to be dealt with by the local legislature…

[Page 257]

This appears to have been the
understanding on both sides of the House; see id., at pp. 8531, 8843, 8850.

As I indicated, however, while
legislative history may be useful in providing the backdrop and assisting in
determining the purpose of legislation, the interpretation of the statute must
in this as in other contexts be determined by the words used by the legislature
to convey its intent. As will be seen, however, I agree with the opinion
expressed by the then Minister of Justice and, for that matter, with that of
Sir Wilfrid Laurier.

Continuation of Laws Under the
Saskatchewan Act

One would assume that Parliament,
in carving out the province of Saskatchewan out of the North-West
 Territories, would provide for the
general continuation of laws except in so far as these were inconsistent with
the province's constituent Act. As well, since Parliament would not expect
these laws to continue forever, it would empower Parliament or the legislature,
in accordance with the division of legislative power, to repeal or amend such
laws.

That is precisely what s. 16 of
the Saskatchewan Act does. It provides that ""All laws . .. existing
immediately before the coming into force of this Act in the territory hereby
established as the province of Saskatchewan, shall continue in the said province as if this Act
and The Alberta Act had not been passed"". Then, as one would
expect, s. 16  goes on to provide that these pre-existing laws are to apply only
in so far as they are not inconsistent with anything in the Saskatchewan Act
or as to which that Act contains a substitute therefor, and empowers the
appropriate legislature to repeal or amend such laws.

Section 110 was a law at the
establishment of the province and, therefore, barring other considerations, it
continued in operation in the province. Is there anything in the Act, then,
that is either inconsistent with or intended as a substitute 

[Page 258]

for s. 110? It was argued, and on
this point the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal agreed, that
s. 16  did not operate to continue the provisions of s. 110 that related to the
Territorial Assembly. This argument, however, seems to me to involve a
misunderstanding of the nature of provisions for the continuation of laws. In
according rights to persons to speak English or French in 1877, the legislation
necessarily had to be addressed to the then existing institutions—the
Territorial Assembly and the courts in the Territories. To continue the laws
establishing these rights, which s. 16  generally purports to do, it was
obviously necessary to apply them to the successor institutions.

Precedents for thus applying
existing laws to newly created institutions are not lacking. Indeed, in this
specific area, the English Act of 1731, already mentioned, which provided that
proceedings are to be conducted in the English tongue, is specifically confined
to the ""Courts of Justice within that Part of Great Britain, called
England, and …
the Court of Exchequer in Scotland"". So
much was this provision considered to be of local application that it required
an express amendment to extend it to Wales; see Robert W. Kerr, ""Regina v.
Murphy and Language Rights Legislation"" (1970), 20 U.N.B.L.J. 35,
at p. 37. Yet the courts in several provinces have found no difficulty in
applying this provision to their courts; see R. v. Murphy (1968), 69
D.L.R. (2d) 530 (N.B.C.A.); Re Poulin (1968), 64 W.W.R. 705 (B.C.S.C.)

That the various ""laws, orders
and regulations"" continued by s. 16  would not be out of place in their
application to the new legislature is evident from the fact that this new body
functioned in much the same way as the Territorial Assembly. Section 14 of the Saskatchewan
Act so provides in the following terms:

14. Until the said Legislature otherwise determines, all
the provisions of the law with regard to the constitu-

[Page 259]

tion of the Legislative
Assembly of the North-West Territories and the election of members thereof shall apply, mutatis
mutandis, to the Legislative Assembly of the said province and the election
of members thereof respectively.

Indeed I am inclined to think
that the broad wording used in this provision was intended to cover in a
general and comprehensive way the laws governing the operation of the
legislature. Parliament obviously intended to avoid the elaborate 19th century
phraseology in which these matters are couched in the Constitution Act, 1867 
in relation to the House of Commons and the Legislatures of Ontario and Quebec,
and chose instead to adopt an approach similar to that employed in that Act in
relation to the Legislatures of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, which simply
provided that the constitution of their legislatures should continue, relying for
the rest on the general provision for the continuance of laws. Put briefly, I
am of the view that, either by virtue of s. 14  alone or read in conjunction
with s. 16 , the Saskatchewan Act provided for the continuance of all
laws governing the legislature that were not inconsistent with the Act in the
same way as other laws. There is, no doubt, some overlap but it was necessary
for Parliament to deal expressly with the Legislature and it was natural, if
only as a matter of caution, to expressly provide for continuity here in a
manner similar to the Constitution Act, 1867 .

In considering a statute like the
Saskatchewan Act, which established a new province and accorded it broad
legislative powers, we constantly need to remind ourselves of Marshall C.J.'s
admonition ""that it is a constitution [that] we are
expounding""; M'Culloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819),
at p. 407. The incongruous results that can flow from interpreting
constitutional instruments in a narrow and restricted manner can be exemplified
by Strachan v. Lamont (1906), 4 W.L.R. 411, upon which the respondent
relied and by which the Court of Appeal felt bound. The case dealt with a
controverted election following the first election of members to the new
Saskatchewan Legislature. A majority of the court held that the

[Page 260]

Controverted Elections
Ordinance of the North-West Territories
had not been continued either under s. 14 or s. 16 of the Saskatchewan Act. Chief Justice Sifton
first stated that he thought it a serious objection ""that the Ordinance …
referred in specific terms to a body, The Legislative Assembly of the North-West
Territories', which was no longer in existence, and the only power it gave the
Court was to remove and in some cases replace a member of that assembly""
(pp. 412-13). He went on to say that the word ""constitution"" in s. 14
of the Saskatchewan Act did not cover all laws in any way affecting the
legislature and that the word ""election"" applied to provisions for
electing members to the legislature, not to those for removing them when
elected.

Nor in Sifton C.J.'s view would
s. 16 of the Act cover the election or removal of members. That section, he
opined, did not apply to ""special legislation"" as was evident from
the fact that s. 14  explicitly dealt with the legislature and that s. 16(3)
continued the existence of all societies and professional associations.

I find the judgment difficult to
follow. Obviously, a new legislature had to be created and it was not unnatural
for Parliament to indicate how the relevant pre-existing laws were to apply to
this new institution, and this it did, either under s. 14  or s. 16 . Similar
provisions incidentally were made in respect of the Lieutenant-Governor and the
Executive Council (see s. 10). A general intent to continue all laws is
indicated. The structure of the Act, in fact, is not unlike that appearing in
the Constitution Act, 1867 .

The express continuation of institutions,
such as professional societies, which appears to have troubled Sifton C.J., is
not really surprising. All existing institutions of, or deriving from,
government 

[Page 261]

appear to have been expressly
continued. Though the general provision for the continuation of laws would
probably have been sufficient to carry these forward, many of these provisions
may have been added either out of an abundance of caution or, as in the case of
the legislature or joint stock companies (s. 16(4)), because it was thought
necessary to deal with these institutions for some specific purpose. Thus in
the case of the professional societies (s. 16(3)), which Sifton C.J. used to
support his notion of ""special legislation"", it was provided that
they could be abolished by the Governor in Council, not the Lieutenant-Governor
in Council as one would otherwise think would be the case. What is abundantly
clear, as one would expect, is that the Act provides for a general continuation
of laws and institutions except as otherwise dealt with in the Act, it being
left to the appropriate legislature, in express terms in almost every section,
to deal with them later as it saw fit.

Generally, I have grave
difficulty understanding what would be comprehended by the term ""special
legislation"" and how such a concept can be read into the legislation,
which makes it clear that all laws were continued unless inconsistent with the
Act or unless they were subsequently repealed. The term nowhere appears in the
Act, and it is significant that no such concept has ever developed under s. 129 
of the Constitution Act, 1867 . This judicially invented concept is quite
indefinable. Why, for example, provisions for controverted elections should be
special and not continued, thereby leading to a serious hiatus in the law is
difficult to fathom. Wetmore J. expressed the same sentiment in Strachan,
at p. 415. ""I cannot"", he said, ""bring my mind to the conclusion
that Parliament intended by the Act in question to compel the Assembly of the
province to resort to the old mode of trying out controverted elections by
means of the Assembly, or a committee thereof, and not avail themselves of the
machinery which was in force in the Territories relating to the Territorial
Assembly for the purpose of trying out such controverted elections.""
Despite this, Wetmore J., however, went on to agree with Sifton 

[Page 262]

C.J. What this reveals, as I
indicated earlier, is an approach to statutory interpretation that is wholly
out of place in the construction of constitutional instruments.

The proper approach, it seems to
me, would have been to interpret the statute broadly to effect the obvious and
sensible purpose of Parliament to continue existing laws until the new
legislature could turn its mind to them. I, therefore, much prefer the views of
the dissenting judge, Scott J., who, though somewhat uncertain about whether
""election"" should cover controverted elections, thought ""the
word 'constitution' in sec. 14  must be construed as referring to the whole body
of the laws … which relate not only to the creation and organization, but also
all those relating to its powers, duties, and privileges, and all the
limitations with respect thereto which have been enacted by the territorial
legislature itself, or by a superior legislative body"" (p. 417).
(Emphasis added.) But even the narrow interpretation of the majority will not
assist the respondent here, for Sifton C.J. explicitly recognized that an
ordinance that dealt with ""the number of legislators, quorum, election of
Speaker, rules for conduct, etc., and generally with the constitution of
the Assembly"" (emphasis added) fell within the words ""with regard to
the constitution"" in s. 14  (p. 414). It seems to me that the language of
debates and records and of the statutes plainly fall within this general
description and that the approach applies, a fortiori, to a provision,
like s. 110 of The North-West Territories Act, enacted by Parliament
itself to govern the matter. This method of approach is entirely consistent
with what this Court has had to say about the meaning of provincial
constitution in Attorney General of Quebec v. Blaikie, supra, at pp.
1023-24, and OPSEU v. Ontario (Attorney General), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 2, per
Beetz J., at pp. 37-47.

[Page 263]

I conclude, then, that the Strachan
case was clearly and fundamentally wrong and should be overruled. I am at a
loss to see what difference the Saskatchewan Legislature's relying upon it
could have made, though I rather doubt if much reliance has been placed on it
over the years. It is interesting that it has seldom been referred to in other
cases and in none would it be of assistance for present purposes.

No other argument was made that
any provision of the Saskatchewan Act was inconsistent with s. 110 of The
North-West Territories Act or intended as a substitute for it. Nor, even on
the assumption that such an amendment could be made without complying with s.
110 (a matter I will discuss later), have we been directed to any amendment of
the provisions of that section regarding the language of the statutes. The
Legislative Assembly Act, S.S. 1906, c. 4, did not, pursuant to s. 14 of
the Saskatchewan Act, exclude the application of s. 110. It follows that
s. 110 continues in effect and that the statutes of Saskatchewan
must be enacted, printed and published in English and French.

The foregoing reasoning applies a
fortiori to the courts, which are expressly continued by s. 16 of the Saskatchewan Act. As Bayda C.J.S.,
speaking for the majority of the Court of Appeal, observed, the law
""pertaining to languages, is not tied to a special institution"" in
that part of s. 110 dealing with the courts. I agree with him, therefore, that
""[t]his means that different courts can come and go but the law remains
and applies irrespective of those comings and goings."" Belzil J.A. in R.
v. Lefebvre, supra, at pp. 140-41, observed that this is, in fact, what
happened before the enactment of the Saskatchewan Act. When
section 110 was first passed, he stated, the courts which the provision
affected were those of the stipendiary magistrates, but when these were
replaced by the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories the provision continued to apply to it. In like
manner, s. 110 continued to apply when the latter court was replaced by the
Supreme Court and other courts of the province. It should be remembered that
when the Supreme Court of the Territories was con-

[Page 264]

tinued in the province, it did so
no longer as a territorial court but as a Saskatchewan court. It was disestablished in what remained of the
territories by The North-West Territories Amendment Act, 1905, S.C.
1905, c. 27, ss. 2 and 8, enacted on the same day as the Saskatchewan Act. The subsequent
restructuring of the courts in no way changed the law applicable generally to
all courts. It is interesting that the courts of Saskatchewan feel they have
sufficient bilingual capacity to conduct criminal trials in French or could
with little difficulty be organized to do so; see R. v. Tremblay, supra,
at pp. 464-65; Reference re French Language Rights of Accused in
Saskatchewan Criminal Proceedings, supra, at pp. 619-20.

It will be obvious that I do not
accept that s. 110 was somehow intended as a purely transitional measure.
Provisions like s. 16 of the Saskatchewan Act continue statutes until
repealed. We have countless laws that continue to this day by virtue of s. 129 
of the Constitution Act, 1867 . In this general context, it is
interesting that Laskin C.J.C. in Attorney General of Canada v. Canadian
National Transportation, Ltd., [1983] 2 S.C.R. 206, at pp. 224-25, noted
that the prosecutorial power of provincial Attorneys General in criminal law
matters continued for some twenty-five years by virtue of that provision.

It must also be underlined that
no mention is made of language at all in the various Acts that restructured the
Saskatchewan judicial system, so it is not easy to see how there
could be an implied repeal of s. 110. As I have already mentioned as well, it
is also not easy to understand how English would have become the language of
the courts by virtue of the 1731 English statute mentioned 

[Page 265]

above. That statute never became
law in the Territories, since any existing law on the language of the courts
was impliedly repealed by s. 110 which fully covered the subject-matter, and no
statute so repealed comes into force by the mere fact that the repealing
statute is itself abrogated. There was, therefore, no law regarding the
language of the courts to be continued other than s. 110.

All there is left, then, to
establish an inference that English is the language of the courts is that
certain rules of court and court forms were written on the assumption that the
judicial system would operate in English. But that is the same assumption, and
the same reality, that prevailed before these rules were enacted and, indeed,
before the Saskatchewan Act came into effect when, for reasons already
given, there can be no doubt that s. 110 was the law. Apart altogether from
this, can it be supposed that a rule of law so deeply rooted in the history of
this country could be swept away by a side wind like the preparation of court
forms and the like? How could a statute, particularly one so fundamental as
this, be repealed in this fashion? This is very far, indeed, from the stringent
tests that have been established to warrant a holding that a statute has been
impliedly repealed. As the court put it in The India (1865), 12 L.T.N.S.
316, at p. 316, a prior statute is repealed by implication only ""if the
entire subject-matter has been so dealt with in subsequent statutes that,
according to all ordinary reasoning, the particular provisions in the prior
statute could not have been intended to subsist""; see also Seward v.
The ""Vera Cruz"" (1884), 10 App. Cas. 59 (H.L.), at p. 68; E. A.
Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 234.

The last point I have made, and
indeed the argument regarding continuity generally, are powerfully reinforced
by the rules regarding the manner in which rights of this kind should be
approached. I begin with the well-established prin-

[Page 266]

ciple that statutes are not to be
read as interfering with vested rights unless that intention is declared
expressly or by necessary implication. Duff C.J. in Spooner Oils Ltd. v.
Turner Valley Gas Conservation Board, [1933] S.C.R. 629, put it this way,
at p. 638:

A legislative enactment is
not to be read as prejudicially affecting accrued rights, or ""an existing
status"" (Main v. Stark (1890), 15 App. Cas. 384, at 388), unless
the language in which it is expressed requires such a construction. The rule is
described by Coke as a ""law of Parliament"" (2 Inst. 292), meaning, no
doubt, that it is a rule based on the practice of Parliament; the underlying
assumption being that, when Parliament intends prejudicially to affect such
rights or such a status, it declares its intention expressly, unless, at all
events, that intention is plainly manifested by unavoidable inference.

See also Driedger, Construction
of Statutes, op. cit., at pp. 183-85.

I should observe here that while
s. 110 governs procedural matters, it does not serve merely procedural ends. It
embodies procedural rules that give rights to individuals and, in fact, those
rules are to some extent framed in terms of rights. ""Either the English or
French language"", s. 110 reads, ""may be used by any person in
the debates of the Legislative Assembly of the Territories and in the
proceedings before the courts"" (emphasis added). As well, the printing of
the records and the enactment, printing and publishing of the statutes in both
languages are not purely mechanical rules of procedure but are obviously
intended for the benefit of the individuals who use those languages. As this
Court noted in Reference re Manitoba Language Rights, supra, at p. 744,
in speaking of the duty imposed by the similarly worded s. 23 of the Manitoba
Act, 1870: ""This duty protects
the substantive rights of all Manitobans to equal access to the law in either
the French or the English language."" They are language rights or language
guarantees as all the cases in this Court from Jones v. Attorney General of
New Brunswick, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 182, to Société des Acadiens du Nouveau-Brunswick
Inc. v. Association of Parents for Fairness in Education, [1986] 1 S.C.R.
549, 

[Page 267]

make clear. A parallel situation
exists in other areas of procedural law. Thus most of the rules of evidence are
directed at purely procedural purposes, but others are aimed at protecting
certain institutions; for example, the rule against compelling spouses from
testifying against one another serves no procedural end but is grounded in the
desire to protect the marital relationship; see Hoskyn v. Metropolitan Police
Commissioner, [1979] A.C. 474 (H.L.), per Viscount Dilhorne, at p.
494 and Lord Salmon, at p. 495.

The remarks I have referred to in
the Spooner case, supra, respecting vested rights had reference
to mere property and financial concerns. The courts, and particularly this
Court, have expressed themselves in even stronger terms in the area of law
giving expression to human rights which it has treated as being of an almost
constitutional nature. Repeal of such laws requires ""clear legislative
pronouncement"", to use McIntyre J.'s words in Winnipeg
School Division No, I v. Craton, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 150, at p. 156. He there set forth
the proper approach to such legislation in the following passage at p. 156:

In any event, I am in
agreement with Monnin C.J.M. where he said:

Human rights legislation is
public and fundamental law of general application. If there is a conflict
between this fundamental law and other specific legislation, unless an
exception is created, the human rights legislation must govern.

This is in accordance with
the views expressed by Lamer J. in Insurance Corporation of British Columbia v.
Heerspink, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 145. Human rights legislation is of a special nature
and declares public policy regarding matters of general concern. It is not
constitutional in nature in the sense that it may not be altered, amended, or 

[Page 268]

repealed by the Legislature.
It is, however, of such nature that it may not be altered, amended, or
repealed, nor may exceptions be created to its provisions, save-by clear
legislative pronouncement. To adopt and apply any theory of implied repeal by
later statutory enactment to legislation of this kind would be to rob it of its
special nature and give scant protection to the rights it proclaims. In this
case it cannot be said that s. 50 of the 1980 consolidation is a sufficiently
express indication of a legislative intent to create an exception to the
provisions of s. 6(1) of The Human Rights Act.

If human rights legislation can
be said to be fundamental or almost constitutional, it is at least equally true
of the legislation at issue here; for many years it was entrenched, so far as
the inhabitants of the area to which it applied were concerned, since it could
only be removed by Parliament, not the local legislature, something, it will be
remembered, Parliament had refused to do. It formed part of the basic law of a
vast area of this country from the earliest days of the founding of the nation
and is rooted in a deeply sensitive reality recognized in the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms , which, among our fundamental constitutional values,
sets forth that English and French are the official languages of this country
(s. 16(1) ).

It can hardly be gainsaid that
language is profoundly anchored in the human condition. Not surprisingly,
language rights are a well-known species of human rights and should be
approached accordingly; see International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, G.A. Res. 2200A (XXI), 21 U.N. GAOR, Supp. (No. 16) 52, U.N. Doc.
A/6316 (1966), art. 27; M. Tabory, ""Language Rights as Human Rights""
(1980), 10 Israel Y.B. on Human Rights 167. A majority of this Court in Société des
Acadiens, supra, at p. 578, clearly expressed the view that ""language
rights belong to the category of fundamental rights"" (per Beetz
J.), a view the Court had earlier expressed in Reference re Manitoba
Language Rights, supra, in the following passage at p. 744:

[Page 269]

The importance of language
rights is grounded in the essential role that language plays in human existence,
development and dignity. It is through language that we are able to form
concepts; to structure and order the world around us. Language bridges the gap
between isolation and community, allowing humans to delineate the rights and
duties they hold in respect of one another, and thus to live in society.

The Court in the latter case went
on at pp. 744-45 to underline the judiciary's responsibility to protect the
language rights given under s. 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870 and to ensure that the government complies with the
Constitution. I also note the Court's observation that, given the similarity of
that provision to s. 133  of the Constitution Act, 1867 , the range of
application of these provisions should be parallel (pp. 743-44). Whatever power
the legislature may have to alter the provision, the similarity of language and
history of s. 110  would seem to call for the same approach.

I realize, of course, that, as in
the case of other human rights, governmental measures for the protection of
language rights must be tailored to respond to practical exigencies as well as
to the nature and history of the country. But when Parliament or the
legislature has provided such measures, it behooves the courts to respect them.
Any inroads on them should be left to the legislative branch. This is
particularly so of rights regarding the English and French languages, which are
basic to the continued viability of the nation. As Dickson C.J. put it in Société
des Acadiens, supra, at p. 564:

Linguistic duality has been
a longstanding concern in our nation. Canada is a country with both French and English solidly
embedded in its history. The constitutional language protections reflect
continued and renewed efforts in the direction of bilingualism. In my view, we
must take special care to be faithful to the spirit and purpose of the
guarantee of language rights enshrined in the Charter .

While the Chief Justice's remarks
were specifically addressed to Charter  protection, this comment is 

[Page 270]

clearly relevant here. So too are
his remarks relating to s. 16  of the Charter  which makes English and
French the official languages of Canada. He stated, at p. 565:

Despite academic debate
about the precise significance of s. 16 , at the very least it provides a strong
indicator of the purpose of the language guarantees in the Charter . By
adopting the special constitutional language protections in the Charter ,
the federal government of Canada and New
 Brunswick have demonstrated their
commitment to official bilingualism within their respective jurisdictions.

While Dickson C.J. was there
speaking for himself, the majority judgment of Beetz J. also recognized that s.
16  contained ""a principle of advancement or progress in the equality of
status or use of the two official languages"" (p. 579). Beetz J. differed
with the Chief Justice in that for him it was the legislative, rather than the
judicial process that was particularly suited to advance the principle. But
section 110 is a legislative initiative consistent with that principle and,
like other language guarantees, it must, as already mentioned, be respected by
the courts.

In my view, therefore, s. 110
continued in effect in Saskatchewan after the establishment of that province either by
virtue of s. 16(1) or of the combined effect of ss. 16(1)  and 14 . As noted
earlier, this is entirely in accord with the legislative history of these
provisions.

I shall now turn to the question
whether s. 110 is entrenched in the sense that it cannot be unilaterally
repealed by the province before entering into a discussion of what is comprised
in the rights it guarantees.

Is Section 110 Entrenched?

The appellant took the position
that s. 110 can only be repealed by virtue of an amendment to the Constitution
of Canada made under s. 43  of the Constitution Act, 1982 , i.e., by
resolutions of the Parliament of Canada and of the legislature of the

[Page 271]

province to which the amendment
applies. I do not think this proposition can stand in the face of the express
words of ss. 14 and 16(1) of the Saskatchewan Act, which clearly provide
that the laws continued under the Act are subject to being repealed by the
appropriate legislature. Not only is the province empowered to legislate
respecting procedure in the courts under s. 92(14)  of the Constitution Act,
1867 ; it is also given power under s. 45  of the Constitution Act, 1982 
to amend the constitution of the province. But that is not all. Parliament knew
full well how to entrench a provision if it wished to do so, namely, by
expressly providing for language rights in the Saskatchewan Act as it
did in the case of s. 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870. Such provisions, in
common with s. 133  of the Constitution Act, 1867 , are constitutionally
protected and do not fall within the province's legislative capacity to amend
its constitution or otherwise; see Attorney General of Quebec
v. Blaikie, supra, at pp. 1023-25.

The respondent also directed our
attention to the fact that in dealing with separate schools, Parliament
expressly provided, by s. 17 of the Saskatchewan Act, that s. 93  of the Constitution
Act, 1867  should apply to the province with the substitution of other
provisions for para. (1) of that section. That, however, seems to me to
misconstrue the applicable provisions. As Judge Deshaye observed at trial, s.
93 , like other general provisions in the Constitution Act, 1867 , was
applied to Saskatchewan by virtue of s. 3 of the Saskatchewan Act; s. 17 of that Act was
simply inserted to provide for the amendments there made. Section 110 of The
North-West Territories Act, on the other hand, was continued by ss. 14 and
16 of the Saskatchewan Act and, therefore, subject to amendment or
repeal pursuant to those provisions.

[Page 272]

For these reasons, I do not think
s. 110 was entrenched after the Saskatchewan Act was passed. This, like
my views regarding the continuation of s. 110, is entirely in accord with the
legislative history of these provisions.

I turn now to the extent of the
rights accorded under s. 110.

The Rights Under Section 110—The
Courts

Many of the questions raised about
the reach of the protections like those accorded under s. 110 have already been
determined in recent cases before this Court either under s. 133  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 , s. 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870, or ss. 16 -18  of the Charter .
All of these provisions are differently drafted but they use similar
expressions and there has been a marked tendency to give them a similar
interpretation; see, for example, the judgment of Beetz J. speaking for the
majority in MacDonald v. City of Montreal, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 460; see also
Reference re Manitoba Language Rights, supra.

The appellant argues, however,
that this approach has no application to s. 110 so far as the languages of the
courts are concerned. He notes, first of all, that while these other provisions
provide that either the English or French language may be used by any person
""in any Pleading or Process in or issuing from"" any of the
applicable courts, s. 110 provides that a person may use either of these
languages ""in the proceedings before the courts"" (emphasis
added). In his view, therefore, s. 110 is limited to procedures that take
place before the courts. This, he continues, arose out of an historical
context different from the political compromise that took place in 1867. He
draws attention to the considerable bilingual capacity among the judges in the
Territories when these Territories were transferred to Canada. The
same system was maintained, the appellant argues, after such transfer.

[Page 273]

I am unable to attach the same
significance as the appellant to this difference in phraseology. Permitting the
use of a language in proceedings before the courts is just as easily capable of
meaning that it may be used in the course of those proceedings, whether in
pleadings before the court, or in written pleadings, or in issuing process. The
provision was obviously modelled on s. 133  and though, like other provisions
similarly modelled, it differs in form, one would naturally assume it to be
aimed at achieving the same purpose. One cannot expect specific forms or
particular words to be followed religiously. This is particularly so of a
provision like this one, which was not originally introduced as a government
measure. It is interesting that the proposer of the Bill, who appears to have
confined his remarks to the legislative aspects, observed that ""the
majority of the people of the territories were French, and they had as much
right to have their language acknowledged there as they had in Quebec and
Manitoba …"" Debates of the Senate, 1877, at p. 319. I conclude,
therefore, that the language rights accorded by s. 110 are substantially the
same as those accorded under these other provisions. I turn then to examine
what has been said about these provisions in the various cases before this
Court.

Turning first to the languages of
the courts, it is settled by Société des Acadiens, supra, that while a
person is constitutionally entitled to speak French in court in New Brunswick
under s. 19(2)  of the Charter , he has no right to be understood in that
language. The judge and all court officials may use English or French as they
wish both in oral and in written communication; see also MacDonald v. City
of Montreal, supra,
at pp. 483 and 497. As I read Beetz J.'s judgment in Société des Acadiens,
the appellant has no right to a translator, except as required for a fair trial
either at common law or under ss. 7  and 14  of the Charter  (p. 577). The
right to be understood is not a language right but one arising out of the
requirements of due process. Beetz J. in Société des Acadiens carefully
employs the word ""power"" to

[Page 274]

describe the language rights
accorded an individual. He says, at p. 574: ""They vest in the speaker or
in the writer or issuer of court processes and give the speaker or the writer
the constitutionally protected power to speak or to write in the
official language of his choice"" (emphasis added). At page 575, he
contrasts this power to language provisions that provide for the right to
communicate (s. 20  of the Charter ) or to be heard (s. 13(1) of the Official
Languages of New Brunswick Act, R.S.N.B. 1973, c. O-1).

Applying these principles to the
present case, it seems to me that the trial judge could, subject to what I
shall have to say later about records, proceed with the trial in English. There
is no evidence to indicate that the appellant needed the services of a
translator to understand the proceedings, so a fair trial could be conducted
without making a translation available from English to French. At all events,
what the appellant sought throughout these proceedings was to vindicate his
language rights, not the right to a fair hearing.

Counsel for the Freedom of Choice
Movement, however, argued that the principle of equality in the use of language
is breached by employing a translator to make a person understood by the trial
judge. Such translation, he stressed, puts a person whose words must be
translated in a far less favourable position than one who can be understood
directly. However, it seems to me that this argument, too, was rejected by the
majority of this Court in Société des Acadiens. There Beetz J. had this
to say on the point at p. 580:

I do not think the
interpretation I adopt for s. 19(2) of the Charter offends the equality
provision of s. 16 . Either official language may be used by anyone in any court
of New Brunswick or written by anyone in any pleading in or process issuing
from any such court. The guarantee of language equality is not, however, a guar-

[Page 275]

antee that the official
language used will be understood by the person to whom the pleading or process
is addressed.

Before I leave this question
of equality however, I wish to indicate that if one should hold that the right
to be understood in the official language used in court is a language right
governed by the equality provision of s. 16 , one would have gone a considerable
distance towards the adoption of a constitutional requirement which could not
be met except by a bilingual judiciary. Such a requirement would have far
reaching consequences and would constitute a surprisingly roundabout and
implicit way of amending the judicature provisions of the Constitution of
Canada.

Beetz J. in that case at p. 574
and in MacDonald, supra, at pp. 500-501, was at pains to indicate that
the right to due process, which is substantially what concerns the intervener,
should not be linked with language rights because they are conceptually
different, and the effect of doing so would involve the risk of distorting both
rather than reinforcing either.

There is a matter regarding
translation, however, that was not raised in Société des Acadiens but
that does arise in this case. In the Société des Acadiens, the issue was
whether the judge understood the appellant (which it was held he did). Beetz
J., however, left to another day the issues regarding the reasonable means
necessary to ensure that the members of the courts understand the proceedings.
He also did not deal with the issue, which has some relation to the matters
just mentioned, whether when proceedings are required by law to be recorded, a
person using one or the other official language has the right to have his
remarks recorded in that language. Nor did that issue arise in MacDonald,
supra, or Bilodeau v. Attorney General of Manitoba, [1986] 1 S.C.R.
449. These cases were essentially addressed to whether processes validly made
in one only of the official languages were required to be translated in the
other. As already mentioned, however, it does arise in the present case, both
as regards the 

[Page 276]

making of a plea and the giving
of evidence by the appellant.

In my view, the appellant's right
or power to use French would be seriously truncated if recorded in another
language. For his use of the language goes beyond the immediate forum. The
proceedings, for example, may continue in the Court of Appeal where the judges
may quite properly wish to refer to the exact words used by a person at trial,
words that person has a right to use. Absent valid legislation requiring the
recording of the appellant's statements in one language only, and none was
brought to our attention, the appellant would seem to me to have a right to
have his statements recorded in the French language. His situation, of course,
differs from that of a person who uses a language other than English or French
whose rights to translation derive solely from the requirements of due process.

The Rights Under Section 110—The
Legislature

I now turn to the appellant's
request that the hearing be delayed until the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly
produce before the court the relevant statutes printed in the French language.
By the manner in which this request was made, it is obvious that he sought
valid statutes, not mere unofficial translations. On the basis of Attorney
General of Quebec v. Blaikie, supra, it is clear that for the statutes to be valid they must have been
enacted, printed and published in English and French. Since the relevant
statutes have not been enacted, printed and published in English and French, it
follows that they are invalid, unless a distinction can be drawn between the
present case and Blaikie.

There is, of course, the
difference that in Blaikie, the Court was dealing with an entrenched
constitutional provision. But, in my view, while this difference is critically
important in relation to 

[Page 277]

the manner in which the
legislature can alter the law, until it is altered, the legal situation is the
same as under Blaikie. It is inconceivable to me that when s. 110 was
enacted by Parliament, the Territorial Assembly could validly have ignored a
provision in its constituent statute regarding the manner and form in which its
laws must be enacted. An Ordinance enacted in violation of its requirement
would clearly be invalid. That provision as to the manner and form of
enactments was, we saw, continued in respect of the provincial legislature by
ss. 14 and 16 of the Saskatchewan Act, the constituent Act of the
province. A basic provision regarding the manner in which a legislature must
enact laws cannot be ignored. I cannot accept that such a provision can be
impliedly repealed by statutes enacted in a manner contrary to its
requirements, particularly one that is aimed at an accommodation of an
historically sensitive matter like the use of the English and French languages
in this country. Since the manner and form of enactment (in English and French)
was not entrenched, however, the provision may be modified or repealed, but
such repeal or modification must be made in the manner and form required by law
at the time of the amendment.

The law on this point was clearly
stated by the Privy Council in Bribery Commissioner v. Ranasinghe,
[1965] A.C. 172, in the following terms, at pp. 197-98:

[A] legislature has no power
to ignore the conditions of law-making that are imposed by the instrument which
itself regulates its power to make law. This restriction exists independently
of the question whether the legislature is sovereign, as is the legislature of Ceylon, or
whether the Constitution is ""uncontrolled,"" as the Board held the
Constitution of Queensland to be. Such a Constitution can, indeed, be altered
or amended by the legislature, if the regulating instrument so provides and if
the terms of those provisions are complied with: and the alteration or
amendment may include the change or abolition of those very provisions. But the
proposition which is not acceptable is that a legislature, once established,
has some inherent power derived from the mere fact of its establishment to make
a valid law by the 

[Page 278]

resolution of a bare
majority which its own constituent instrument has said shall not be a valid law
unless made by a different type of majority or by a different legislative
process. And this is the proposition which is in reality involved in the
argument.

That case involved the obvious
situation where the law provided for a two-thirds majority, but the Board chose
to use general words because the principle goes well beyond the confines of
that case. Sir Ivor Jennings, one of the great constitutional lawyers of this
century, thought it applied even to the United Kingdom Parliament. For him,
Parliament's power to enact any law it wishes is conditioned upon its doing so
in the manner and form provided by law; see The Law and the Constitution
(3rd ed. 1943), at pp. 138-45. It may alter that manner and form, as it did,
for example, when it reduced the powers of the House of Lords to that of delay
only, see the Parliament Act, 1911 (U.K.), 1 & 2 Geo. 5, c. 13, but
it is not without interest that the House of Lords joined in enacting this
statute. Jennings says, at pp. 144-45:

The powers of Parliament are
not expressed in an Act of Parliament. Nevertheless it is admitted, as Dicey
admits, that the powers do come from the law. The law is that Parliament may
make any law in the manner and form provided by the law. That manner and form
is provided, at present, either by the common law or by the Parliament Act of
1911. But Parliament may, if it pleases, provide another manner and form.
Suppose, for instance, that the present Parliament enacted that the House of
Lords should not be abolished except after a majority of electors had expressly
agreed to it, and that no Act repealing that Act should be passed except after
a similar referendum. There is no law to appeal to except that Act. The Act
provides a new manner and form which must be followed unless it can be said
that at the time of its passing that Act was void or of no effect.

In this country, a similar view
has been espoused by Professor Peter W. Hogg, Constitutional Law of Canada
(2nd ed. 1985), at pp. 262-64.

[Page 279]

For my part, I cannot accept that
in a nation founded on the rule of law, a legislature is free to ignore the law
in its constituent instrument prescribing the manner and form in which
legislation must be enacted. That has always been the law in this country and
in the Commonwealth generally. This was, it is true, usually justified under s.
5 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865 (U.K.), 28 & 29 Vict., c.
63; see, for example, Attorney-General for New South Wales v. Trethowan,
[1932] A.C. 526 (P.C.) That provision empowered colonial legislatures to make
laws respecting the constitution, powers and procedure of such legislatures,
but to this was added a proviso ""that such Laws shall have been passed in
such Manner and Form as may from Time to Time be required by any Act of
Parliament, Letters Patent, Order in Council, or Colonial Law for the Time
being in force in the said Colony"". It should be observed, however, that
that statute, as the name implies, was enabling; it was aimed at validating
colonial laws, not invalidating them. Parliament had deemed it wise to enact
the statute because of a restrictive judicial interpretation of colonial
legislative power in Australia; for the history of the Act, see K. C. Wheare, The
Statute of Westminster and Dominion Status (5th ed. 1953), at pp. 74-79.
Thus, the proviso was simply intended to ensure that power given by the
operative part of s. 5 did not interfere with provisions regarding ""manner
and form"" in the various legislative instruments governing colonial legislation;
see, in this context, Harris v. Minister of the Interior, [1952] 2
S.A.L.R. (N.S.) 428 (Sth. Afr. App. Div.) where manner and form restrictions
previously protected by the Colonial Laws Validity Act, were held to
continue to apply to the Parliament of South Africa notwithstanding the
attainment of that country to sovereignty and the consequent repeal of that Act
in its application there.

As I see it, the statutes of Saskatchewan
are invalid as not having been enacted in the manner and form required by its
constituent statute. That being so, Saskatchewan finds itself in a position
similar to that of Manitoba as declared in the 

[Page 280]

Reference re Manitoba Language
Rights case, supra. In that
case, it was held that the unilingual Acts of the Legislature of Manitoba were
invalid. The result of this, it was further held, is that, without more, there
would be a legal vacuum with consequent legal chaos in the province (pp. 747-48).
This would mean that in Saskatchewan the courts and all other institutions created by law
under those statutes would be acting without legal authority in so far as they
purport to exercise powers conferred by Saskatchewan statutes or Territorial Ordinances that, after 1877,
were not enacted in English and French. Indeed as the Court in the Reference
re Manitoba Language Rights, supra, further observed, questions regarding the validity
of the present composition of the legislature might also be raised (p. 748).

In the Reference re Manitoba
Language Rights, the Court, by resort to the principle of the rule of law
and the de facto doctrine, found means to keep the existing laws
temporarily in effect for the minimum period of time necessary for the statutes
to be translated, re-enacted, printed and published in French. These matters
are fully explained in that case and it is unnecessary for me to go into them
except to say that the law enunciated in that case would generally apply to the
present situation. Conforming to the procedure required for Manitoba would, of
course, remedy the situation in Saskatchewan. There is, however, the important difference that s.
110, unlike s. 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870, is not constitutionally
entrenched, so re-enacting, printing and publishing all the provincial statutes
or resorting to s. 43  of the Constitution Act, 1982  are not the only
available solutions. The legislature has the power to amend its constitution by
an ordinary statute, but in enacting such amending statute it must do so in the
manner and form required by the law for the time being in force. This, we saw,
requires that such statute be enacted, printed and published in the English and
French languages. Accordingly, the legislature may resort to the obvious, if
ironic, expedient of enacting a bilingual statute removing the restrictions
imposed on it by s. 110  and then declaring all existing provincial statutes
valid notwithstanding 

[Page 281]

that they were enacted, printed
and published in English only. Whichever option the legislature adopts, it
must, consistent with the Reference re Manitoba Language Rights, act within a reasonable time. If it opts for
translation, it must do so within the minimum period required. If it adopts the
route of statutory repeal or modification, it must, having regard to the rule
of law, undertake that step as soon as possible. It follows that the decision
regarding the option it will take must also be made expeditiously.

Disposition

As I noted earlier, the
appellant's requests at trial were three in number: that he be allowed to enter
a plea in the French language, to have the trial proceeded with in that
language, and to have the hearing delayed until the relevant statutes were
produced in the French language. Since the law regarding the second and third
requests have already been dealt with by this Court, I shall deal with these
first.

It seems to me that many of the
issues surrounding the second issue have already been dealt with in the Société
des Acadiens case. The appellant was entitled only to use French, not to
require others to do so. As to the request that a French version of the
statutes be produced, this appears to be covered by the similar case of Bilodeau
v. Attorney General of Manitoba, supra,
in relation to s. 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870.
The majority of the Court there held that the principle of the rule of law
would preserve the enforceability of the conviction of the appellant there, and
if that were all I would be prepared to follow a similar course here.

There is, however, the additional
point in the present case that the appellant requested to have his plea entered
in French. This, as I have explained, he had a right to demand and failure to 

[Page 282]

comply with his request in my
view vitiates the trial. He sought to use French, and thus had a right to have
his plea entered in French. His subsequent refusal to enter a plea later was
consequential on this.

I would, therefore, allow the
appeal with costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal, and quash the
conviction. I would reply to the constitutional questions as follows:

1. Does s. 110 of The North-West
Territories Act (54 & 55 Vict., c. 22, s. 18) continue to apply, in
whole or in part, to the province of Saskatchewan by virtue of s. 16 of the Saskatchewan Act?

A. Yes, in whole by virtue
of ss. 14 and 16 of the Saskatchewan Act.

2. If the answer to Question
1 is affirmative, do the rights which are derived from s. 110 of The North-West
Territories Act form part of the Constitution of Canada or can they be
modified unilaterally by Saskatchewan and if so to what extent?

A. Saskatchewan may unilaterally
modify s. 110 of The North-West Territories Act but such modification
must be in the manner and form required by law at the time of such
modification, currently by legislation in English and French.

3. If the answer to Question
1 is affirmative, does s. 110 of The North-West Territories Act require Saskatchewan
to print its laws in English and in French?

A. Yes.

4. If the answer to Question
1 is affirmative, does s. 110 of The North-West Territories Act afford a party pleading
in a court of Saskatchewan the right to use either English or French?

A. Yes.

5. If the answer to Question
1 is affirmative, does s. 110 of The North-West Territories Act require
that the proceedings be conducted in English or French at the option of the
accused or defendant?

[Page 283]

A. No, but statements in
proceedings made in English or French must, when recorded, be in the language
used in making the statement.

6. If the answer to Question
4 is affirmative, does the right to use either English or French before the
courts of Saskatchewan include, by virtue of s. 110 of The North-West
Territories Act, the right to be understood by the judge or judge and jury
without the assistance of an interpreter or simultaneous translation?

A. No.

The reasons of Estey and McIntyre
JJ. were delivered by

ESTEY J. (dissenting)—This appeal
raises the question whether the province of Saskatchewan is required to provide
for the use of the French language in proceedings before the Saskatchewan
courts and to provide for provincial statutes printed in French, for the
purpose of such proceedings. Because there are no language rights expressly
prescribed for Saskatchewan in the Constitution Act, 1867 , as amended,
the question before the Court in this appeal resolves itself to this: Does any
right to a trial in the French language arise under the laws of the province of
Saskatchewan by reason of the possible incorporation of s. 110 of The North-West
Territories Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 50 as amended by S.C. 1891, c. 22, s. 18,
into the laws of Saskatchewan by s. 16(1) of the Saskatchewan Act, S.C.
1905, c. 42, or otherwise, and if there be such a right is there also a right,
to receive in that connection applicable Saskatchewan statutes in the French
language?

It may facilitate the
examination of what follows in these reasons to outline the essential elements.

1. The action taken by the
Parliament of Canada in the establishment of the province of Saskatchewan stands
in sharp contrast to that taken at the time of the establishment of the province of Manitoba.

(a) Parliament, in the Saskatchewan
Act, made provision for a new legislature, courts, and an educational
system for the 

[Page 284]

new province, and in so
doing incorporated the laws of the North-West Territories into Saskatchewan
where those laws were not inconsistent with or for which there was no
substitute in the Saskatchewan Act.

(b) In so exercising its
authority under the Constitution Act, 1871 (U.K.), 34 & 35 Vict., c.
28 (originally the British North
 America Act, 1871), Parliament refrained from establishing any language
rights in the new province and indeed defeated a motion so to do.

(c) This is very different
from the action taken by Parliament in 1870 when establishing the province of Manitoba
under the Manitoba Act, 1870,
S.C. 1870, c. 3. Parliament there expressly prescribed in s. 23 the language to
be used in the legislature and in the courts of the province.

2. Language rights can only be
found in the laws of Saskatchewan if s. 110 of The North-West Territories
Act is brought into Saskatchewan by s. 16(1) or s. 14 of the Saskatchewan Act. This did not occur
because:

(a) Section 3 of the Saskatchewan
Act frees the province from s. 133  of the Constitution Act, 1867 ,
and empowers the new legislature there established in ss. 12  to 15  to adopt its
own rules of language and to establish courts without reference to any language
rights. The essence of the appellant's submission is that s. 16(1) of the Saskatchewan
Act indirectly repealed s. 3 of the same Act by requiring the new legislature
established by ss. 12  to 15  to operate under the regime of s. 133 .

(b) The legislature
established by ss. 12 to 15 inclusive of the Saskatchewan Act is a
completely new institution and the laws relating thereto are in substitution
for the laws relating to the legislature in the North-West Territories prior to
1905. To interpret either s. 14  or s. 16(1)  as incorporating 

[Page 285]

s. 110 into the laws of Saskatchewan
would be to override s. 3 of the Saskatchewan Act and the constitutional
powers thereby accorded to the new province and its legislature, including its
freedom from s. 133 . In any case, s. 14  could only act as a conduit for s. 110
if it is a law with regard to the ""constitution of the Legislative
Assembly of the North-West Territories"". The language of use in the legislature is, at
the most, a procedural element and not a constitutive element.

(c) The courts established
in s. 16  by Parliament acting under s. 2 of the Constitution Act, 1871
are substitutes for the courts described in the laws of the North-West Territories and accordingly those laws relating to courts of the Territories are
not, by the terms of s. 16(1), brought into the new province. These 'courts of Saskatchewan'
were put in place to carry on a function under s. 92(14)  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 .

(d) Section 110 by its terms
relates to specific institutions, none of which have legally survived the
transition to the province of Saskatchewan and so the section is spent. The Legislature of the North-West
Territories was replaced under s. 12, the courts were replaced
under s. 16 , and the Supreme Court of the North-West
 Territories was disestablished by
Parliament on the same day the Saskatchewan Act was enacted.

(e) Section 110 is
inconsistent with the unfettered Constitution established for the new province
under the Saskatchewan Act.

3. It is unnecessary to decide,
for the purposes of this appeal, whether the courts of the North-West
Territories, as they existed prior to the creation of the new provinces in
1905, were 'courts of Canada' to which s. 133  of the Constitution Act, 1867 
would apply, whether those courts were established under s. 101  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 , s. 4 of the Constitution Act, 1871, or otherwise.

[Page 286]

1. The Facts

The appellant, Father André Mercure,
by information sworn on December 12,
 1980, was charged with speeding on
November 6, 1980, contrary to s. 139(4) of The Vehicles Act, R.S.S.
1978, c. V-3. On January 12, 1981, Father Mercure appeared in a proceeding before the Provincial Court for Saskatchewan presided over by His Honour Judge L. P. Deshaye.
Before entering a plea, the appellant, whose native tongue was French,
requested the trial judge to conduct the entire proceedings in French. He also
requested to have the hearing delayed until the Clerk of the Legislative
Assembly of Saskatchewan could provide him with five pertinent provincial
statutes printed in French. On April 15, 1981, Judge Deshaye rendered a
decision denying the application: (1981), 44 Sask. R. 43 , [1981] 4 W.W.R.
435. Judge Deshaye held that the appellant did have the right to use the French
language before the Provincial Court, but was not entitled to be provided with the
relevant statutes printed in French. The right to the use of the French
language before the court was restricted to the provision of an interpreter.
The matter was then adjourned to April
 24, 1981, at which time Father Mercure,
when asked to enter a plea, indicated that he wished to stand mute. The judge
entered a plea of not guilty. The trial was conducted entirely in English. The
appellant did not testify at trial. The appellant was found guilty of the
charge. No interpreter was present at the trial as the appellant took the
position that having an interpreter translate the proceedings was not
sufficient recognition of his right to use the French language before the
court, and, in any event, he argued that he could not defend himself without
access to the statutes printed in French.

Father Mercure appealed by way of
stated case to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. On October 28, 1985, the Court of Appeal dismissed
the appeal: (1985), 44 Sask. R. 22, 24 D.L.R. (4th) 193, 23 C.C.C. (3d) 140,
[1986] 2 W.W.R. 1. Father Mercure then sought and obtained leave to appeal to
this Court. On April 29, 1986, Father 

[Page 287]

Mercure died. This Court then
authorized the intervener associations to continue this appeal as principal
parties.

II. The Legislative History

The central issue of this appeal
focusses upon the construction of s. 110 of The North-West Territories Act
and s. 16(1) of the Saskatchewan Act.
However, to provide an appropriate background for the interpretation of these
statutes the legislative history of these two Acts must be considered. It
should be understood at once that the courts are here largely engaged in
statutory interpretation. There is no constitutional element in this process
except in the indirect sense that the Constitution hovers over all discussion
of the plenary powers of the two levels of government. It may be helpful for
example to consider s. 133  of the Constitution Act, 1867 , and ss. 2, 4
and 6 of the Constitution Act, 1871. The task in construing the Saskatchewan
Act, being an Act of Parliament, and certain related Saskatchewan statutes
herein below identified, is not akin to the task which was before the courts
when determining the use of language in the courts of the province of Manitoba. See
Reference re Manitoba Language Rights, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 721. There the instruments before the courts were
constitutional in nature. The issue had been made the specific subject of
constitutional provisions, namely s. 23 of the Manitoba
Act, 1870, and the Constitution
Act, 1871. Nothing of that nature is here in issue.

In May 1670, King Charles II
granted a charter to The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading
into Hudson's Bay. Under the terms of this charter, the Hudson's
Bay Company was granted ""the sole trade and commerce"" of all those
territories watered by rivers flowing into Hudson's Bay. The charter also
provided that the said land ""be from thenceforth reckoned and reputed as
one of His Majesty's Plantations or Colonies in America, called Rupert's
Land"". Prince Rupert was the first governor of the Company.

[Page 288]

The territory that is now
comprised in the province of Saskatchewan
was formerly a part of the lands known as Rupert's Land and the North-Western
Territory, the latter being those British possessions lying north and west of
Rupert's Land. The British North America Act, 1867 (now entitled the Constitution
Act, 1867 ) by s. 146  authorized the Queen upon the advice of the Privy
Council of the United Kingdom and on addresses from the Houses of Parliament of
Canada to transfer to Canada both Rupert's Land and the North-Western
Territory. The Order in Council was issued on June 23, 1870 (reprinted in
R.S.C. 1970, App. II, No. 9). These lands were then administered under the Temporary
Government of Rupert's Land Act, 1869, S.C. 1869, c. 3. Under the Manitoba
Act, 1870, Manitoba
became the first province to be carved out of this territory and given the
status of a province under the Constitution Act, 1867 . This Canadian
statute was confirmed and incorporated in the Constitution by the Parliament of
the United Kingdom in the Constitution Act, 1871.

The power of the federal
government to create provinces out of federal territories was not expressly
conferred by the Constitution Act, 1867 . However, this power was granted
retroactively (and the Manitoba Act, 1870,
confirmed) by ss. 2 and 5 of the Constitution Act, 1871. The same Act,
by s. 4, conferred upon the Parliament of Canada full legislative authority
over those territories comprised in the Dominion of Canada but lying outside
any province. In 1875, Parliament enacted The North-West Territories Act,
1875, S.C. 1875, c. 49, which provided that the lands known as Rupert's Land
and the North-Western Territory (that is all the lands remaining after the
creation of the province of Manitoba)
would henceforth be known as the North-West Territories. This Act established a ""Court of
Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction"" in the North-West Territories (s. 59) and established a Legislative Assembly of
the North-West Territories (s. 13). The Act was silent as to the
language or languages of the legislature and the courts.

[Page 289]

In 1877 an amendment to The North-West
Territories Act, 1875 was adopted by Parliament (S.C. 1877, c. 7, s. 11)
which provided for certain linguistic rights in the North-West Territories. At
that time the size of the francophone population in the Territories, according
to the undisputed submissions of the Attorney General for Saskatchewan,
was almost as large as the anglophone population, numbering about 2900 and
3100, respectively. This amendment read as follows:

11. Either the English or the French language may be
used by any person in the debates of the said Council, and in the proceedings
before the Courts, and both those languages shall be used in the records and
journals of the said Council, and the ordinances of the said Council shall be
printed in both those languages.

In 1891 this section was amended
(S.C. 1891, c. 22, s. 18) to provide the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories with the authority to ""regulate its
proceedings, and the manner of recording and publishing the same"". This
amendment enabled the Legislative Assembly to abrogate the use of French in the
Legislative Assembly or in the publication of the proceedings of the Assembly,
if it so desired. The right to use either French or English ""in the
proceedings before the courts"" was not altered by this amendment.

110. Either the English or the French language may be
used by any person in the debates of the Legislative Assembly of the
Territories and in the proceedings before the courts; and both those languages
shall be used in the records and journals of such Assembly; and all ordinances
made under this Act shall be printed in both those languages: Provided,
however, that after the next general election of the Legislative Assembly, such
Assembly may, by ordinance or otherwise, regulate its proceedings, and the
manner of recording and publishing the same; and the regulations so made shall
be embodied in a proclamation which shall be forthwith made and published by
the Lieutenant Governor in conformity with the law, and thereafter shall have
full force and effect.

This section was in force in this
form at the time of the passage of the Saskatchewan Act in 1905.

[Page 290]

The addition of the local
authority proviso regarding language use in the Legislative Assembly coincided
with the influx of settlers into the western plains. The demographics of the
region changed dramatically commencing late in the century and took on the
language characteristics which have continued to this day as shall be seen
later in these reasons. To complete the story it should be noted that in
January, 1892 the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories passed a
resolution providing that its proceedings should be in the English language
only. This resolution was not proclaimed in the manner prescribed in s. 110 and
never became law.

In 1905 the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan
were created by federal statutes. The sections of the Saskatchewan Act,
mainly of concern here are:

3. The provisions of The British North America Acts,
1867 to 1886 [now the Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1886], shall apply to
the province of Saskatchewan in the same way and to the like extent as they
apply to the provinces heretofore comprised in the Dominion, as if the said
province of Saskatchewan had been one of the provinces originally united,
except in so far as varied by this Act and except such provisions as are in
terms made, or by reasonable intendment may be held to be, specially applicable
to or only to affect one or more and not the whole of the said provinces.

16. (1) All laws and all orders and regulations made
thereunder, so far as they are not inconsistent with anything contained in this
Act, or as to which this Act contains no provision intended as a substitute
therefor, and all courts of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and all
commissions, powers, authorities and functions, and all officers and
functionaries, judicial, administrative and ministerial, existing immediately
before the coming into force of this Act in the territory hereby established as
the province of Saskatchewan, shall continue in the said province as if this
Act and The Alberta Act had not been passed; subject, nevertheless,
except with respect to such as are enacted by or existing under Acts of the
Parliament of Great Britain, or of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland, to be repealed, abolished or altered by the
Parliament of Canada, or by the Legislature of the said province, according to
the authority of the Parliament or of the 

[Page 291]

said Legislature: Provided
that all powers, authorities and functions which under any law, order or
regulation were, before the coming into force of this Act, vested in or
exercisable by any public officer or functionary of the North-West Territories
shall be vested in and exercisable in and for the said province by like public
officers and functionaries of the said province when appointed by competent
authority.

Stripping the non-essential words
from s. 16(1) so as to make this complex and perhaps ungrammatical provision
understandable, s. 16(1) reads as follows: ""All laws … so far as they are
not inconsistent with anything contained in this Act, or as to which this Act
contains no provision intended as a substitute therefor, and all courts of
civil and criminal jurisdiction … existing immediately before the coming into
force of this Act in … Saskatchewan, shall continue in the said province …
subject, nevertheless … to be repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament
of Canada, or by the Legislature … according to the authority of the Parliament
or of the said Legislature…""

This general provision for the
incorporation by reference of the laws of the North-West Territories into the new province of Saskatchewan, must be read and understood in the
light of s. 14 of the Saskatchewan Act which specifically incorporated
the North-West Territories
laws constituting the Legislative Assembly of the North-West
Territories, into the laws of Saskatchewan.

14. Until the said Legislature otherwise determines, all
the provisions of the law with regard to the constitution of the Legislative
Assembly of the North-West Territories and the election of members thereof
shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the Legislative Assembly of the said
province and the election of members thereof respectively.

The Saskatchewan Act also
established a legislature in the new province:

12. There shall be a Legislature for the said province
consisting of the Lieutenant Governor and one House to be styled the
Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

[Page 292]

13. Until the said Legislature otherwise provides, the
Legislative Assembly shall be composed of twenty-five members, to be elected to
represent the electoral divisions defined in the schedule to this Act.

14. Supra.

15. The writs for the election of the members of the
first Legislative Assembly of the said province shall be issued by the
Lieutenant Governor and made returnable within six months after this Act comes
into force.

By these comprehensive provisions
the Parliament of Canada established a legislature for the new province being
carved out of the North-West Territories.
In the words of s. 16(1) of the Saskatchewan Act these provisions are
""a substitute"" for the laws of the North-West Territories relating
to the Legislative Assembly of the Territories. Consequently, the laws
incorporated into the new province by s. 16(1) do not include the laws of the
Territories dealing with the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories, including that part of s. 110 which relates to the
Legislative Assembly. The legislature, almost immediately upon its
establishment by the Saskatchewan Act and the election of its members,
proceeded to enact The Legislative Assembly Act, S.S. 1906, c. 4, under
which the organization of the legislature of the province of Saskatchewan was
completed.

This new legislature then in 1906
and 1907 abolished or replaced the courts which theretofore may have operated
transitionally in the part of the North-West
 Territories which was included in the new province of
Saskatchewan by virtue of s. 16(1) of the Saskatchewan Act. These new provincial courts were established by the
following statutes: The Magistrates Act, S.S. 1906, c. 19; The
Judicature Act, S.S. 1907, c. 8; The District Courts Act, S.S. 1907,
c. 9; The Surrogate Courts Act, S.S. 1907, c. 10; The Police
Magistrates' Act, S.S. 1907, c. 14; The King's Bench Act, S.S. 1915,
c. 10; The Court of Appeal Act, S.S. 1915, c. 9; The Provincial Court
Act, 1978, S.S. 1978, c. 42 (now R.S.S. 1978 (Supp.), c. P-30.1).

These enactments created new
courts by the exercise of powers given the province under s. 

[Page 293]

92(14) of the Constitution
Act, 1867  which were made available to the new province by s. 3 of the Saskatchewan Act. The importation of the
full panoply of provincial powers into Saskatchewan was clearly a 'substitute' for the judicature
provisions of the North-West Territories.

Furthermore s. 3 of the Saskatchewan
Act precludes the operation of s. 133  of the Constitution Act, 1867 
within the province of Saskatchewan. The new province is therefore given
full plenary powers to establish its courts and legislature as it sees fit free
from any restrictions in s. 133 . This direct and express grant of
constitutional authority cannot be subject to derogation by a facilitative,
transitional adoption of some laws of the North-West
 Territories.

With the exception of laws
relating to the new institutions of the new province, the general law of the
Territories was continued in Saskatchewan in transition until the new provincial legislature
enacted appropriate private and public law.

III. The Course of Proceedings
Herein to Date

This proceeding grew in a fashion
now all too familiar to the courts. The issue which emerged from the opening of
the trial was simply the use of the French language and French versions of
certain statutes of Saskatchewan in the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan, in a
proceeding relating to a charge under a provincial statute. The appellant at
that stage of these proceedings asked for an adjournment of the hearing until
the Clerk of the provincial legislative assembly produced for the assistance of
the appellant in the conduct of the proceedings in the Provincial Court, five
statutes printed and proclaimed in French: The Vehicles Act, R.S.S.
1978, c. V-3, The Summary Offences Procedure Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. S-63, The
Interpretation Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. I-11, The Saskatchewan Evidence Act,
R.S.S. 1978, c. S-16, and The Provincial Court Act, R.S.S. 1978 (Supp.),
c. P-30.1. From his conviction on the charge under The Vehicles Act,
Father Mercure appealed by way of a stated case. The record in these proceed-

[Page 294]

ings consists only of the stated
case and the judgments of the courts below.

This Court after granting leave
to appeal set forth (by order of this Court, dated July 7, 1986) the following
constitutional questions:

1. Does s. 110 of The North-West
Territories Act (54 & 55 Vict., c. 22, s. 18) continue to apply, in
whole or in part, to the province of Saskatchewan by virtue of s. 16 of the Saskatchewan Act?

2. If the answer to Question
1 is affirmative, do the rights which are derived from s. 110 of The North-West
Territories Act form part of the Constitution of Canada or can they be
modified unilaterally by Saskatchewan and if so to what extent?

3. If the answer to Question
1 is affirmative, does s. 110 of The North-West Territories Act require Saskatchewan
to print its laws in English and in French?

4. If the answer to Question
1 is affirmative, does s. 110 of The North-West Territories Act afford a party pleading
in a court of Saskatchewan the right to use either English or French?

5. If the answer to Question
1 is affirmative, does s. 110 of The North-West Territories Act require
that the proceedings be conducted in English or French at the option of the
accused or defendant?

6. If the answer to Question
4 is affirmative, does the right to use either English or French before the
courts of Saskatchewan include, by virtue of s. 110 of The North-West
Territories Act, the right to be understood by the judge or judge and jury
without the assistance of an interpreter or simultaneous translation?

It will be seen that a proceeding
which commenced as a quasi-criminal proceeding in a provincial court under a
provincial statute has gradually transformed itself into either an action for
declaration or an informal reference seeking the same result as though the
reference were in fact made under either provincial or federal legislation for
that purpose. It is an unhappy characteristic of this style of litigation in
the courts today that the factual record upon which the ultimate proceeding is
based is at best an inadequate foundation of 

[Page 295]

evidence or information from
which this Court must discern the ultimate issues raised by successor parties
and upon which to found a final dispositive judgment responding to these late
emerging but very important issues. The doctrine of res judicata is of
uncertain application to such proceedings.

IV. Judgments of the Lower
Courts

A. Saskatchewan Provincial
 Court

As noted, the appellant made a
preliminary application to the Court, prior to entering a plea, to be permitted
to enter a plea in French, to have his trial proceeded with in French, and to
have the hearing delayed until the Clerk of the Saskatchewan Legislative
Assembly could deliver before the court certain relevant Saskatchewan
statutes printed in French. In the view of Deshaye, Prov. Ct. J., s. 110 of The
North-West Territories Act continued to apply to the province of Saskatchewan by virtue of s. 16(1) of the Saskatchewan Act. Beginning in 1906, the
Saskatchewan Legislature began to replace the Supreme Court of the North-West
Territories with the courts of Saskatchewan. Judge Deshaye held that this did not thereby
abolish the subject-matter to which s. 16(1) makes reference. The
""courts"" referred to in s. 110 continued to exist and the language
guarantees found therein continued to apply to the new Saskatchewan
courts. Judge Deshaye held that s. 110 entitled the appellant to address the
court in French and to be provided with an interpreter. He also held that the
appellant was not entitled to be provided with statutes printed in French
because s. 110 required that only ordinances of the Legislative Assembly of the
North-West Territories
be printed in both English and French. The subject-matter of this enactment,
the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories, ceased to function in the portion of
the Territories which became the province
 of Saskatchewan. Section 110 had therefore no application to the
Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan that was established in the Saskatche-

[Page 296]

wan Act, and the appellant was not entitled to statutes
printed in French.

B. Saskatchewan Court of Appeal

Chief Justice Bayda, writing for
the majority of the Court, largely agreed with the findings of Deshaye, Prov.
Ct. J. Section 110 was incorporated into Saskatchewan by s. 16(1) and its language guarantees continued to
apply to the newly established Saskatchewan courts. Bayda C.J.S. held that s. 110 entitled the
appellant to be provided with an interpreter. As did Deshaye, Prov. Ct. J.,
Bayda C.J.S. also held that s. 110 did not apply to the Legislative Assembly of
Saskatchewan. Upon the creation of the province of Saskatchewan, no further ordinances of the
Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories
were made in relation to Saskatchewan and the provision in question ceased to have any
further effect in Saskatchewan. The appellant was not therefore entitled to
statutes printed in French.

Hall J.A. dissented in the Court
of Appeal. He held that s. 110 was applicable only to the courts of the North-West
Territories and became inapplicable in Saskatchewan once the province established courts of its own.
Further, he noted that if s. 110 had remained in force in Saskatchewan,
s. 110 would not be satisfied merely by supplying an interpreter. Simultaneous
translation would be required. He also held, without explanatory reasoning,
that the clear language of s. 110 required that the statutes of Saskatchewan
be printed in both English and French.

V. Preliminary Matters

It should be noted that the
relevant provisions of the Alberta Act, S.C. 1905, c. 3, are identical
to those of the Saskatchewan Act with respect to the incorporation of
the laws of the North-West Territories.
The Attorney General for Alberta accordingly appeared as an intervener in this appeal
and 

[Page 297]

supported the position taken by
the province of Saskatchewan.

It is important to briefly
dispose of those matters which are not properly at issue in these proceedings.
The appellant was charged with a provincial offence and not a criminal offence
as found in the Criminal Code . This appeal does not therefore raise the
issue of what 'criminal procedure' is to be employed in Saskatchewan courts
pursuant to s. 16(2) of the Saskatchewan Act which specifically provides
for the incorporation into provincial law of the rules of procedure in criminal
matters.

It should also be noted that the
trial of the appellant did not take place in the Court of Queen's Bench but in
the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan. There was no North-West Territory counterpart for such a court. Section 101  of the Constitution
Act, 1867  does not ultimately reach the court of Deshaye Prov. Ct. J.
through s. 16(1) of the Saskatchewan Act, s. 4 of the Constitution
Act, 1871, or otherwise. Furthermore, any court of comparable jurisdiction
as may have existed in the North-West Territories ceased to exist in the province of Saskatchewan at the latest upon the passage of The Magistrates
Act in 1906 and The Police Magistrates' Act in 1907, when the forerunners
of the present-day provincial courts were established in the province. The
present provincial courts were established by The Provincial Court Act, 1978
and unless the legislature of Saskatchewan is found to be constitutionally illegitimate, these
courts were validly established by the province. Section 110 of The North-West
Territories Act is left without any attachment or application to the trial
court of Judge Deshaye in which these proceedings originated.

The issue raised in question 6
has already been resolved in principle in the event that s. 110 of The North-West
Territories Act is found to apply in Saskatchewan. This Court in Sociéié des Acadiens du Nouveau-Brunswikc
Inc. v. Association of Parents for fairness in Education, [1986] 1 

[Page 298]

S.C.R. 549, held (at pp. 574-75)
that ""there is no language guarantee, either under s. 133 of the
Constitution Act, 1867, or s. 19  of
the Charter , any more than under s. 17  of the Charter , that the
speaker will be heard or understood, or that he has the right to be heard or
understood in the language of his choice"" (per Beetz J.) This
reasoning with respect to s. 133  of the Constitution Act, 1867  and s. 19 
of the Charter  is equally applicable to s. 110 of The North-West
Territories Act if it be now in effect in Saskatchewan as asserted by the
appellant.

The Legislative Assembly Act of 1906, as is the case in The Judicature Act
of 1907, and in the other court legislation of Saskatchewan, is silent as to
the language in which the legislature functions. Unless some constitutional
source for the demand for statutes printed in the French language can be found,
the burden is upon the person asserting such a right to establish it in the
laws of the province. The statute was enacted in English; the forms for use by
the public and by public officers in connection with the operations of the
legislature, and for the election of members are all in English. There is no
source for such a right asserted by anyone before this Court other than s. 110.

VI. The Relationship Between
the Saskatchewan Act
and s. 110 of The North-West
 Territories Act

The ultimate decision to be made
is simply whether or not s. 110 formed a part of the law of Saskatchewan
at the time of the commencement of these proceedings. That entails a detailed
examination of the relevant statutory provisions of Canada and Saskatchewan.
In order to put all these provisions, federal and provincial alike, into proper
perspective it is of first importance to recognize the basic distinction in law
between s. 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870 and the Constitution Act,
1871 on the one hand, and s. 110 of The North-West Territories Act
on the other hand. Section 23 provides:

23. Either the English or the French language may be
used by any person in the debates of the Houses of the Legislature, and both
those languages shall be used in 

[Page 299]

the respective Records and
Journals of those Houses; and either of those languages may be used by any
person, or in any Pleading or Process, in or issuing from any Court of Canada
established under the British North America Act, 1867, or in or from all or any
of the Courts of the Province. The Acts of the Legislature shall be printed and
published in both those languages.

The history of s. 23 and its
position in our Constitution is fully dealt with in the Reference re Manitoba
Language Rights, supra, and need not
be reviewed here. It became a constitutional provision whereunder language
rights were established in the Constitution of the newly created province of
Manitoba. It was not amendable by the Canadian Parliament or by the Legislature
of Manitoba.

Section 110 on the other hand was
only a part of the body of the law of the North-West
 Territories which may or may not have been continued, at best
transitionally and conditionally, into the province of Saskatchewan by s.
16(1) of the Saskatchewan Act.
Section 110 by its own terms was subject to repeal or revision by the local
legislature with reference to its application to that legislature. Furthermore,
s. 16(1) of the Saskatchewan Act expressly provided that any laws of the
North-West Territories incorporated by that section into the laws of
Saskatchewan were subject to 'repeal, abolition or alteration' by Parliament or
by the legislature of the new province according to their respective competences.
In all this process s. 110 was at no time included in the Constitution by the
Parliament of the United Kingdom, or by the Parliament of Canada pursuant to any
action taken by it under the Constitution Act, 1871.

The Saskatchewan Act in various terms already
set forth contemplated that the Saskatchewan Legislature in the exercise of its
constitutional powers under s. 92(14)  of the Constitution Act, 1867  and
otherwise would establish provincial institutions as would be in the interests
of the new province. Those powers clearly included the power to abolish the
Supreme Court of the North-West 

[Page 300]

Territories and to establish
courts and to prescribe the language of those courts. The scope of the
legislative authority of the new Saskatchewan Legislature established by ss. 12
et seq. of the Saskatchewan Act was likewise unfettered with
reference to the establishment of its own legislative assembly which, as we
have seen, it attended to in 1906. Therefore, the legislature established under
the Saskatchewan Act was replaced almost immediately when that
legislature enacted The Legislative Assembly Act, S.S. 1906, c. 4.

The Saskatchewan Act, s.
3, makes the provisions of the Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1886,
applicable to Saskatchewan except where such provisions are specially
applicable to or only affect some of the provinces, and except as such
provisions may be varied by the Saskatchewan Act. Section 133  of the Constitution
Act, 1867  does not by its terms apply to Saskatchewan. Section 133 
provides:

133. Either the English or the French Language may be
used by any Person in the Debates of the Houses of the Parliament of Canada and
of the Houses of the Legislature of Quebec; and both those Languages shall be
used in the respective Records and Journals of those Houses; and either of
those Languages may be used by any Person or in any Pleading or Process in or
issuing from any Court of Canada established under this Act, and in or from all
or any of the Courts of Quebec.

The Acts of the Parliament
of Canada and of the Legislature of Quebec shall be printed and published in
both those Languages.

There was no constitutional
impediment or restriction, unlike the situation resulting from the presence of
s. 23 in the Manitoba Act, 1870,
to the new province exercising its free legislative will under s. 92  of the Constitution
Act, 1867  as regards the use of language in the legislature and the courts.
Indeed, Parliament, acting under its authority to establish new provinces under
s. 2 of the Constitution Act, 1871, might well have made reference in
the Saskatchewan Act to s. 133  of the Constitution Act, 1867 , or
might have inserted a clause comparable to s. 23 of the Manitoba
Act, 1870. It did neither. It would
be unusual to find in 

[Page 301]

the light of all this, that s.
110 has by an indirect and convoluted process somehow been introduced into the
Constitution of Saskatchewan.

Section 3 of the Saskatchewan
Act frees Saskatchewan from the operation of s. 133  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 . The new legislature established in s. 12 of the Saskatchewan
Act is by s. 3  empowered to adopt its own rules of language in all its
functions and to establish courts without reference to any language rights. The
essence of the appellant's submission is that s. 16(1) of the Saskatchewan
Act indirectly repealed s. 3 of that same Act by requiring the new
legislature thereby established to operate under the regime of s. 133 . If this
submission fails, then none of the actions taken by the new legislature,
including the enactment of The Legislative Assembly Act in 1906
(establishing the Legislative Assembly of the province of Saskatchewan), can be
said to be in any way invalid. Section 3 of the Saskatchewan Act gives
the new province full plenary powers to establish its courts and legislature,
as it sees fit, free from any restrictions in s. 133 . This inevitably, in my
respectful view, blocks the possible introduction of s. 110 into the laws of
the new province. To introduce such a provision of the North-West Territories into the laws of Saskatchewan is in complete
conflict with the provisions and plan of the Saskatchewan Act which
establishes a complete substitution in the new province for the institutions
and the laws related thereto of the North-West Territories.

Unlike the treatment accorded to
the establishment of the courts and legislature of the new province, Parliament
in s. 17 of the Saskatchewan Act, when it came to educational matters,
made s. 93  of the Constitution Act, 1867  applicable to the new province
with variations as set out in s. 17 . Had this been done in connection with the
establishment of the provincial courts or the legislature, a result similar to
that reached in Manitoba might have been brought about. As it is, the
legislative 

[Page 302]

action taken by Parliament in the
Saskatchewan Act under the authorization of the Constitution Act,
1871 leaves the power of the legislature of the province of Saskatchewan untrammelled as regards the use of language in the
legislature and the courts.

The principal, and in my view only,
gate through which s. 110 can pass into the laws of the province of
Saskatchewan is s. 16(1) of the Saskatchewan Act. This then leads to the
question of the correct interpretation of s. 16  and the other provisions of the
Saskatchewan Act, and of The Judicature Act of Saskatchewan, S.S.
1907, c. 8, and the other acts of the province of Saskatchewan establishing
courts and their respective jurisdictions, as they may apply to the prosecution
under The Vehicles Act which started these proceedings.

The issue, however complex it may
become, can be simply stated. Either s. 110 was not incorporated by s. 16(1) of
the Saskatchewan Act into the laws of Saskatchewan, or it was so
incorporated. It is convenient to examine the former alternative first.

A. Section 110 Did Not Become
Part of the Laws of Saskatchewan

It is convenient to repeat
the operative words of s. 16(1): ""All laws … so far as they are not
inconsistent with anything contained in this Act, or as to which this Act
contains no provision intended as a substitute therefor, and all courts of
civil and criminal jurisdiction … existing immediately before the coming into
force of this Act in … Saskatchewan, shall continue in the said province …
subject, nevertheless … to be repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament
of Canada, or by the Legislature … according to the authority of the Parliament
or of the said Legislature … .""

In section 16(1), Parliament,
legislating exclusively with reference to the province of Saskatchewan in the
course of organizing the new province, established its courts. The
jurisprudential effect of 

[Page 303]

this action by Parliament was to
establish in Saskatchewan 'courts for the administration of justice' in the
words of s. 92(14)  of the Constitution Act, 1867  as Parliament was
authorized to do by s. 2 of the Constitution Act, 1871 in the course of
creating new provinces. Section 2 provides:

2. The Parliament of Canada may from time to time
establish new Provinces in any territories forming for the time being part of
the Dominion of Canada, but not included in any Province thereof, and may, at
the time of such establishment, make provision for the constitution and
administration of any such Province, and for the passing of laws for the peace,
order, and good government of such Province, and for its representation in the
said Parliament.

This was the root of authority in
the Constitution for s. 16(1). Section 101  of the Constitution Act, 1867 
does not authorize Parliament to establish the courts of a province as 'courts
of Canada'. The courts so established by Parliament in the new province were not
therefore established in an exercise of the federal power under s. 101  of the Constitution
Act, 1867  to establish 'courts of Canada'. In contrast the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories
(and perhaps other courts in the North-West Territories, if any existed) had
been established and organized by Parliament either under s. 4 of the Constitution
Act, 1871, or as 'courts of Canada' under s. 101  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 . Section 4 of the Constitution Act, 1871 states:

4. The Parliament of Canada may from time to time
make provision for the administration, peace, order, and good government of any
territory not for the time being included in any Province.

The status in constitutional law
of the courts of the North-West Territories
before the passage of the Saskatchewan Act need not be determined in the
disposition of this appeal, nor is it necessary to determine the constitutional
status of the courts of the North-West Territories as constituted in those Territories
after the formation of the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. It is unnecessary, therefore, to determine whether
s. 133  of the Constitution Act, 1867  has any application to courts 

[Page 304]

established in the North-West Territories. This Court considered that section in Jones v.
Attorney General of New Brunswick, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 182, where Laskin C.J.
stated at p. 193 that s. 133  applied in ""any federally established Court …
."" (See also MacDonald v. City of Montreal, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 460, per
Beetz J., at p. 495, and Société des Acadiens du Nouveau-Brunswick Inc. v.
Association of Parents for Fairness in Education, supra, per Dickson C.J.,
at p. 561.)

Simultaneously with the passage
of the Saskatchewan Act the courts of the North-West Territories expired
with reference to the territory comprised within the new province. These
courts, as they existed before the Saskatchewan Act in the North-West Territories, ceased to have an existence or jurisdiction inside
the new province of Saskatchewan. Indeed the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories was disestablished in the reduced North-West
Territories simultaneously with the creation of the province of Saskatchewan (see The North-West Territories Amendment Act,
1905, S.C. 1905, c. 27, s. 8).

The courts established in Saskatchewan
by the Parliament of Canada in the course of organizing the new province were
the judicial institutions of the North-West Territories borrowed for the purpose of organizing
the province of Saskatchewan
by the Parliament of Canada and temporarily or transitionally clothed with
jurisdiction inside the province of Saskatchewan. Whatever superficial trappings
these new courts in Saskatchewan might have borne, they were not the courts of
the North-West Territories but were newly established courts within the
province of Saskatchewan put in place by the Parliament of Canada acting under
s. 2 of the Constitution Act, 1871 to carry on a function under s.
92(14)  within that jurisdiction. All this constitutional action by the
Parliament of Canada is the explanation for the statute enacted by Parliament
and assented to on the same day as the Saskatchewan Act, namely The North-West
Territories Amendment Act, 1905. In section 8 of that statute Parliament
enacted: ""The Supreme Court

[Page 305]

of the North-West Territories is
hereby disestablished in the territories, but the Governor in Council may
appoint such number of persons as stipendiary magistrates, from time to time,
as may be deemed expedient, who shall have and exercise the powers, authorities
and functions by the said Act vested in a judge of the said court… ."" This
was housekeeping legislation undertaken under the constitutional authority of
s. 101  of the Constitution Act, 1867 , and/or s. 4 of the Constitution
Act, 1871. These amendments were consequential upon the action undertaken
by Parliament under s. 2 of the Constitution Act, 1871 when it
established provincial courts transitionally in the new province pending
provincial action under s. 92(14)  of the Constitution Act, 1867 , either
by the new Legislature of Saskatchewan established in s. 12 of the Saskatchewan
Act or by its successor. At the same time Parliament 'disestablished' the
last vestige of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories whether it had
been established under s. 101  of the Constitution Act, 1867  or s. 4 of
the Constitution Act, 1871.

Section 16(1) recognizes the
institutional characteristics of this action taken by Parliament, when the
section includes express provision for the repeal or abolition by the province
of the laws or the institutions of the North-West
 Territories, or by Parliament according to their respective
legislative competences. Section 16(2) expressly authorizes the province to
abolish the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories for all purposes:

16. (1) …

(2) The Legislature of the
province may, for all purposes affecting or extending to the said province,
abolish the Supreme Court of the North-West
 Territories … .

This was done by the province in
s. 3 of The Judicature Act of 1907:

[Page 306]

3. For all purposes affecting or extending to the
province of Saskatchewan the supreme court of the North-West Territories and
the offices both judicial and ministerial thereof as well as the jurisdiction,
powers and authority belonging or extending to the said court are hereby
abolished.

The legislature then proceeded to
establish the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan:

4. There is hereby constituted and established in and
for the province of Saskatchewan a superior court of record of original and
appellant jurisdiction as well in civil as in criminal cases which court shall
be called ""The Supreme Court of Saskatchewan"" and under such name
shall constitute one supreme court of judicature for the province.

Whether the Supreme Court of the North-West
Territories, and any other courts which may have existed in the Territories by
reason of federal action, were established under s. 101  of the Constitution
Act, 1867  or s. 4 of the Constitution Act, 1871, their character in
constitutional law, after the enactment of s. 16(1) of the Saskatchewan Act
by Parliament, is that of a provincial court established transitionally by
Canada as an exercise of sovereign authority under s. 2 of the Constitution
Act, 1871 pending constitutional action by the province under s. 92(14)  of
the Constitution Act, 1867 . Parliament, in establishing a new province
under s. 2 , is authorized to put in place at least such organization and
institutions as may be necessary for the initial operations of the new provincial
plenary entity. In so doing, Parliament may enact measures which ordinarily
would be within the provincial sphere and which thereafter are subject to
replacement or variation by the newly established provincial legislature.
Section 6 of the Constitution Act, 1871, however, stipulates ""… it
shall not be competent for the Parliament of Canada to alter the provisions of …
any …Act hereafter establishing new Provinces … ."" In that interim any North-West
Territories judicial institution now residing constitutionally within the new
province is not a court established under either s. 101  or s. 4 , nor does it
have the constitutional characterization of such a court. It is for
constitutional purposes a 'provincial court' put in place transitionally under s.
2 of the Constitution Act, 1871. This is recognized by the terms of s. 

[Page 307]

16(2) of the Saskatchewan Act
which authorizes the abolition of the Supreme Court of the North-West
Territories by the new province and is reflected in the debates of the House of
Commons at the time. It is only the status of the courts after the province has
been established with which we are here concerned and not the status of the
courts of the North-West Territories prior to the birth of the province of Saskatchewan. If section 133 is indeed found to apply to
'federally established courts' in the North-West Territories, and it is again
observed that it is unnecessary to determine that issue in order to dispose of
this appeal, that section in any case has no application to the province of
Saskatchewan. Section 3 of the Saskatchewan Act supports this conclusion
as it specifies that the ""provisions of the British North America Acts,
1867 to 1886 [now the Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1886], shall apply to
the province of Saskatchewan … except such provisions as are in terms made …
specially applicable to or only to affect one or more and not the whole of the
said provinces"". Section 133 is such a provision and thus has no
application to Saskatchewan institutions.

All this was understood and
contemplated by the Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in speaking in the
House of Commons at the time of the passage of the Saskatchewan Act and
the complementary North-West Territories Amendment Act, 1905:

It was because the courts of
law were then, as they are to-day, under the jurisdiction of this parliament,
and not under the jurisdiction of the territorial legislature; and therefore,
according to the terms of section 133 …

The courts of the Northwest Territories were established under this Act [Constitution Act, 1867 ], and
therefore the parliament of Canada had not the power to abolish the use of the French
language in those courts. When those courts shall have become provincial, we
shall no longer have jurisdiction over them, and therefore the legislature will
have the right to deal with the language in the courts as well as in the
legislature.

[Page 308]

(Debates of the House of
Commons, June 30, 1905, at p. 8579)

In an earlier statement by the
Prime Minister then quoted by him to the House of Commons, he had stated (at p.
8580):

It is impossible to admit,
for instance, that the institutions of the Northwest are permanent. On the
contrary, they are exceptionally temporary; they deal with a state of things
which is exceptional in itself; they were devised at a time when there was no
population, and they must be modified from time to time as the necessities of
the case require.

The Prime Minister then continued
(at p. 8580):

Has anything been done in
this constitution for the language of any minority in any province? Nothing at
all. The fathers of confederation did not pretend to authorize the French
language in any part of the Dominion except in this parliament and in the province of
Quebec. Everywhere else the people were left free to deal with the matter as
they thought fit.

Later in the same debate a member
of the House of Commons, Mr. Brodeur, at p. 8608, stated:

Now that the Northwest Territories are about to become provinces they have to be dealt with as all the
other provinces are. The organization of the courts falls entirely under their
control and they have the right to declare what language shall be used in the
courts, whether it shall be English or French.

It may be that s. 133  of the Constitution
Act, 1867  explains the proviso in s. 110  whereby the Legislative Assembly
of the North-West Territories may only abrogate the use of French in its
legislative proceedings and not the use of French before the courts. On the
other hand, should Parliament have been acting pursuant to its s. 4 Constitution
Act, 1871 responsibilities in establishing courts and a legislature in the North-West
Territories, the purpose of s. 110 at the time of its enactment as part of its
s. 4 responsibilities is self-evident and of specific application to the North-West
Territories' institutions. Section 110 was therefore either a precautionary
recognition of s. 133  or a part of the federal administration of those
territories lying outside any province under s. 4 of the Constitution Act,
1871. Therefore whether the constitutional base of the North-West Territo-

[Page 309]

ries courts be s. 101  or s. 4  the
result from the operation of s. 16 of the Saskatchewan Act is precisely
the same in determining the constitutional character of the courts by that
section established in the province of Saskatchewan.
As Sir Wilfrid Laurier stated, these laws relating to the North-West
Territories were very temporary and particular in application to the
Territories. Once these courts were no longer within the jurisdiction of
Parliament, neither s. 133  nor any measures adopted pursuant to s. 4 had, by
reason only of the powers granted Parliament under s. 4, any application in the
province of Saskatchewan. These constitutional considerations together with the
plain meaning of the words adopted by Parliament in s. 110 lead inexorably to
the conclusion that Parliament never intended that s. 110 of The North-West Territories Act should apply to courts
not within the federal jurisdiction.

It follows that if s. 110 was
intended to apply only to the courts of the North-West Territories, as it is
expressed to be, and to no successor courts, the provision in the same section
with regard to the printing of laws in French was to apply only to the
Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories and not to any legislature
outside the North-West Territories.

As Parliament did in the case of
courts in s. 16 , Parliament also did in ss. 12 to 15 of the Saskatchewan
Act, with reference to the legislature of the new province. Parliament
there established a legislature for the new province, the Legislative Assembly
of Saskatchewan, and until the new legislature otherwise determined, the laws
of the North-West Territories relating to the constitution and
election of members of the new legislative assembly were by the Saskatchewan
Act made applicable mutatis mutandis to the new provincial
legislature.

In the words of s. 16(1) of the Saskatchewan
Act these provisions are ""a substitute"" found in s. 16(1) itself,
for the laws of the North-West Terri-

[Page 310]

tories relating to the
Legislative Assembly of the Territories otherwise eligible for incorporation
into Saskatchewan. Consequently, the laws incorporated into the new
province by s. 16(1) do not include the laws of the Territories dealing with
the Legislative Assembly of the North-West
 Territories, including that part of s. 110 which relates to the
Legislative Assembly.

Support for this interpretation
of these statutes is found in s. 14 of the Saskatchewan Act, which
provides that the laws of the North-West Territories relating to the ""constitution""
and the ""election of members"" of the North-West Territories
Legislature shall apply to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan. If all the
laws of the North-West Territories,
including s. 110, were carried forward into Saskatchewan by virtue of s.
16(1) of the Saskatchewan Act, then s. 14 of the same Act would be
unnecessary.

This conclusion is supported by
the decision of the full Court of Appeal of the North-West Territories, when
sitting as the appellate court of the province of Saskatchewan after the
proclamation of the Saskatchewan Act, in Strachan v. Lamont
(1906), 4 W.L.R. 411. This case focussed on s. 16(1) and s. 14 of the Saskatchewan Act. The Court in Strachan
considered whether s. 14  required the application of The Controverted
Elections Ordinance of the Consolidated Ordinances of the North-West
Territories, 1898, c. 4, to the recently created Saskatchewan legislature. The
court also considered the relevance of s. 16 of the Saskatchewan Act. Wetmore J., concurring
with the majority on that point, stated the following at p. 415:

I am of opinion that the
provisions of sec, 16 of the Saskatchewan Act are not applicable to the matters
under discussion. The laws, etc., referred to in that section are laws, etc.,
with respect to subject matters that are in existence; they do not refer to
such a law as the Territories Controverted Elections Ordinance. That Ordinance
has relation to a subject matter which has been wiped out by the Saskatchewan
Act, namely, the Territorial Assembly. We must therefore have recourse to sec.
14 of the Act, and, if there is nothing in that section to make the
Controverted Elections Ordinance in force as to the election of members to the
Legislative

[Page 311]

Assembly, then there are no
other provisions in the Act that will do so.

According to Wetmore J., the
""subject matter"" of The Controverted Elections Ordinance, that
is, the Legislative Assembly of the North-West
 Territories, was ""wiped out"" by the Saskatchewan
Act which established a new Saskatchewan Legislature. As a result, given
that the laws incorporated into Saskatchewan pursuant to s. 16(1) refer only to laws ""with
respect to subject matters that are in existence"", the ordinance in
question could not be incorporated into Saskatchewan because its subject matter no longer existed.

Sifton C.J. agreed with this
analysis of Wetmore J. (at pp. 412-13). The Chief Justice then stated that s.
16  could not operate to permit the application of any of these laws pertaining
to the Assembly of the North-West Territories because ""sec. 16  was not
intended to cover any special legislation"" (p. 413). In his view
Parliament ""explicitly declared"" so by the operation of both ss. 14 
and 16(3)  (which continues the existence of all societies incorporated under
the Assembly of the North-West Territories). Sifton C.J. held that if s. 16(1)
was intended to have the effect of incorporating all ""special
legislation"" of the North-West Territories
into Saskatchewan, both ss. 14  and 16(3)  would have been unnecessary.
The Chief Justice concluded that the laws of the North-West Territories which
established the institutions of that jurisdiction had no continuing application
to the newly created institutions of the new and plenary jurisdiction of the province of Saskatchewan. All five of the judges were of this view by reason
of s. 16(1).

In the result the case stands for
the proposition that ordinances or laws of the North-West Territories specific
to the institutions of the North-West Territories,
a federal jurisdiction, have no further application to the new institutions
established in the province of Saskatchewan. Their ""subject matter""
was eliminated by the creation of the new institutions. It follows therefore
that laws specific to the Legislative Assembly of the North-West 

[Page 312]

Territories, such as s. 110 which
provides for language in the ""Legislative Assembly of the
Territories"", ceased to apply to the new Saskatchewan Legislature that was
established by s. 12 of the Saskatchewan Act. What
was said in Strachan, supra, regarding the legislature applies with
equal force to the courts established in s. 16(1).

The provinces of Saskatchewan
and Alberta have presumably relied upon Strachan since
1906 and the interpretation of these statutes therein applied should only be
set aside if it is clearly in error which in my view is far from the case. The
decision of the Court of Appeal in Strachan, has, on the contrary,
produced a reasonable result in all the circumstances surrounding the early
days of the province. The interpretations placed upon the federal and
provincial statutes relating to these events should not therefore be cast aside
at this late date.

Section 16(1) itself included two
exclusionary provisions with regard to the incorporation of legislation of the North-West Territories into the laws of the new province. Firstly, any laws
inconsistent with the Saskatchewan Act or secondly, any laws as to which
the Saskatchewan Act contains a provision as a substitute therefor, are
not carried forward into the new province by s. 16(1). There is nothing in the Saskatchewan
Act which addresses the use of language in the courts or the legislature of
the province. Therefore the exclusive provincial legislative sovereignty under
the Constitution remains untrammelled by any provisions of the Saskatchewan
Act, and indeed it is specifically protected by s. 3 of the Saskatchewan Act. Section 110 of The North-West
Territories Act, on the other hand, prescribes the use of language in the
courts and the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories. The
application of that provision would be a curtailment of the institutions
created and the authority granted to the legislature of the new province by the
Saskatchewan Act and accordingly s. 110 is in conflict and 'inconsistent'
with that Act. In the same way, s. 110 and the regime thereby described finds a
substitution for it 

[Page 313]

in s. 16(1) in the form of the
courts thereby established without any reference to language use. Similarly ss.
12 to 15 inclusive established a new legislature without any associated
language provision. These regimes are substituted for that prescribed for the North-West Territories prior to 1905 in s. 110.

Notwithstanding that none of the
constitutional questions settled by this Court make any reference to s. 14 of
the Saskatchewan Act as the conduit by which s. 110 is made a part of
the laws of Saskatchewan, it may be argued that s. 110 of The North-West
Territories Act could find its way into the laws of the province of
Saskatchewan through s. 14 . As has already been discussed, this section is a
denial of the argument in favour of a broad, all-inclusive interpretation of s.
16(1) of the same Act as a device for the incorporation of any and all laws of
the North-West Territories into the laws of the new province. This
consideration underlies the reasoning in Strachan, supra. The much
narrower issue raised by the invocation of s. 14  for these purposes is whether
or not s. 110 is a ""provision … of the law [presumably, the law of the North-West
Territories] with regard to the constitution of the Legislative Assembly of the
North-West Territories and the election of members thereof…."" We are here
concerned only with the first part of the provision relating to the
""constitution"" of the North-West Territories Legislature. Wetmore J.
in Strachan, supra, at p. 415, decided that the term
""constitution"" did not include the North-West Territories Controverted Elections Ordinance in the laws
applicable to the new provincial legislature.

Sifton C.J. approaches the
question as to the effect of s. 14  vis-à-vis the laws of the province of Saskatchewan
in this way (at p. 414):

Chapter 2 [of the
Consolidated Ordinances of the North-West Territories, 1898] deals with the
number of legislators, quorum, election of Speaker, rules for conduct, etc.,
and generally with the constitution of the Assembly, and is, by its tenor,
plainly pointed out as 

[Page 314]

being the law referred to in
the first part of sec. 14 , ""with regard to the constitution,"" etc.

Chapter 2, mentioned by the Chief
Justice, was enacted by the Legislative Assembly of the Territories in 1895. It
is entitled An Ordinance Respecting the Legislative Assembly of the
Territories. It deals with those matters referred to in the above quotation
from the judgment of the Chief Justice except ""rules for conduct"".
Unless the Chief Justice meant that the term ""rules for conduct""
referred to the taking of votes, procedure to be followed in the absence of the
Speaker and the Deputy Speaker, and how vacancies arising in the membership of
the Assembly are to be filled, it would appear that the ""rules for
conduct"" are not dealt with in Chapter 2 at all. There is no reference in
any of the provisions of the Ordinance or in the forms appended thereto to the
use of any particular language in the sessions of the Assembly. If, as the
Chief Justice says, s. 14  points to Chapter 2 of the Consolidated Ordinances of
the North-West Territories, 1898, then the content of Chapter 2 supports the
narrower interpretation placed upon ""constitution"" by the
Saskatchewan court. The incorporation of this Ordinance into the laws of Saskatchewan
would not, in my opinion, contribute anything to the submissions made by the
appellant herein stipulating or authorizing the use of the French language in
the proceedings of the Legislative Assembly.

Sifton C.J. continued (at p.
414):

It was strongly urged upon
the argument of this case that the word ""constitution"" in sec. 14  had
a much broader meaning than this, and should be taken to mean that all laws in
any way affecting the Legislative Assembly or its constituent parts were
intended, but the wording of sec. 14  itself shews, to my mind, conclusively,
that no such meaning can properly be given to the word as there used …

Taking into account the laws of
the Territories applicable to the Legislative Assembly and given the words
employed by Parliament in s. 14 , it is difficult to read into the word
""constitution"" of the Assembly any meaning other than ""what
constitutes the Assembly"". Section 14  would not appear 

[Page 315]

to make any contribution to the
search for the establishment of language rights in the Saskatchewan
courts.

It is perhaps equally telling
that s. 110, dealing as it does with the use of language in the Legislative
Assembly and the courts, is more properly classified as a procedural element.
This would cause s. 110 to fall well short of a provision which might come
within what could be called ""the constitution of the Legislative
Assembly"". By any line of reasoning it is difficult, with all respect to
those who may hold views to the contrary, to interpret s. 14  as somehow
reaching out and pulling s. 110 of the federal North-West Territories Act
into the laws of the province of Saskatchewan
relating to the newly established legislature and judicial institutions of the
new province.

The province of
Saskatchewan, like all provinces, was granted the power to establish its own
courts and provide for the administration of these courts under s. 92(14)  of
the Constitution Act, 1867 , including any language rights in those
courts. The exercise of this power by the province was specifically
contemplated in s. 16(2) of the Saskatchewan Act which anticipated that
the new province would abolish the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories. Section 110 of The North-West Territories Act
cannot reasonably be read so as to have the effect of altering by inference
this constitutional division of powers provided for in both the Constitution
Act, 1867  and the Saskatchewan Act from the very beginning of the
province. Nor could it have such effect in law.

An enactment intended to have
constitutional impact must clearly express such an intent. As was decided by
this Court in Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick, supra, at p. 197, ""in
the absence of federal legislation competently dealing with the language of
proceedings or matters before provincial Courts which fall within exclusive
federal legislative authority"", the province may ""… legislate
respecting the languages in which proceedings in Courts established by that
Legislature 

[Page 316]

might be conducted"".
Language in the Saskatchewan provincial courts with the exception of matters
falling within exclusive federal jurisdiction is thus a matter to be determined
by the province of Saskatchewan.
It would be remarkable to see such an important matter left to inference and
obscure reference. In the result, I conclude that s. 110 was not incorporated
into the laws of the province of Saskatchewan and accordingly was not in effect at
the time of the commencement of these proceedings in the Provincial Court of
Saskatchewan.

This conclusion is sufficient to
dispose of this appeal in my view. However, an alternative route to the same
result is available even if the correct view of the law is that s. 110 was
incorporated into the laws of the province
 of Saskatchewan by s. 16(1). Because this alternative was advanced
and argued before this Court, it should be briefly examined.

B. Alternatively, Section 110
Was Made Part of the Laws of Saskatchewan

Even assuming s. 110 is part of
the provincial laws, there are interpretative difficulties in the path of the
appellant on this leg of the argument in applying it to the Legislature and the
courts of Saskatchewan because of the language used by Parliament in s. 110
itself. The section given its plain meaning can apply only to the
""Legislative Assembly of the Territories"". The reference to the
""courts"" is equally clear. The failure of the federal legislature to
repeat the obvious by inserting ""of the Territories"" after the word
""courts"" does not weaken the section as a clear expression of
legislative intent to apply the regulation to the courts of the North-West
Territories. Saskatchewan was not, at the time of the enactment of s. 110, in
existence. Even if it had been it could hardly be urged that a statute entitled
The North-West Territories Act could
be taken to have been intended for the regulation of an additional
jurisdiction.

[Page 317]

As we have already seen, s. 110,
if it came into Saskatchewan law at all, it did so instantaneously with the
termination of the existence of the only two institutions to which s. 110
applies. Thus section 110 became spent as regards the legislature and the
courts of Saskatchewan simultaneously with its introduction into Saskatchewan
law. If section 110 were a part of Saskatchewan law at that time, it became nugatory, almost 75
years before these proceedings began. As discussed below, s. 110 was repealed
by Parliament in 1907 (S.C. 1907, c. 43) and was never reenacted with reference
to the Territories nor effective within the new province by any reenactment by
Parliament (Constitution Act, 1871, s. 6). Indeed the Legislative
Assembly of the Territories was either abolished or eclipsed by powers granted
in s. 6 of The North-West Territories Amendment Act, 1905 where it was
provided:

6. The Commissioner in Council shall have the same
powers to make ordinances for the government of the Territories as are by the
said Act vested in the Legislative Assembly of the territories in relation to
such subjects heretofore within the legislative authority of the said Assembly
as are from time to time designated by the Governor in Council.

The legislative records of the North-West
Territories do not reveal that the Legislative Assembly functioned thereafter.
The next recorded ordinances were enacted by the Commissioner in Council
commencing in 1922 (see the Ordinances of the Northwest Territories,
1905-1930). A practical difficulty arose with reference to any continuation of
the North-West Territories Legislative Assembly. Its constituencies, 35 in all,
were substantially replaced by the 50 constituencies created in the Saskatchewan
and Alberta Acts in 1905. There may have been some surviving constituencies not
reassigned or redesigned in 1905 with reference to that part of the province of Manitoba carved out of the North-West Territories in 1912
whereby the small rectangular province
 of Manitoba was expanded so as to have the same northern
boundary as the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. (See The Manitoba Boundaries
Extension Act, 1912, S.C. 1912, c.

[Page 318]

32.) By that time there may have
been no surviving constituencies for the election of any members of the
Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories. Thus for all practical purposes, even
if it had been reenacted with reference to the Territories, s. 110 would have
been without function or application.

In summary, even if the
incorporation of s. 110 resulted from s. 16(1) of the Saskatchewan Act,
its provisions cannot reasonably be interpreted as an intention by Parliament
to alter the basic provincial constitutional jurisdiction in this area. The province of Saskatchewan acquired the power to establish its institutions
when it was created. It subsequently exercised this power when it established
its own courts and completed the organization of its legislature in 1906 after
the establishment of the legislature by Parliament.

We are left in the case of the
Legislative Assembly with only the question of the proper application of the
rules of statutory interpretation to s. 110 and to the applicable provisions of
the Saskatchewan Act and the domestic legislation by the Legislature of
Saskatchewan. As already discussed, the Saskatchewan Legislature in 1906
established the Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly (S.S. 1906, c. 4). This is a
new legislature, a successor to that established in ss. 12 et seq. of
the Saskatchewan Act. The
1906 province of Saskatchewan statute is a self-contained
enactment fully providing for the establishment and operation of the provincial
Legislature. Upon a proper application of the canons of construction of public
statutes it is clear, in my respectful view, that even if s. 110 be found to
have been incorporated into the laws of Saskatchewan it has no application to the proceedings in the new
Legislature or the new courts of Saskatchewan. Accordingly, the appellant was not entitled to call
upon the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly to produce the five statutes in
question in the French language, or to call upon the court to conduct the trial
of the charge under the provincial statute in the French language.

[Page 319]

Support for this conclusion can
be found in the decision of Greschuk J. in R. v. Lefebvre (1982), 21
Alta. L.R. (2d) 65 (Q.B.), recently upheld by the Alberta Court of Appeal in
(1986), 48 Alta. L.R. (2d) 124. Greschuk J. at trial concluded at pp. 79-80:

In my opinion, once the
province abolished or replaced the courts of the Territories and established or
constituted its own provincial courts, s. 110 became inapplicable to the new
provincial courts. The relevant portion of s. 110 states:

""Either the English or
the French language may be used by any person in the debates of the Legislative
Assembly of the Territories and in the proceedings before the courts; and both
those languages shall be used in the records and journals of such Assembly; and
all ordinances made under this Act shall be printed in both those languages …""
I submit that the drafter of that section could have added the words ""of
the Territories"" after the words ""in proceedings before the
Courts"", but these words would have been redundant. However, there can be
no doubt also that Parliament by necessary intendment or by reasonable
inference or implication meant that either the English or the French language
may be used in proceedings before the courts ""of the Territories"".
Section 110 therefore could only refer to the courts of the Territories. And so
it follows that, since the courts of the Territories were continued in the
province, and these courts were abolished or replaced by new provincial courts
by such Acts as the Supreme Court Act, 1907; the District Courts Act; the
Police Magistrates and Justices of the Peace Act, 1906 and the Provincial Court
Act in 1971, s. 110 of the North-West Territories Act is no longer in force or
effect in Alberta. Section 110 could no longer be applicable to the new
provincial courts as provincial courts were no longer courts of the
Territories.

The judgment of Prowse J.A. for
the majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal affirms the finding of Greschuk J.
(at p. 131):

The life of s. 110 depended
upon the continuance of the courts of the North-West
 Territories. When the transition period in relation to the
courts of the North-West Territories came to an end with the enactments by the
province setting up its own courts, s. 110 ceased to have any application in
the province.

[Page 320]

With the passing of the Acts
setting up ""the Alberta courts"", the province occupied its field of
power in relation to courts …. Section 110 was not enacted for the purpose of
extending language rights into the Alberta courts after the courts of the North-West Territories ceased to have any jurisdiction in the province upon
being superseded by the Supreme Court of Alberta.

Neither the trial judge nor the Court
of Appeal found the courts of the North-West Territories, as continued by the Alberta Act
in the province of Alberta,
thereby ceased to be 'courts of Canada' so as to become 'Alberta courts'. Both of the
lower courts found that s. 110 was carried into the laws of Alberta and
continued to apply to the North-West Territory courts temporarily continued in the
province by the Alberta Act until the Alberta statutes established the
Alberta courts which then displaced the North-West
 Territory courts and s. 110. At that stage s. 110 ceased to operate as a part of Alberta laws.
With respect, I find the characterization in law of the North-West
Territories courts put in place in Saskatchewan and Alberta by Parliament pursuant to s. 2 of the Constitution
Act, 1871, to be courts of Saskatchewan and Alberta under the Constitution Act, 1867 . As a
practical matter, the same result is reached by either approach within a year
and a half of the formation of the two provinces. Belzil J.A., in dissent,
alone expressed the contrary view which has not been followed in any of the
courts in Alberta or Saskatchewan at least with reference to civil jurisdiction and
jurisdiction with respect to provincial offences.

By either line of reasoning the
effect of s. 110 in law after the adoption of the Saskatchewan Act is
the same. It is clear that the new legislature of the province has sole plenary
power under s. 92  of the Constitution Act, 1867  to establish its
legislature as it may wish (subject to limitations not here relevant) and to
specify the language or languages to be employed in its proceedings. Section
92(14)  of the Constitution Act, 1867  likewise authorizes 

[Page 321]

the new provincial legislature to
establish its own courts as it did and to specify the language to be employed
therein, again subject to exceptions not here relevant.

In the result, even if s. 110 is
found to have been incorporated into the laws of the province by way of s.
16(1), the terms of s. 110 have long before the commencement of these
proceedings become spent and inapplicable to any existing provincial
institution, legislative or judicial.

VII. Factual Circumstances
Surrounding the Establishment of the Province of Saskatchewan

Since writing these reasons for
judgment I have had the opportunity of reading those of my colleague, La Forest
J., who makes reference to historical material. The record before the Court
does not include these historical opinions and comments. The courts, and
particularly those at the second level of appeal, are neither qualified nor
authorized to conduct a trial of historical issues. Texts and essays on local
history do not always agree. Some will be factual, some speculative and even
designedly controversial. There is rarely unanimity. Migratory history and
demographic material concerning these frontier times are in my view, even if
properly admissible at this stage, seldom precise. Without the admission of
this material through the conventional processes of justice the reliability of
such material is not demonstrated. Accordingly, I seek to confine my reasons to
the record and to government census statistics and Hansard as introduced
or adverted to by counsel for the several parties.

Legislative history, on the other
hand, is of interest to courts in these circumstances although it may not by
itself be determinative of the inter-

[Page 322]

pretative issues. (See generally
Peter W. Hogg, Constitutional Law of Canada (2nd ed. 1985), at pp. 342-44,
on the use of legislative history.) Because the parties before this Court
argued the legislative history at length, it may not be inappropriate to
comment upon it. Indeed it clearly supports the conclusion I have reached in
this appeal. The creation of the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan
by Parliament gave rise to debates in the House of Commons on the issue of
language rights in the new provinces. A motion calling for the acceptance of
French as an official language in the new provinces was introduced. This motion
would have reproduced s. 110 in the body of the Saskatchewan Act itself which
would have had the effect of placing these language guarantees beyond the
competence of the province to affect or alter. This may have placed the new
provinces in exactly the same situation as Manitoba, which is subject to
certain language guarantees by virtue of s. 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870
and the Constitution Act, 1871 (see Attorney General of Manitoba v.
Forest, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 1032, and Reference re Manitoba Language Rights,
supra).

The parties before this Court
presented various excerpts from Hansard, Debates of the House of Commons.
In the debates in the House of Commons on June 30, 1905, Sir Wilfrid Laurier
strongly opposed this amendment which ""would crystallize the use of the
French language in the Provinces …."" The language question in the new
provinces was a ""subject to be dealt with by them [the provinces] as they
may see fit in the best interests of the public"" (pp. 8571-72). Sir
Wilfrid Laurier noted that the historic compromise or ""compact"" that
gave rise to s. 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870
does not apply to Saskatchewan or Alberta (p. 8576). Sir Wilfrid Laurier's government thus
defeated the motion of F. W. Monk and there was no provision placed in the Alberta
Act or the Saskatchewan Act which addressed the issue of language.
It was clearly contemplated that the 

[Page 323]

new provinces would be free to
address this issue as they saw fit.

While it may not be of
controlling influence, it certainly is supportive of the foregoing line of
reasoning that the interpretation applied to the statutes here relevant appears
to accord with the demographic facts of the province both at the time of its
formation in 1905 and continuing down to this day. In sections 18 and 20 of the
Saskatchewan Act, Parliament estimated the population of the province at the
time of its establishment in 1905 at 250,000. According to the decennial census
taken throughout this period, a huge wave of settlement took place in Saskatchewan
or the territory which became the province
 of Saskatchewan between 1901 and 1911.

(Census of Canada 1911, Statistics Canada)

Census information for the two
years 1901 and 1911 reveals that persons claiming a French 'origin' represented
in the years 1901, 2,634 persons (2.9 percent) and 1911, 23,251 persons (4.7
per cent) of the total population. (See Canada Year Book 1912, at p.
25.) To place the population development in perspective, the Canada Year
Book 1988, at pp. 2-20, reports the total population of the province in
1986 at 1,009,610 people of which, now using the classification of ""mother
tongue"", 20,725 persons (2.1 percent), were classified as French. The
basis for these population figures in the years 1901, 1911 and 1986 do not
reveal precisely the makeup of the population on the basis of first language or
language competence. These figures at the most form an approximate picture of
the demographic background of the population of the region at the times shown.
At the most it provides a source against which the legislative history of the
area can be better understood.

[Page 324]

The above population changes shed
some light on the action taken by the several legislative bodies concerned in
adding the proviso to s. 110 in 1891, in omitting from the Saskatchewan Act
anything of the nature of s. 23 in the Manitoba Act, 1870, and in
omitting any reference to language rights in The Judicature Act of 1907,
and the other court statutes of Saskatchewan.

VIII. Repeal of s. 110 by
Parliament

Some parties presented a
submission to this Court to the effect that the repeal of s. 110 of The North-West
Territories Act in January 1907 (S.C. 1907, c. 43) by Parliament somehow
settled the issue of the applicability of s. 110 in the laws of the new
province. In my view this action by Parliament and the purported re-enactment
of s. 110 in April 1907 (S.C. 1907, c. 44) adds nothing to the settlement of
the issue raised in this appeal concerning the application of s. 110 to the
institutions of Saskatchewan. If section 110 was in law incorporated by the Saskatchewan
Act into the laws of Saskatchewan, its subsequent repeal by the Parliament
of Canada would not operate so as to remove s. 110 from the body of laws of Saskatchewan.
If Parliament has indeed reinstated s. 110 as to its application in the province of
Saskatchewan, such federal legislation would have no effect on Saskatchewan.
This may be the explanation for the fact that s. 110 never reappeared in the
Statutes of Canada or the Revised Statutes of Canada after the proclamation of
c. 43 of the 1907 Statutes of Canada. The issue of the survival of s. 110 in
the laws of the province of Saskatchewan remains untouched by all this parliamentary
activity.

IX. Conclusion

By reason of the form of this
litigation as finally evolved, and in the absence of a cross-appeal, the
conventional dispositions of allowing or dismissing the appeal are
inappropriate. In any case, a new trial is out of the question, there being no
accused surviving. I therefore believe the appropriate and adequate disposition
of these proceedings is a 

[Page 325]

response to the questions put by
the Court. I would answer those questions as follows:

Question 1. No.

Questions 2 to 5 inclusive
need not, in view of my negative answer to Question 1, be answered.

Question 6 requires no answer
in these proceedings.

I am assisted in reaching this
result by the realization that in order to reach the opposite result one must
find a substitute in the applicable Saskatchewan and Alberta
legislation and that of the Parliament of Canada or the United Kingdom
Parliament relating to these new provinces, for s. 23 as it appears in the Manitoba
Act, 1870. Neither the Parliament of
Canada nor the Parliament of the United
 Kingdom saw fit to enact that section
or anything approaching it in the legislation leading up to the formation of
these new provinces. Even with s. 23 present in the Manitoba
legislation a reference, with supporting material and the involvement of both
levels of government, was necessary to bring about a constitutional resolution
of the question. There is no historical or other material produced in this
record by public authority. The Government of Canada did not participate in the
proceedings. On a very limited factual base and an equally meagre statutory
base, and without any constitutional provision clearly relating to the question
now raised, it is highly unsatisfactory to stretch the legislation relating to
the North-West Territories into a constitutional provision fundamentally
affecting the organization of these provinces. Neither the statutes reviewed in
these reasons, nor the factual situation revealed in the parliamentary debate
at that time, support the elevation to a position of an entrenched right in the
nature of a constitutional right that which was by its own terms only applicable
to the courts and Legislature of the North-West Territories, and in any event
was only a statutory direction subject to repeal or variation as to the
legislature by the subject legislature itself. Only by a strained
interpretation of the statute establishing Saskatchewan, and by failing to
accord to the organizational statutes of the new province their ordinary
legisla-

[Page 326]

tive impact, can s. 110 be
elevated to a constitutional provision. This would produce a result neither
intended by the Government of Canada of the day, nor expressly mentioned in any
parliamentary or legislative action at the time the province was formed.

There should, in my view, be no
order as to costs.

law ‑‑ Sexual assault ‑‑ Similar fact evidence ‑‑
Respondent charged with sexual assault on a minor ‑‑ Evidence
coming from children other than complainant ‑‑ Whether such
evidence admissible.

 

                   Held (Estey and Lamer
JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per McIntyre, La
Forest and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ.: The similar fact evidence was admissible
to show a system adopted by respondent. Its probative force was sufficient to
outweigh any prejudicial effect on respondent.

 

                   Per Estey and Lamer

of Appeal that when applied to the fact of this case the evidence was
inadmissible.

3.                       McIntyre J.‑‑The
respondent in this appeal was convicted at trial of sexual assault upon a young
girl. His appeal to the Manitoba Court of Appeal (Monnin C.J.M., Philp and
Twaddle JJ.A.) was allowed, Monnin C.J.M. dissenting: (1986), 42 Man. R. (2d)
81. The only issue argued before us concerned the admission at trial of similar
fact evidence, which came from children other than the complainant concerning
the respondent's behaviour with them. This evidence was admissible to show a
system adopted by the respondent, and its probative force was sufficient to
outweigh any prejudicial effect upon the respondent. In my opinion, no error
was made by the trial judge in its admission and I would allow the appeal and
restore the conviction.

were acquittals at trial on the principal offence of discharging a firearm with
intent to avoid arrest. The acquittals were overturned on appeal and a new
trial ordered: (1985), 62 N.B.R. (2d) 91, 161 A.P.R. 91. The Court of Appeal
found error in the directions, relating to included offences, which were given
to the jury by the trial judge. Assuming without deciding that such error
existed, we are nevertheless of the view that in light of the uncertainty
concerning the rights and powers of the Forest Service officers at the time ‑
a matter which was not canvassed in the Court of Appeal ‑ and in light
also of the fact that a period in excess of five years has elapsed since the
events giving rise to the charge occurred, the interests of justice will be
best served by allowing the appeal and restoring the acquittals.

page 31

Whether or not impugned legislation reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.
     Criminal law -- Juries -- Address to jury advising them to ignore law as stated by judge -- Counsel wrong.
     Appellants, all duly qualified medical practitioners, set up a clinic to perform abortions upon women who had not obtained a certificate from a therapeutic abortion committee of an accredited or approved hospital as required by s. 251(4)  of the Criminal Code . The doctors had made public statements questioning the wisdom of the abortion laws in Canada and asserting that a woman has an unfettered right to choose whether or not an abortion is appropriate in her individual circumstances. Indictments were preferred against the appellants charging that they had conspired with each other with intent to procure abortions contrary to ss. 423(1) (d) and 251(1)  of the Criminal Code .
     Counsel for the appellants moved to quash the indictment or to stay the proceedings before pleas were entered on the grounds that s. 251  of the Criminal Code  was ultra vires the Parliament of Canada, in that it infringed ss. 2 (a), 7  and 12  of the Charter , and was inconsistent with s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. The trial judge dismissed the motion, and the Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from that decision. The trial proceeded before a judge sitting with a jury, and the three accused were acquitted. The Crown appealed the acquittal and the appellants filed a cross-appeal. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial. The Court held that the cross-appeal related to issues already raised in the appeal, and the issues, therefore, were examined as part of the appeal.
     The Court stated the following constitutional questions:

1. Does section 251 of the Criminal Code  of Canada infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by ss. 2 (a), 7 , 12 , 15 , 27  and 28  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?
     2. If section 251 of the Criminal Code  of Canada infringes or denies the rights and freedoms guaranteed by ss. 2 (a), 7 , 12 , 15 , 27  and 28  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , is s. 251  justified by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?


page 32


     3. Is section 251 of the Criminal Code  of Canada ultra vires the Parliament of Canada?
     4. Does section 251 of the Criminal Code  of Canada violate s. 96  of the Constitution Act, 1867 ?
     5. Does section 251 of the Criminal Code  of Canada unlawfully delegate federal criminal power to provincial Ministers of Health or Therapeutic Abortion Committees, and in doing so, has the Federal Government abdicated its authority in this area?
     6. Do sections 605 and 610(3) of the Criminal Code  of Canada infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by ss. 7 , 11 (d), 11 (f), 11 (h) and 24(1)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?
     7. If sections 605 and 610(3) of the Criminal Code  of Canada infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by ss. 7 , 11 (d) 11(f), 11(h) and 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , are ss. 605  and 610(3)  justified by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?
     Held (McIntyre and La Forest JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the acquittals restored. The first constitutional question should be answered in the affirmative as regards s. 7  and the second in the negative as regards s. 7 . The third, fourth and fifth constitutional questions should be answered in the negative. The sixth constitutional question should be answered in the negative with respect to s. 605  of the Criminal Code  and should not be answered as regards s. 610(3) . The seventh constitutional question should not be answered.
     Per Dickson C.J. and Lamer J.: Section 7  of the Charter  requires that the courts review the substance of legislation once the legislation has been determined to infringe an individual's right to ""life, liberty and security of the person"". Those interests may only be impaired if the principles of fundamental justice are respected. It was sufficient here to investigate whether or not the impugned legislative provisions met the procedural standards of fundamental justice and the Court accordingly did not need to tread the fine line between substantive review and the adjudication of public policy.
     State interference with bodily integrity and serious state-imposed psychological stress, at least in the criminal law context, constitutes a breach of security of the person. Section 251 clearly interferes with a woman's physical and bodily integrity. Forcing a woman, by threat of criminal sanction, to carry a foetus to term unless she meets certain criteria unrelated to her own priorities and aspirations, is a profound interference  


page 33

with a woman's body and thus an infringement of security of the person. A second breach of the right to security of the person occurs independently as a result of the delay in obtaining therapeutic abortions caused by the mandatory procedures of s. 251 which results in a higher probability of complications and greater risk. The harm to the psychological integrity of women seeking abortions was also clearly established.
     Any infringement of the right to life, liberty and security of the person must comport with the principles of fundamental justice. These principles are to be found in the basic tenets of our legal system. One of the basic tenets of our system of criminal justice is that when Parliament creates a defence to a criminal charge, the defence should not be illusory or so difficult to attain as to be practically illusory.
     The procedure and restrictions stipulated in s. 251 for access to therapeutic abortions make the defence illusory resulting in a failure to comply with the principles of fundamental justice. A therapeutic abortion may be approved by a ""therapeutic abortion committee"" of an ""accredited or approved hospital"". The requirement of s. 251(4)  that at least four physicians be available at that hospital to authorize and to perform an abortion in practice makes abortions unavailable in many hospitals. The restrictions attaching to the term ""accredited"" automatically disqualifies many Canadian hospitals from undertaking therapeutic abortions. The provincial approval of a hospital for the purpose of performing therapeutic abortions further restricts the number of hospitals offering this procedure. Even if a hospital is eligible to create a therapeutic abortion committee, there is no requirement in s. 251 that the hospital need do so. Provincial regulation as well can heavily restrict or even deny the practical availability of the exculpatory provisions of s. 251(4) .
     The administrative system established in s. 251(4)  fails to provide an adequate standard for therapeutic abortion committees which must determine when a therapeutic abortion should, as a matter of law, be granted. The word ""health"" is vague and no adequate guidelines have been established for therapeutic abortion committees. It is typically impossible for women to know in advance what standard of health will be applied by any given committee.
     The argument that women facing difficulties in obtaining abortions at home can simply travel elsewhere would not be especially troubling if those difficulties  


page 34

were not in large measure created by the procedural requirements of s. 251. The evidence established convincingly that it is the law itself which in many ways prevents access to local therapeutic abortion facilities.
     Section 251 cannot be saved under s. 1  of the Charter . The objective of s. 251  as a whole, namely to balance the competing interests identified by Parliament, is sufficiently important to pass the first stage of the s. 1  inquiry. The means chosen to advance its legislative objectives, however, are not reasonable or demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. None of the three elements for assessing the proportionality of means to ends is met. Firstly, the procedures and administrative structures created by s. 251  are often unfair and arbitrary. Moreover, these procedures impair s. 7  rights far more than is necessary because they hold out an illusory defence to many women who would prima facie qualify under the exculpatory provisions of s. 251(4) . Finally, the effects of the limitation upon the s. 7  rights of many pregnant women are out of proportion to the objective sought to be achieved and may actually defeat the objective of protecting the life and health of women.
     Per Beetz and Estey JJ.: Before the advent of the Charter , Parliament recognized, in adopting s. 251(4)  of the Criminal Code , that the interest in the life or health of the pregnant woman takes precedence over the interest in prohibiting abortions, including the interest of the state in the protection of the foetus, when ""the continuation of the pregnancy of such female person would or would be likely to endanger her life or health"". This standard in s. 251(4)  became entrenched at least as a minimum when the ""right to life, liberty and security of the person"" was enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  at s. 7 .
     ""Security of the person"" within the meaning of s. 7  of the Charter  must include a right of access to medical treatment for a condition representing a danger to life or health without fear of criminal sanction. If an act of Parliament forces a pregnant woman whose life or health is in danger to choose between, on the one hand, the commission of a crime to obtain effective and timely medical treatment and, on the other hand, inadequate treatment or no treatment at all, her right to security of the person has been violated.


page 35


     According to the evidence, the procedural requirements of s. 251  of the Criminal Code  significantly delay pregnant women's access to medical treatment resulting in an additional danger to their health, thereby depriving them of their right to security of the person. This deprivation does not accord with the principles of fundamental justice. While Parliament is justified in requiring a reliable, independent and medically sound opinion as to the ""life or health"" of the pregnant woman in order to protect the state interest in the foetus, and while any such statutory mechanism will inevitably result in some delay, certain of the procedural requirements of s. 251  of the Criminal Code  are nevertheless manifestly unfair. These requirements are manifestly unfair in that they are unnecessary in respect of Parliament's objectives in establishing the administrative structure and in that they result in additional risks to the health of pregnant women.
     The following statutory requirements contribute to the manifest unfairness of the administrative structure imposed by the Criminal Code : (1) the requirement that all therapeutic abortions must take place in an ""accredited"" or ""approved"" hospital as defined in s. 251(6) ; (2) the requirement that the committee come from the accredited or approved hospital in which the abortion is to be performed; (3) the provision that allows hospital boards to increase the number of members of a committee; (4) the requirement that all physicians who practise lawful therapeutic abortions be excluded from the committees.
     The primary objective of s. 251  of the Criminal Code  is the protection of the foetus. The protection of the life and health of the pregnant woman is an ancillary objective. The primary objective does relate to concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society and which, pursuant to s. 1  of the Charter , justify reasonable limits to be put on a woman's right. However, the means chosen in s. 251  are not reasonable and demonstrably justified. The rules unnecessary in respect of the primary and ancillary objectives which they are designed to serve, such as the above-mentioned rules contained in s. 251 , cannot be said to be rationally connected to these objectives under s. 1  of the Charter . Consequently, s. 251 does not constitute a reasonable limit to the security of the person.
     It is not necessary to answer the question concerning the circumstances in which there is a proportionality between the effects of s. 251 which limit the right of pregnant women to security of the person and the  


page 36

objective of the protection of the foetus. In any event, the objective of protecting the foetus would not justify the severity of the breach of pregnant women's right to security of the person which would result if the exculpatory provision of s. 251 was completely removed from the Criminal Code . However, it is possible that a future enactment by Parliament that would require a higher degree of danger to health in the latter months of pregnancy, as opposed to the early months, for an abortion to be lawful, could achieve a proportionality which would be acceptable under s. 1  of the Charter .
     Given the conclusion that s. 251 contains rules unnecessary to the protection of the foetus, the question as to whether a foetus is included in the word ""everyone"" in s. 7 , so as to have a right to ""life, liberty and security of the person"" under the Charter , need not be decided.
     Section 251 is not colourable provincial legislation in relation to health but rather a proper exercise of Parliament's criminal law power pursuant to s. 91(27)  of the Constitution Act, 1867 . The section does not offend s. 96  of the Constitution Act, 1867  because the therapeutic abortion committees are not given judicial powers which were exercised by county, district and superior courts at the time of Confederation. These committees exercise a medical judgment on a medical question. Finally, s. 251 does not constitute an unlawful delegation of federal legislative power nor does it represent an abdication of the criminal law power by Parliament.
     There is no merit in the argument based on s. 605(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . It is unnecessary to decide whether or not s. 610(3)  of the Criminal Code  violates ss. 7 , 11 (d), (f), (h) and 15  of the Charter  or whether this Court has the power to award costs on appeals under s. 24(1)  of the Charter . Whatever this Court's power to award costs in appeals such as this one, costs should not be awarded in this case.
     Per Wilson J.: Section 251  of the Criminal Code , which limits the pregnant woman's access to abortion, violates her right to life, liberty and security of the person within the meaning of s. 7  of the Charter  in a way which does not accord with the principles of fundamental justice.
     The right to ""liberty"" contained in s. 7  guarantees to every individual a degree of personal autonomy over important decisions intimately affecting his or her  


page 37

private life. Liberty in a free and democratic society does not require the state to approve such decisions but it does require the state to respect them.
     A woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy falls within this class of protected decisions. It is one that will have profound psychological, economic and social consequences for her. It is a decision that deeply reflects the way the woman thinks about herself and her relationship to others and to society at large. It is not just a medical decision; it is a profound social and ethical one as well.
     Section 251  of the Criminal Code  takes a personal and private decision away from the woman and gives it to a committee which bases its decision on ""criteria entirely unrelated to [the pregnant woman's] own priorities and aspirations"".
     Section 251  also deprives a pregnant woman of her right to security of the person under s. 7  of the Charter . This right protects both the physical and psychological integrity of the individual. Section 251  is more deeply flawed than just subjecting women to considerable emotional stress and unnecessary physical risk. It asserts that the woman's capacity to reproduce is to be subject, not to her own control, but to that of the state. This is a direct interference with the woman's physical ""person"".
     This violation of s. 7  does not accord with either procedural fairness or with the fundamental rights and freedoms laid down elsewhere in the Charter . A deprivation of the s. 7  right which has the effect of infringing a right guaranteed elsewhere in the Charter  cannot be in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.
     The deprivation of the s. 7  right in this case offends freedom of conscience guaranteed in s. 2 (a) of the Charter . The decision whether or not to terminate a pregnancy is essentially a moral decision and in a free and democratic society the conscience of the individual must be paramount to that of the state. Indeed, s. 2(a) makes it clear that this freedom belongs to each of us individually. ""Freedom of conscience and religion"" should be broadly construed to extend to conscien- tiously-held beliefs, whether grounded in religion or in a secular morality and the terms ""conscience"" and ""religion"" should not be treated as tautologous if capable of independent, although related, meaning. The state here is endorsing one conscientiously-held view at the expense of another. It is denying freedom of conscience to some, treating them as means to an end, depriving them of their ""essential humanity"".

     The primary objective of the impugned legislation is the protection of the foetus. This is a perfectly valid legislative objective. It has other ancillary objectives, such as the protection of the life and health of the pregnant woman and the maintenance of proper medical standards.
     The situation respecting a woman's right to control her own person becomes more complex when she becomes pregnant, and some statutory control may be appropriate. Section 1  of the Charter  authorizes reasonable limits to be put upon the woman's right having regard to the fact of the developing foetus within her body.
     The value to be placed on the foetus as potential life is directly related to the stage of its development during gestation. The undeveloped foetus starts out as a newly fertilized ovum; the fully developed foetus emerges ultimately as an infant. A developmental progression takes place between these two extremes and it has a direct bearing on the value of the foetus as potential life. Accordingly, the foetus should be viewed in differential and developmental terms. This view of the foetus supports a permissive approach to abortion in the early stages where the woman's autonomy would be absolute and a restrictive approach in the later stages where the states's interest in protecting the foetus would justify its prescribing conditions. The precise point in the development of the foetus at which the state's interest in its protection becomes ""compelling"" should be left to the informed judgment of the legislature which is in a position to receive submissions on the subject from all the relevant disciplines.
     Section 251  of the Criminal Code  cannot be saved under s. 1  of the Charter . It takes the decision away from the woman at all stages of her pregnancy and completely denies, as opposed to limits, her right under s. 7 . Section 251  cannot meet the proportionality test; it is not sufficiently tailored to the objective; it does not impair the woman's right ""as little as possible"". Accordingly, even if s. 251  were to be amended to remedy the procedural defects in the legislative scheme, it would still not be constitutionally valid.
     The question whether a foetus is covered by the word ""everyone"" in s. 7  so as to have an independent right to life under that section was not dealt with.
     Per McIntyre and La Forest JJ. (dissenting): Save for the provisions of the Criminal Code  permitting abortion where the life or health of the woman is at risk, no right of abortion can be found in Canadian law, custom or tradition and the Charter , including s. 7 , does not create  


page 39

such a right. Section 251  of the Criminal Code  accordingly does not violate s. 7  of the Charter .
     The power of judicial review of legislation, although given greater scope under the Charter , is not unlimited. The courts must confine themselves to such democratic values as are clearly expressed in the Charter  and refrain from imposing or creating rights with no identifiable base in the Charter . The Court is not entitled to define a right in a manner unrelated to the interest that the right in question was meant to protect.
     The infringement of a right such as the right to security of the person will occur only when legislation goes beyond interfering with priorities and aspirations and abridges rights included in or protected by the concept. The proposition that women enjoy a constitutional right to have an abortion is devoid of support in either the language, structure or history of the constitutional text, in constitutional tradition, or in the history, traditions or underlying philosophies of our society.
     Historically, there has always been a clear recognition of a public interest in the protection of the unborn and there is no evidence or indication of general acceptance of the concept of abortion at will in our society. The interpretive approach to the Charter  adopted by this Court affords no support for the entrenchment of a constitutional right of abortion.
     As to the asserted right to be free from state interference with bodily integrity and serious state-imposed psychological stress, an invasion of the s. 7  right of security of the person, there would have to be more than state-imposed stress or strain. A breach of the right would have to be based upon an infringement of some interest which would be of such nature and such importance as to warrant constitutional protection. This would be limited to cases where the state-action complained of, in addition to imposing stress and strain, also infringed another right, freedom or interest which was deserving of protection under the concept of security of the person. Abortion is not such an interest. Even if a general right to have an abortion could be found under s. 7 , the extent to which such right could be said to be infringed by the requirements of s. 251 of the Code was not clearly shown.
     A defence created by Parliament could only be said to be illusory or practically so when the defence is not available in the circumstances in which it is held out as  


page 40

being available. The very nature of the test assumes that Parliament is to define the defence and, in so doing, designate the terms upon which it may be available. The allegation of procedural unfairness is not supported by the claim that many women wanting abortions have been unable to get them in Canada because the failure of s. 251(4)  to respond to this need. This machinery was considered adequate to deal with the type of abortion Parliament had envisaged. Any inefficiency in the administrative scheme is caused principally by forces external to the statute -- the general demand for abortion irrespective of the provisions of s. 251 . A court cannot strike down a statutory provision on this basis.
     Section 605(1) (a), which gives the Crown a right of appeal against an acquittal in a trial court on any ground involving a question of law alone, does not offend ss. 7 , 11 (d), (f) and (h) of the Charter . The words of s. 11 (h), ""if finally acquitted"" and ""if finally found guilty"", must be construed to mean after the appellate procedures have been completed, otherwise there would be no point or meaning in the word ""finally"".

Section 251  did not infringe the equality rights of women, abridge freedom of religion, or inflict cruel or unusual punishment. The section was not in pith and substance legislation for the protection of health and therefore within provincial competence but rather was validly enacted under the federal criminal law power. There was no merit to the arguments that s. 251  purported to give powers to therapeutic abortion committees exercised by county, district, and superior courts at the time of Confederation or that it delegated powers relating to criminal law to the provinces generally. No evidence supported the defence of necessity.
     Per Curiam: In a trial before judge and jury, the judge's role is to state the law and the jury's role is to apply that law to the facts of the case. To encourage a jury to ignore a law it does not like could not only lead to gross inequities but could also irresponsibly disturb the balance of the criminal law system. It was quite simply wrong to say to the jury that if they did not like the law they need not enforce it. Such practice, if commonly adopted, would undermine and place at risk the whole jury system.

     The judgment of Dickson C.J. and Lamer J. was delivered by
     R. v. MORGENTALER The Chief Justice
     R. c. MORGENTALER Le Juge en chef
     THE CHIEF JUSTICE--The principal issue raised by this appeal is whether the abortion provisions of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, infringe the ""right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice"" as formulated in s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . The appellants, Dr. Henry Morgentaler, Dr. Leslie Frank Smoling and Dr. Robert Scott, have raised thirteen distinct grounds of appeal. During oral submissions, however, it became apparent that the primary focus of the case was upon the s. 7  argument. It is submitted by the appellants that s. 251  of the Criminal Code  contravenes s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and that s. 251  should be struck down. Counsel for the Crown admitted during the course of her submissions that s. 7  of the Charter  was indeed ""the key"" to the entire appeal. As for the remaining grounds of appeal, only a few brief comments are necessary. First of all, I agree with the disposition made by the Court of Appeal of the non-Charter  issues, many of which have already been adequately dealt with in earlier cases by this Court. I am also of the view that the arguments concerning the alleged invalidity of s. 605  under ss. 7  and 11  of the Charter  are unfounded. In view of my resolution of the s. 7  issue, it will not be necessary for me to address the appellants' other Charter  arguments and I expressly refrain from commenting upon their merits.

During argument before this Court, counsel for the Crown emphasized repeatedly that it is not the role of the judiciary in Canada to evaluate the wisdom of legislation enacted by our democratically elected representatives, or to second-guess difficult policy choices that confront all governments. In Morgentaler v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 616, at p. 671, [hereinafter ``Morgentaler (1975)''] I stressed that the Court had ""not been called upon to decide, or even to enter, the loud and continuous public debate on abortion."" Eleven years later, the controversy persists, and it remains  


page 46

true that this Court cannot presume to resolve all of the competing claims advanced in vigorous and healthy public debate. Courts and legislators in other democratic societies have reached completely contradictory decisions when asked to weigh the competing values relevant to the abortion question. See, e.g., Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973); Paton v. United Kingdom (1980), 3 E.H.R.R. (European Court of Human Rights); The Abortion Decision of the Federal Constitutional Court -- First Senate -- of the Federal Republic of Germany, February 25, 1975, translated and reprinted in (1976), 9 John Marshall J. Prac. and Proc. 605; and the Abortion Act, 1967, 1967, c. 87 (U.K.)
     But since 1975, and the first Morgentaler decision, the Court has been given added responsibilities. I stated in Morgentaler (1975), at p. 671, that:
     The values we must accept for the purposes of this appeal are those expressed by Parliament which holds the view that the desire of a woman to be relieved of her pregnancy is not, of itself, justification for performing an abortion.
     Although no doubt it is still fair to say that courts are not the appropriate forum for articulating complex and controversial programmes of public policy, Canadian courts are now charged with the crucial obligation of ensuring that the legislative initiatives pursued by our Parliament and legislatures conform to the democratic values expressed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . As Justice McIntyre states in his reasons for judgment, at p. 138, ""the task of the Court in this case is not to solve nor seek to solve what might be called the abortion issue, but simply to measure the content of s. 251  against the Charter ."" It is in this latter sense that the current Morgentaler appeal differs from the one we heard a decade ago.
     I
     The Court stated the following constitutional questions:


page 47


     1. Does section 251 of the Criminal Code  of Canada infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by ss. 2 (a), 7 , 12 , 15 , 27  and 28  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?
     2. If section 251 of the Criminal Code  of Canada infringes or denies the rights and freedoms guaranteed by ss. 2 (a), 7 , 12 , 15 , 27  and 28  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , is s. 251  justified by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?
     3. Is section 251 of the Criminal Code  of Canada ultra vires the Parliament of Canada?
     4. Does section 251 of the Criminal Code  of Canada violate s. 96  of the Constitution Act, 1867 ?
     5. Does section 251 of the Criminal Code  of Canada unlawfully delegate federal criminal power to provincial Ministers of Health or Therapeutic Abortion Committees, and in doing so, has the Federal Government abdicated its authority in this area?
     6. Do sections 605 and 610(3) of the Criminal Code  of Canada infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by ss. 7 , 11 (d), 11 (f), 11 (h) and 24(1)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?
     7. If sections 605 and 610(3) of the Criminal Code  of Canada infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by ss. 7 , 11 (d) 11(f), 11(h) and 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , are ss. 605  and 610(3)  justified by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?
     The Attorney General of Canada intervened to support the respondent Crown.
     II
     Relevant Statutory and Constitutional Provisions
     Criminal Code 
     251. (1) Every one who, with intent to procure the miscarriage of a female person, whether or not she is pregnant, uses any means for the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

     III
     Procedural History
     The three appellants are all duly qualified medical practitioners who together set up a clinic in Toronto to perform abortions upon women who had not obtained a certificate from a therapeutic abortion committee of an accredited or approved hospital as required by s. 251(4). The doctors had made public statements questioning the wisdom of the abortion laws in Canada and asserting that a woman has an unfettered right to choose whether or not an abortion is appropriate in her individual circumstances.
     Indictments were preferred against the appellants charging that they conspired with each other between November 1982 and July 1983 with intent to procure the miscarriage of female persons, using an induced suction technique to carry out that intent, contrary to s. 423(1) (d) and s. 251(1)  of the Criminal Code .
     Counsel for the appellants moved to quash the indictment or to stay the proceedings before pleas were entered on the grounds that s. 251  of the Criminal Code  was ultra vires the Parliament of Canada, infringed ss. 2 (a), 7  and 12  of the Charter , and was inconsistent with s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. The trial judge, Parker A.C.J.H.C., dismissed the motion, and an appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was dismissed. The trial proceeded before Parker A.C.J.H.C. and a jury, and the three accused were acquitted. The Crown appealed the acquittal to the Court of  


page 51

Appeal and the appellants filed a cross-appeal. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the verdict of acquittal and ordered a new trial. The Court held that the cross-appeal related to issues already raised in the appeal, and the issues were therefore examined as part of the appeal.
     IV
     Section 7  of the Charter 
     In his submissions, counsel for the appellants argued that the Court should recognize a very wide ambit for the rights protected under s. 7  of the Charter . Basing his argument largely on American constitutional theories and authorities, Mr. Manning submitted that the right to ""life, liberty and security of the person"" is a wide-ranging right to control one's own life and to promote one's individual autonomy. The right would therefore include a right to privacy and a right to make unfettered decisions about one's own life.
     In my opinion, it is neither necessary nor wise in this appeal to explore the broadest implications of s. 7  as counsel would wish us to do. I prefer to rest my conclusions on a narrower analysis than that put forward on behalf of the appellants. I do not think it would be appropriate to attempt an all-encompassing explication of so important a provision as s. 7  so early in the history of Charter  interpretation. The Court should be presented with a wide variety of claims and factual situations before articulating the full range of s. 7  rights. I will therefore limit my comments to some interpretive principles already set down by the Court and to an analysis of only two aspects of s. 7 , the right to ""security of the person"" and ""the principles of fundamental justice"".
     A. Interpreting s. 7
     The goal of Charter  interpretation is to secure for all people ""the full benefit of the Charter 's protection"": R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 344. To attain that goal, this  


page 52

Court has held consistently that the proper technique for the interpretation of Charter  provisions is to pursue a ""purposive"" analysis of the right guaranteed. A right recognized in the Charter  is ""to be understood, in other words, in the light of the interests it was meant to protect"": R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., at p. 344. (See also Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145; and R. v. Therens, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 613.)
     In Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177, at p. 204, Justice Wilson emphasized that there are three distinct elements to the s. 7 right, that ""life, liberty, and security of the person"" are independent interests, each of which must be given independent significance by the Court (p. 205). This interpretation was adopted by a majority of the Court, per Justice Lamer, in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at p. 500. It is therefore possible to treat only one aspect of the first part of s. 7 before determining whether any infringement of that interest accords with the principles of fundamental justice. (See Singh, Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, and R. v. Jones, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 284.)
     With respect to the second part of s. 7 , in early academic commentary one of the principal concerns was whether the reference to ""principles of fundamental justice"" enables the courts to review the substance of legislation. (See, e.g., Whyte, ""Fundamental Justice: The Scope and Application of Section 7  of the Charter "" (1983), 13 Man. L.J.  455, and Garant, ""Fundamental Freedoms and Natural Justice"" in W. S. Tarnopolsky and G.-A. Beaudoin, The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms : Commentary (1982).) In Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, Lamer J. noted at p. 497 that any attempt to draw a sharp line between procedure and substance would be ill-conceived. He suggested further that it would not be beneficial in Canada to allow a debate which is rooted in United States constitutional dilemmas to shape our interpretation of s. 7  (p. 498):


page 53


     We would, in my view, do our own Constitution a disservice to simply allow the American debate to define the issue for us, all the while ignoring the truly fundamental structural differences between the two constitutions.
     Lamer J. went on to hold that the principles of fundamental justice referred to in s. 7  can relate both to procedure and to substance, depending upon the circumstances presented before the Court.
     I have no doubt that s. 7  does impose upon courts the duty to review the substance of legislation once it has been determined that the legislation infringes an individual's right to ""life, liberty and security of the person"". The section states clearly that those interests may only be impaired if the principles of fundamental justice are respected. Lamer J. emphasized, however, that the courts should avoid ""adjudication of the merits of public policy"" (p. 499). In the present case, I do not believe that it is necessary for the Court to tread the fine line between substantive review and the adjudication of public policy. As in the Singh case, it will be sufficient to investigate whether or not the impugned legislative provisions meet the procedural standards of fundamental justice. First it is necessary to determine whether s. 251  of the Criminal Code  impairs the security of the person.
     B. Security of the Person
     The law has long recognized that the human body ought to be protected from interference by others. At common law, for example, any medical procedure carried out on a person without that person's consent is an assault. Only in emergency circumstances does the law allow others to make decisions of this nature. Similarly, art. 19 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada provides that ""The human person is inviolable"" and that ""No person may cause harm to the person of another without his consent or without being authorized by law to do so"". ""Security of the person"", in other words, is not a value alien to our legal landscape. With the advent of the Charter , security of the person has been elevated to the status of a constitutional norm. This is not to say that the various forms of  


page 54

protection accorded to the human body by the common and civil law occupy a similar status. ""Security of the person"" must be given content in a manner sensitive to its constitutional position. The above examples are simply illustrative of our respect for individual physical integrity. (See R. Macdonald, ""Procedural Due Process in Canadian Constitutional Law"", 39 U. Fla. L. Rev. 217 (1987), at p. 248.) Nor is it to say that the state can never impair personal security interests. There may well be valid reasons for interfering with security of the person. It is to say, however, that if the state does interfere with security of the person, the Charter  requires such interference to conform with the principles of fundamental justice.
     The appellants submitted that the ""security of the person"" protected by the Charter  is an explicit right to control one's body and to make fundamental decisions about one's life. The Crown contended that ""security of the person"" is a more circumscribed interest and that, like all of the elements of s. 7 , it at most relates to the concept of physical control, simply protecting the individual's interest in his or her bodily integrity.
     Canadian courts have already had occasion to address the scope of the interest protected under the rubric of ""security of the person"". In R. v. Caddedu (1982), 40 O.R. (2d) 128, at p. 139, the Ontario High Court emphasized that the right to security of the person, like each aspect of s. 7 , is a basic right, the deprivation of which has severe consequences for an individual. This characterization was approved by this Court in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, at p. 501. The Ontario Court of Appeal has held that the right to life, liberty and security of the person ""would appear to relate to one's physical or mental integrity and one's control over these...'' (R. v. Videoflicks Ltd.  (1984), 48 O.R. (2d) 395, at p. 433.)


page 55


     That conclusion is consonant with the holding of Lamer J. in Mills v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863. In Mills, Lamer J. was the only judge of this Court to treat the right to security of the person in any detail. Although the right arose in the context of s. 11 (b) of the Charter , Lamer J. stressed the close connection between the specific rights in ss. 8  to 14  and the more generally applicable rights expressed in s. 7 . Lamer J. held, at pp. 919-20, that even in the specific context of s. 11 (b):
     . . . security of the person is not restricted to physical integrity; rather, it encompasses protection against ""overlong subjection to the vexations and vicissitudes of a pending criminal accusation"" . . . These include stigmatization of the accused, loss of privacy, stress and anxiety resulting from a multitude of factors, including possible disruption of family, social life and work, legal costs, uncertainty as to the outcome and sanction.
     If state-imposed psychological trauma infringes security of the person in the rather circumscribed case of s. 11 (b), it should be relevant to the general case of s. 7  where the right is expressed in broader terms. (See Whyte, supra, p. 39).
     I note also that the Court has held in other contexts that the psychological effect of state action is relevant in assessing whether or not a Charter  right has been infringed. In R. v. Therens, at p. 644, Justice Le Dain held that ""The element of psychological compulsion, in the form of a reasonable perception of suspension of freedom of choice, is enough to make the restraint of liberty involuntary"" for the purposes of defining ""detention"" in s. 10  of the Charter . A majority of the Court accepted the conclusions of Le Dain J. on this issue.
     It may well be that constitutional protection of the above interests is specific to, and is only triggered by, the invocation of our system of criminal justice. It must not be forgotten, however, that s. 251 of the Code, subject to subs. (4), makes it an indictable offence for a person to procure the  


page 56

miscarriage and provides a maximum sentence of two years in the case of the woman herself, and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment in the case of another person. Like Beetz J., I do not find it necessary to decide how s. 7  would apply in other cases.
     The case law leads me to the conclusion that state interference with bodily integrity and serious state-imposed psychological stress, at least in the criminal law context, constitute a breach of security of the person. It is not necessary in this case to determine whether the right extends further, to protect either interests central to personal autonomy, such as a right to privacy, or interests unrelated to criminal justice.
     I wish to reiterate that finding a violation of security of the person does not end the s. 7  inquiry. Parliament could choose to infringe security of the person if it did so in a manner consistent with the principles of fundamental justice. The present discussion should therefore be seen as a threshold inquiry and the conclusions do not dispose definitively of all the issues relevant to s. 7 . With that caution, I have no difficulty in concluding that the encyclopedic factual submissions addressed to us by counsel in the present appeal establish beyond any doubt that s. 251  of the Criminal Code  is prima facie a violation of the security of the person of thousands of Canadian women who have made the difficult decision that they do not wish to continue with a pregnancy.
     At the most basic, physical and emotional level, every pregnant woman is told by the section that she cannot submit to a generally safe medical procedure that might be of clear benefit to her unless she meets criteria entirely unrelated to her own priorities and aspirations. Not only does the removal of decision-making power threaten women in a physical sense; the indecision of knowing whether an abortion will be granted inflicts emotional stress. Section 251  clearly interferes with a woman's bodily integrity in both a physical and emotional sense. Forcing a woman, by threat of criminal sanction, to carry a foetus to term unless  


page 57

she meets certain criteria unrelated to her own priorities and aspirations, is a profound interference with a woman's body and thus a violation of security of the person. Section 251 , therefore, is required by the Charter  to comport with the principles of fundamental justice.
     Although this interference with physical and emotional integrity is sufficient in itself to trigger a review of s. 251  against the principles of fundamental justice, the operation of the decision-making mechanism set out in s. 251  creates additional glaring breaches of security of the person. The evidence indicates that s. 251  causes a certain amount of delay for women who are successful in meeting its criteria. In the context of abortion, any unnecessary delay can have profound consequences on the woman's physical and emotional well-being.
     More specifically, in 1977, the Report of the Committee on the Operation of the Abortion Law (the Badgley Report) revealed that the average delay between a pregnant woman's first contact with a physician and a subsequent therapeutic abortion was eight weeks (p. 146). Although the situation appears to have improved since 1977, the extent of the improvement is not clear. The intervener, the Attorney General of Canada, submitted that the average delay in Ontario between the first visit to a physician and a therapeutic abortion was now between one and three weeks. Yet the respondent Crown admitted in a supplementary factum filed on November 27, 1986 with the permission of the Court that (p. 3):
     . . . the evidence discloses that some women may find it very difficult to obtain an abortion: by necessity, abortion services are limited, since hospitals have budgetary, time, space and staff constraints as well as many medical responsibilities. As a result of these problems a woman may have to apply to several hospitals.
     If forced to apply to several different therapeutic abortion committees, there can be no doubt that a woman will experience serious delay in obtaining a  


page 58

therapeutic abortion. In her Report on Therapeu- tic Abortion Services in Ontario (the Powell Report), Dr. Marion Powell emphasized that (p. 7):
     The entire process [of obtaining an abortion] was found to be protracted with women requiring three to seven contacts with health professionals . . . .
     Revealing the full extent of this problem, Dr. Augustin Roy, the President of the Corporation professionnelle des médecins du Québec, testified that studies showed that in Quebec the waiting time for a therapeutic abortion in hospital varied between one and six weeks.
     These periods of delay may not seem unduly long, but in the case of abortion, the implications of any delay, according to the evidence, are potentially devastating. The first factor to consider is that different medical techniques are employed to perform abortions at different stages of pregnancy. The testimony of expert doctors at trial indicated that in the first twelve weeks of pregnancy, the relatively safe and simple suction dilation and curettage method of abortion is typically used in North America. From the thirteenth to the sixteenth week, the more dangerous dilation and evacuation procedure is performed, although much less often in Canada than in the United States. From the sixteenth week of pregnancy, the instillation method is commonly employed in Canada. This method requires the intra-amniotic introduction of prostaglandin, urea, or a saline solution, which causes a woman to go into labour, giving birth to a foetus which is usually dead, but not invariably so. The uncontroverted evidence showed that each method of abortion progressively increases risks to the woman. (See, e.g., Tyler, et al., ""Second Trimester Induced Abortion in the United States"", in Garry S. Berger, William Brenner and Louis Keith, eds., Second-Trimester Abortion: Perspectives After a Decade of Experience.)


page 59


     The second consideration is that even within the periods appropriate to each method of abortion, the evidence indicated that the earlier the abortion was performed, the fewer the complications and the lower the risk of mortality. For example, a study emanating from the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta confirmed that ""D & E [dilation and evacuation] procedures performed at 13 to 15 weeks' gestation were nearly 3 times safer than those performed at 16 weeks or later"". (Cates and Grimes, ""Deaths from Second Trimester Abortion by Dilation and Evacuation: Causes, Prevention, Facilities"" (1981), 58 Obstetrics and Gynecology 401, at p. 401. See also the Powell Report, at p. 36.) The Court was advised that because of their perceptions of risk, Canadian doctors often refuse to use the dilation and evacuation procedure from the thirteenth to sixteenth weeks and instead wait until they consider it appropriate to use the instillation technique. Even more revealing were the overall mortality statistics evaluated by Drs. Cates and Grimes. They concluded from their study of the relevant data that:

Anything that contributes to delay in performing abortions increases the complication rates by 15 to 30%, and the chance of dying by 50% for each week of delay.
     These statistics indicate clearly that even if the average delay caused by s. 251  per arguendo is of only a couple of weeks' duration, the effects upon any particular woman can be serious and, occasionally, fatal.
     It is no doubt true that the overall complication and mortality rates for women who undergo abortions are very low, but the increasing risks caused by delay are so clearly established that I have no difficulty in concluding that the delay in obtaining therapeutic abortions caused by the mandatory procedures of s. 251  is an infringement of the purely physical aspect of the individual's right to security of the person. I should stress that the marked contrast between the relative speed with which abortions can be obtained at the government-sponsored community clinics in Quebec and in hospitals under the s. 251  procedure was  


page 60

established at trial. The evidence indicated that at the government-sponsored clinics in Quebec, the maximum delay was less than a week. One must conclude, and perhaps underline, that the delay experienced by many women seeking a therapeutic abortion, be it of one, two, four, or six weeks' duration, is caused in large measure by the requirements of s. 251  itself.
     The above physical interference caused by the delays created by s. 251 , involving a clear risk of damage to the physical well-being of a woman, is sufficient, in my view, to warrant inquiring whether s. 251  comports with the principles of fundamental justice. However, there is yet another infringement of security of the person. It is clear from the evidence that s. 251  harms the psychological integrity of women seeking abortions. A 1985 report of the Canadian Medical Association, discussed in the Powell Report, at p. 15, emphasized that the procedure involved in s. 251 , with the concomitant delays, greatly increases the stress levels of patients and that this can lead to more physical complications associated with abortion. A specialist in fertility control, Dr. Henry David, was qualified as an expert witness at trial on the psychological impact upon women of delay in the process of obtaining an abortion. He testified that his own studies had demonstrated that there is increased psychological stress imposed upon women who are forced to wait for abortions, and that this stress is compounded by the uncertainty whether or not a therapeutic abortion committee will actually grant approval.
     Perhaps the most powerful testimony regarding the psychological impact upon women caused by the delay inherent in s. 251  procedures was offered at trial by Dr. Jane Hodgson, the Medical Director of the Women's Health Center in Duluth, Minnesota. She was called to testify as to her experiences with Canadian women who had come to the Women's Health Center for abortions. Her testimony was extensive, but the flavour may be gleaned from the following short excerpts:


page 61


     May I add one other thing that I think is very vital, and that is that many of these [Canadian] women come down because they know they will be delayed in getting, first, permission, then delayed in getting a hospital bed, or getting into the hospital, and so they know they will have to have saline [instillation] procedures. And some of them have been through this, and others know what it is about, and they will do almost anything to avoid having a saline procedure.
     And of course, that is -- I consider that a very cruel type of medical care and will do anything to help them to avoid this type of treatment.
     ...
     The cost, the time consumed, the medical risks, the mental anguish -- all of this is cruelty, in this day and age, because it's [the instillation procedure] an obsolete procedure that is essentially disappearing in the United States.
     I have already noted that the instillation procedure requires a woman actually to experience labour and to suffer through the birth of a foetus that is usually but not always dead. Statistics from 1982 indicated that 33.4 per cent of second trimester abortions in Ontario were done by instillation, and the Powell Report revealed, at p. 36, that even in 1986 there persisted a high incidence of second trimester abortions in Ontario. The psychological injury caused by delay in obtaining abortions, much of which must be attributed to the procedures set out in s. 251 , constitutes an additional infringement of the right to security of the person.
     In its supplementary factum and in oral submissions, the Crown argued that evidence of what could be termed ""administrative inefficiency"" is not relevant to the evaluation of legislation for the purposes of s. 7  of the Charter . The Crown argued that only evidence regarding the purpose of legislation is relevant. The assumption, of course, is that any impairment to the physical or psychological interests of individuals caused by s. 251  of the Criminal Code  does not amount to an infringement of security of the person because the injury is caused by practical difficulties and is not intended by the legislator.


page 62


     The submission is faulty on two counts. First, as a practical matter it is not possible in the case of s. 251  to erect a rigid barrier between the purposes of the section and the administrative procedures established to carry those purposes into effect. For example, although it may be true that Parliament did not enact s. 251  intending to create delays in obtaining therapeutic abortions, the evidence demonstrates that the system established by the section for obtaining a therapeutic abortion certificate inevitably does create significant delays. It is not possible to say that delay results only from administrative constraints, such as limited budgets or a lack of qualified persons to sit on therapeutic abortion committees. Delay results from the cumbersome operating requirements of s. 251  itself. (See, by way of analogy, R. v. Therens, per Le Dain J., at p. 645.) Although the mandate given to the courts under the Charter  does not, generally speaking, enable the judiciary to provide remedies for administrative inefficiencies, when denial of a right as basic as security of the person is infringed by the procedure and administrative structures created by the law itself, the courts are empowered to act.
     Secondly, were it nevertheless possible in this case to dissociate purpose and administration, this Court has already held as a matter of law that purpose is not the only appropriate criterion in evaluating the constitutionality of legislation under the Charter . In R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., at p. 331, the Court stated that:
     . . . both purpose and effect are relevant in determining constitutionality; either an unconstitutional purpose or an unconstitutional effect can invalidate legislation.
     Even if the purpose of legislation is unobjectionable, the administrative procedures created by law to bring that purpose into operation may produce unconstitutional effects, and the legislation should then be struck down. It is important to note that, in speaking of the effects of legislation, the Court in R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd. was still referring to effects that can invalidate legislation under s. 52  of the Constitution Act, 1982  and not to individual effects that might lead a court to provide a  


page 63

personal remedy under s. 24(1)  of the Charter . In the present case, the appellants are complaining of the general effects of s. 251 . If section 251 of the Criminal Code  does indeed breach s. 7  of the Charter  through its general effects, that can be sufficient to invalidate the legislation under s. 52 . As an aside, I should note that the appellants have standing to challenge an unconstitutional law if they are liable to conviction for an offence under that law even though the unconstitutional effects are not directed at the appellants per se: R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., at p. 313. The standing of the appellants was not challenged by the Crown.
     In summary, s. 251 is a law which forces women to carry a foetus to term contrary to their own priorities and aspirations and which imposes serious delay causing increased physical and psychological trauma to those women who meet its criteria. It must, therefore, be determined whether that infringement is accomplished in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice, thereby saving s. 251 under the second part of s. 7 .
     C. The Principles of Fundamental Justice
     Although the ""principles of fundamental justice"" referred to in s. 7  have both a substantive and a procedural component (Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, at p. 499), I have already indicated that it is not necessary in this appeal to evaluate the substantive content of s. 251  of the Criminal Code . My discussion will therefore be limited to various aspects of the administrative structure and procedure set down in s. 251  for access to therapeutic abortions.
     In outline, s. 251  operates in the following manner. Subsection (1) creates an indictable offence for any person to use any means with the intent ""to procure the miscarriage of a female person"". Subsection (2) establishes a parallel indictable offence for any pregnant woman to use or to permit any means to be used with the intent ""to procure her own miscarriage"". The ""means"" referred to in subss. (1) and (2) are defined in subs. (3) as the administration of a drug or ""other noxious thing"", the use of an instrument, and  


page 64

""manipulation of any kind"". The crucial provision for the purposes of the present appeal is subs. (4) which states that the offences created in subss. (1) and (2) ""do not apply"" in certain circumstances. The Ontario Court of Appeal in the proceedings below characterized s. 251(4) as an ""exculpatory provision"" ((1985), 52 O.R. (2d) 353, at p. 365). In Morgentaler (1975), at p. 673, a majority of this Court held that the effect of s. 251(4) was to afford ""a complete answer and defence to those who respect its terms"".
     The procedure surrounding the defence is rather complex. A pregnant woman who desires to have an abortion must apply to the ""therapeutic abortion committee"" of an ""accredited or approved hospital"". Such a committee is empowered to issue a certificate in writing stating that in the opinion of a majority of the committee, the continuation of the pregnancy would be likely to endanger the pregnant woman's life or health. Once a copy of the certificate is given to a qualified medical practitioner who is not a member of the therapeutic abortion committee, he or she is permitted to perform an abortion on the pregnant woman and both the doctor and the woman are freed from any criminal liability.
     A number of definitions are provided in subs. (6) which have a bearing on the disposition of this appeal. An ""accredited hospital"" is described as a hospital accredited by the Canadian Council on Hospital Accreditation ""in which diagnostic services and medical, surgical and obstetrical treatment"" are provided. An ""approved hospital"" is a hospital ""approved for the purposes of this section by the Minister of Health"" of a province. A ""therapeutic abortion committee"" must be ""comprised of not less than three members each of whom is a qualified medical practitioner"" who is appointed by a hospital's administrative board. Interestingly, the term ""health"" is not defined for the purposes of s. 251 , so it would appear that the therapeutic abortion committees are free to develop their own theories as to when a potential impairment of a woman's ""health"" would justify the granting of a therapeutic abortion certificate.


page 65


     As is so often the case in matters of interpretation, however, the straightforward reading of this statutory scheme is not fully revealing. In order to understand the true nature and scope of s. 251 , it is necessary to investigate the practical operation of the provisions. The Court has been provided with a myriad of factual submissions in this area. One of the most useful sources of information is the Badgley Report. The Committee on the Operation of the Abortion Law was established by Orders-in-Council P.C. 1975-2305, -2306, and -2307 of September 29, 1975 and its terms of reference instructed it to ""conduct a study to determine whether the procedure provided in the Criminal Code for obtaining therapeutic abortions is operating equitably across Canada"". Statistics were provided to the Committee by Statistics Canada and the Committee conducted its own research, meeting with officials of the departments of the provincial attorneys general and of health, and visiting 140 hospitals throughout Canada. The Committee also commissioned national hospital, hospital staff, physician, and patient surveys. The overall conclusion of the Committee was that ""The procedures set out for the operation of the Abortion Law are not working equitably across Canada"" (p. 17). Of course, that conclusion does not lead to the necessary inference that s. 251  procedures violate the principles of fundamental justice. Unfair functioning of the law could be caused by external forces which do not relate to the law itself.
     The Badgley Report contains a wealth of detailed information which demonstrates, however, that many of the most serious problems with the functioning of s. 251  are created by procedural and administrative requirements established in the law. For example, the Badgley Committee noted, at p. 84, that:
     . . . the Abortion Law implicitly establishes a minimum requirement of three qualified physicians to serve on a therapeutic abortion committee, plus a qualified medical practitioner who is not a member of the therapeutic abortion committee, to perform the procedure.
     The Committee went on to make the following observation at p. 102:


page 66


     Of the 1,348 civilian hospitals in operation in 1976, at least 331 hospitals had less than four physicians on their medical staff. In terms of the distribution of physicians, 24.6 percent of hospitals in Canada did not have a medical staff which was large enough to establish a therapeutic abortion committee and to perform the abortion procedure.
     In other words, the seemingly neutral requirement of s. 251(4) that at least four physicians be available to authorize and to perform an abortion meant in practice that abortions would be absolutely unavailable in almost one quarter of all hospitals in Canada.
     Other administrative and procedural requirements of s. 251(4) reduce the availability of therapeutic abortions even further. For the purposes of s. 251 , therapeutic abortions can only be performed in ""accredited"" or ""approved"" hospitals. As noted above, an ""approved"" hospital is one which a provincial minister of health has designated as such for the purpose of performing therapeutic abortions. The minister is under no obligation to grant any such approval. Furthermore, an ""accredited"" hospital must not only be accredited by the Canadian Council on Hospital Accreditation, it must also provide specified services. Many Canadian hospitals do not provide all of the required services, thereby being automatically disqualified from undertaking therapeutic abortions. The Badgley Report stressed the remarkable limitations created by these requirements, especially when linked with the four-physician rule discussed above (p. 105):
     Of the total of 1,348 non-military hospitals in Canada in 1976, 789 hospitals, or 58.5 percent, were ineligible in terms of their major treatment functions, the size of their medical staff, or their type of facility to establish therapeutic abortion committees.
     Moreover, even if a hospital is eligible to create a therapeutic abortion committee, there is no requirement in s. 251  that the hospital need do so. The Badgley Committee discovered that in 1976, of the 559 general hospitals which met the  


page 67

procedural requirements of s. 251 , only 271 hospitals in Canada, or only 20.1 per cent of the total, had actually established a therapeutic abortion committee (p. 105).
     Even though the Badgley Report was issued ten years ago, the relevant statistics do not appear to be out of date. Indeed, Statistics Canada reported that in 1982 the number of hospitals with therapeutic abortion committees had actually fallen to 261. (Basic Facts on Therapeutic Abortions, Canada: 1982 (1983).) Even more recent data exists for Ontario. In the Powell Report, it was noted that in 1986 only 54 per cent of accredited acute care hospitals in the province had therapeutic abortion committees. In five counties there were no committees at all (p. 24). Of the 95 hospitals with committees, 12 did not do any abortions in 1986 (p. 24).
     The Powell Report reveals another serious difficulty with s. 251  procedures. The requirement that therapeutic abortions be performed only in ""accredited"" or ""approved"" hospitals effectively means that the practical availability of the exculpatory provisions of subs. (4) may be heavily restricted, even denied, through provincial regulation. In Ontario, for example, the provincial government promulgated O. Reg. 248/70 under The Public Hospitals Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 322, now R.R.O. 1980, Reg. 865. This regulation provides that therapeutic abortion committees can only be established where there are ten or more members on the active medical staff (Powell Report, at p. 13). A minister of health is not prevented from imposing harsher restrictions. During argument, it was noted that it would even be possible for a provincial government, exercising its legislative authority over public hospitals, to distribute funding for treatment facilities in such a way that no hospital would meet the procedural requirements of s. 251(4). Because of the administrative structure established in s. 251(4) and the related definitions, the ""defence"" created in the section could be completely wiped out.


page 68


     A further flaw with the administrative system established in s. 251(4) is the failure to provide an adequate standard for therapeutic abortion committees which must determine when a therapeutic abortion should, as a matter of law, be granted. Subsection (4) states simply that a therapeutic abortion committee may grant a certificate when it determines that a continuation of a pregnancy would be likely to endanger the ""life or health"" of the pregnant woman. It was noted above that ""health"" is not defined for the purposes of the section. The Crown admitted in its supplementary factum that the medical witnesses at trial testified uniformly that the ""health"" standard was ambiguous, but the Crown derives comfort from the fact that ""the medical witnesses were unanimous in their approval of the broad World Health Organization definition of health"". The World Health Organization defines ""health"" not merely as the absence of disease or infirmity, but as a state of physical, mental and social well-being.
     I do not understand how the mere existence of a workable definition of ""health"" can make the use of the word in s. 251(4) any less ambiguous when that definition is nowhere referred to in the section. There is no evidence that therapeutic abortion committees are commonly applying the World Health Organization definition. Indeed, the Badgley Report indicates that the situation is quite the contrary (p. 20):
     There has been no sustained or firm effort in Canada to develop an explicit and operational definition of health, or to apply such a concept directly to the operation of induced abortion. In the absence of such a definition, each physician and each hospital reaches an individual decision on this matter. How the concept of health is variably defined leads to considerable inequity in the distribution and the accessibility of the abortion procedure.
     Various expert doctors testified at trial that therapeutic abortion committees apply widely differing definitions of health. For some committees, psychological health is a justification for therapeutic abortion; for others it is not. Some committees routinely refuse abortions to married women  


page 69

unless they are in physical danger, while for other committees it is possible for a married woman to show that she would suffer psychological harm if she continued with a pregnancy, thereby justifying an abortion. It is not typically possible for women to know in advance what standard of health will be applied by any given committee. Parker A.C.J.H.C., at p. 377, found clear evidence that s. 251(4) provided no adequate guidelines for therapeutic abortion committees charged with determining when an abortion should legally be available:
     The [Badgley] report, and other evidence adduced in support of this motion, indicates that each therapeutic abortion committee is free to establish its own guidelines and many committees apply arbitrary requirements. Some committees refuse to approve applications for second abortions unless the patient consents to sterilization, others require psychiatric assessment, and others do not grant approval to married women.
     It is no answer to say that ""health"" is a medical term and that doctors who sit on therapeutic abortion committees must simply exercise their professional judgment. A therapeutic abortion committee is a strange hybrid, part medical committee and part legal committee. Again, in the words of Parker A.C.J.H.C., at p. 381:
     Given the consequences of the issuing or refusing to issue a certificate, I have some difficulty in reducing the committee's powers to merely that of stating its opinion as to the likelihood of the continuation of the pregnancy endangering the applicant's life or health. The decision of the committee has a very real effect on access to abortion for the pregnant female applicant, and the potential criminal liability of both the applicant and the physician who performs the operation.
     When the decision of the therapeutic abortion committee is so directly laden with legal consequences, the absence of any clear legal standard to be applied by the committee in reaching its decision is a serious procedural flaw.


page 70


     The combined effect of all of these problems with the procedure stipulated in s. 251  for access to therapeutic abortions is a failure to comply with the principles of fundamental justice. In Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, Lamer J. held, at p. 503, that ""the principles of fundamental justice are to be found in the basic tenets of our legal system"". One of the basic tenets of our system of criminal justice is that when Parliament creates a defence to a criminal charge, the defence should not be illusory or so difficult to attain as to be practically illusory. The criminal law is a very special form of governmental regulation, for it seeks to express our society's collective disapprobation of certain acts and omissions. When a defence is provided, especially a specifically-tailored defence to a particular charge, it is because the legislator has determined that the disapprobation of society is not warranted when the conditions of the defence are met.
     Consider then the case of a pregnant married woman who wishes to apply for a therapeutic abortion certificate because she fears that her psychological health would be impaired seriously if she carried the foetus to term. The uncontroverted evidence reveals that there are many areas in Canada where such a woman would simply not have access to a therapeutic abortion. She may live in an area where no hospital has four doctors; no therapeutic abortion committee can be created. Equally, she may live in a place where the treatment functions of the nearby hospitals do not satisfy the definition of ""accredited hospital"" in s. 251(6). Or she may live in a province where the provincial government has imposed such stringent requirements on hospitals seeking to create therapeutic abortion committees that no hospital can qualify. Alternatively, our hypothetical woman may confront a therapeutic abortion committee in her local hospital which defines ""health"" in purely physical terms or which refuses to countenance abortions for married women. In each of these cases, it is the administrative structures and procedures established by s. 251  itself that would in  


page 71

practice prevent the woman from gaining the benefit of the defence held out to her in s. 251(4).
     The facts indicate that many women do indeed confront these problems. Doctors from the Chedoke-McMaster Hospital in Hamilton testified that they received telephone calls from women throughout Ontario who had applied for therapeutic abortions at local hospitals and been refused. At one point, 80 per cent of abortion patients at Chedoke-McMaster were from outside Hamilton, and the hospital was forced to restrict access for women from outside its catchment area. The Powell Report revealed that in over 50 per cent of Ontario counties in 1986, the majority of women obtaining abortions had the procedure away from their place of residence (p. 7). Even more telling is the fact that ""a minimum of 5000 Ontario women obtain abortions each year in freestanding clinics in Canada and the United States"" (p. 7).
     The Crown argues in its supplementary factum that women who face difficulties in obtaining abortions at home can simply travel elsewhere in Canada to procure a therapeutic abortion. That submission would not be especially troubling if the difficulties facing women were not in large measure created by the procedural requirements of s. 251  itself. If women were seeking anonymity outside their home town or were simply confronting the reality that it is often difficult to obtain medical services in rural areas, it might be appropriate to say ""let them travel"". But the evidence establishes convincingly that it is the law itself which in many ways prevents access to local therapeutic abortion facilities. The enormous emotional and financial burden placed upon women who must travel long distances from home to obtain an abortion is a burden created in many instances by Parliament. Moreover, it is not accurate to say to women who would seem to qualify under s. 251(4) that they can get a therapeutic abortion as long as  


page 72

they are willing to travel. Ms. Carolyn Egan, administrative co-ordinator of the Birth Control and Venereal Disease Centre of Toronto, testified that many hospitals in Toronto had been forced to establish arbitrary abortion quotas, and that some Toronto hospitals restricted access to women inside the geographical area the hospitals were designated to serve. A woman from outside Toronto could run into serious difficulties attempting to procure a therapeutic abortion in that city. As noted above, the situation in Hamilton is now comparable to that in Toronto, because of the geographic restrictions imposed at the Chedoke-McMaster Hospital. Meanwhile, of course, days and weeks may pass and a woman may ultimately be forced to undergo a more dangerous abortion procedure. Or she may become desperate and choose to travel even further afield, to Quebec or to the United States, to obtain an abortion in a free-standing clinic.
     A majority of this Court held in R. v. Jones, at p. 304, per La Forest J., that:
     The provinces must be given room to make choices regarding the type of administrative structure that will suit their needs unless the use of such structure is in itself so manifestly unfair, having regard to the decisions it is called upon to make, as to violate the principles of fundamental justice. [Emphasis in original.]
     Similarly, Parliament must be given room to design an appropriate administrative and procedural structure for bringing into operation a particular defence to criminal liability. But if that structure is ""so manifestly unfair, having regard to the decisions it is called upon to make, as to violate the principles of fundamental justice"", that structure must be struck down. In the present case, the structure -- the system regulating access to therapeutic abortions -- is manifestly unfair. It contains so many potential barriers to its own operation that the defence it creates will in many circumstances be practically unavailable to women  


page 73

who would prima facie qualify for the defence, or at least would force such women to travel great distances at substantial expense and inconvenience in order to benefit from a defence that is held out to be generally available.
     I conclude that the procedures created in s. 251  of the Criminal Code  for obtaining a therapeutic abortion do not comport with the principles of fundamental justice. It is not necessary to determine whether s. 7  also contains a substantive content leading to the conclusion that, in some circumstances at least, the deprivation of a pregnant woman's right to security of the person can never comport with fundamental justice. Simply put, assuming Parliament can act, it must do so properly. For the reasons given earlier, the deprivation of security of the person caused by s. 251  as a whole is not in accordance with the second clause of s. 7 . It remains to be seen whether s. 251  can be justified for the purposes of s. 1  of the Charter .

V
     Section 1  Analysis
     Section 1  of the Charter  can potentially be used to ""salvage"" a legislative provision which breaches s. 7 : Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, per Lamer J., at p. 520. The principles governing the necessary analysis under s. 1  were set down in R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., and, more precisely, in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103. A statutory provision which infringes any section of the Charter  can only be saved under s. 1  if the party seeking to uphold the provision can demonstrate first, that the objective of the provision is ""of sufficient importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right or freedom"" (R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., at p. 352) and second, that the means chosen in overriding the right or freedom are reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. This second aspect ensures that the legislative means are proportional to the legislative ends (Oakes, at pp. 139-40). In Oakes, at p. 139, the Court referred to three considerations which are typically useful in assessing the  


page 74

proportionality of means to ends. First, the means chosen to achieve an important objective should be rational, fair and not arbitrary. Second, the legislative means should impair as little as possible the right or freedom under consideration. Third, the effects of the limitation upon the relevant right or freedom should not be out of proportion to the objective sought to be achieved.
     The appellants contended that the sole purpose of s. 251  of the Criminal Code  is to protect the life and health of pregnant women. The respondent Crown submitted that s. 251  seeks to protect not only the life and health of pregnant women, but also the interests of the foetus. On the other hand, the Crown conceded that the Court is not called upon in this appeal to evaluate any claim to ""foetal rights"" or to assess the meaning of ""the right to life"". I expressly refrain from so doing. In my view, it is unnecessary for the purpose of deciding this appeal to evaluate or assess ""foetal rights"" as an independent constitutional value. Nor are we required to measure the full extent of the state's interest in establishing criteria unrelated to the pregnant woman's own priorities and aspirations. What we must do is evaluate the particular balance struck by Parliament in s. 251 , as it relates to the priorities and aspirations of pregnant women and the government's interests in the protection of the foetus.
     Section 251  provides that foetal interests are not to be protected where the ""life or health"" of the woman is threatened. Thus, Parliament itself has expressly stated in s. 251  that the ""life or health"" of pregnant women is paramount. The procedures of s. 251(4) are clearly related to the pregnant woman's ""life or health"" for that is the very phrase used by the subsection. As McIntyre J. states in his reasons (at p. 155), the aim of s. 251(4) is ""to restrict abortion to cases where the continuation of the pregnancy would, or would likely, be injurious  


page 75

to the life or health of the woman concerned, not to provide unrestricted access to abortion."" I have no difficulty in concluding that the objective of s. 251  as a whole, namely, to balance the competing interests identified by Parliament, is sufficiently important to meet the requirements of the first step in the Oakes inquiry under s. 1 . I think the protection of the interests of pregnant women is a valid governmental objective, where life and health can be jeopardized by criminal sanctions. Like Beetz and Wilson JJ., I agree that protection of foetal interests by Parliament is also a valid governmental objective. It follows that balancing these interests, with the lives and health of women a major factor, is clearly an important governmental objective. As the Court of Appeal stated at p. 366, ""the contemporary view [is] that abortion is not always socially undesirable behavior.""
     I am equally convinced, however, that the means chosen to advance the legislative objectives of s. 251  do not satisfy any of the three elements of the proportionality component of R. v. Oakes. The evidence has led me to conclude that the infringement of the security of the person of pregnant women caused by s. 251  is not accomplished in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. It has been demonstrated that the procedures and administrative structures created by s. 251  are often arbitrary and unfair. The procedures established to implement the policy of s. 251  impair s. 7  rights far more than is necessary because they hold out an illusory defence to many women who would prima facie qualify under the exculpatory provisions of s. 251(4). In other words, many women whom Parliament professes not to wish to subject to criminal liability will nevertheless be forced by the practical unavailability of the supposed defence to risk liability or to suffer other harm such as a traumatic late abortion caused by the delay inherent in the s. 251  system. Finally, the effects of the limitation upon the s. 7  rights of many pregnant women are out of proportion to the objective sought to be achieved. Indeed, to the  


page 76

extent that s. 251(4) is designed to protect the life and health of women, the procedures it establishes may actually defeat that objective. The administrative structures of s. 251(4) are so cumbersome that women whose health is endangered by pregnancy may not be able to gain a therapeutic abortion, at least without great trauma, expense and inconvenience.
     I conclude, therefore, that the cumbersome structure of subs. (4) not only unduly subordinates the s. 7  rights of pregnant women but may also defeat the value Parliament itself has established as paramount, namely, the life and health of the pregnant woman. As I have noted, counsel for the Crown did contend that one purpose of the procedures required by subs. (4) is to protect the interests of the foetus. State protection of foetal interests may well be deserving of constitutional recognition under s. 1 . Still, there can be no escape from the fact that Parliament has failed to establish either a standard or a procedure whereby any such interests might prevail over those of the woman in a fair and non-arbitrary fashion.
     Section 251  of the Criminal Code  cannot be saved, therefore, under s. 1  of the Charter .
     VI
     Defence Counsel's Address to the Jury 
     In his concluding remarks to the jury at the trial of the appellants, defence counsel asserted:
     The judge will tell you what the law is. He will tell you about the ingredients of the offence, what the Crown has to prove, what the defences may be or may not be, and you must take the law from him. But I submit to you that it is up to you and you alone to apply the law to this evidence and you have a right to say it shouldn't be applied.


page 77


     The burden of his argument was that the jury should not apply s. 251  if they thought that it was a bad law, and that, in refusing to apply the law, they could send a signal to Parliament that the law should be changed. Although my disposition of the appeal makes it unnecessary, strictly speaking, to review Mr. Manning's argument before the jury, I find the argument so troubling that I feel compelled to comment.
     It has long been settled in Anglo-Canadian criminal law that in a trial before judge and jury, the judge's role is to state the law and the jury's role is to apply that law to the facts of the case. In Joshua v. The Queen, [1955] A.C. 121 (P.C.), at p. 130, Lord Oaksey enunciated the principle succinctly:
     It is a general principle of British law that on a trial by jury it is for the judge to direct the jury on the law and in so far as he thinks necessary on the facts, but the jury, whilst they must take the law from the judge, are the sole judges on the facts.
     The jury is one of the great protectors of the citizen because it is composed of twelve persons who collectively express the common sense of the community. But the jury members are not expert in the law, and for that reason they must be guided by the judge on questions of law.
     The contrary principle contended for by Mr. Manning, that a jury may be encouraged to ignore a law it does not like, could lead to gross inequities. One accused could be convicted by a jury who supported the existing law, while another person indicted for the same offence could be acquitted by a jury who, with reformist zeal, wished to express disapproval of the same law. Moreover, a jury could decide that although the law pointed to a conviction, the jury would simply refuse to apply the law to an accused for whom it had sympathy. Alternatively, a jury who feels antipathy towards an accused might convict despite a law which points to acquittal. To give a harsh but I think telling example, a jury fueled by the passions of racism could be told that they need not apply the law against murder to a white man who had killed a black man. Such a possibility need only be stated to reveal the potentially frightening implications of  


page 78

Mr. Manning's assertions. The dangerous argument that a jury may be encouraged to disregard the law was castigated as long ago as 1784 by Lord Mansfield in a criminal libel case, R. v. Shipley (1784), 4 Dougl. 73, 99 E.R. 774, at p. 824:
     So the jury who usurp the judicature of law, though they happen to be right, are themselves wrong, because they are right by chance only, and have not taken the constitutional way of deciding the question. It is the duty of the Judge, in all cases of general justice, to tell the jury how to do right, though they have it in their power to do wrong, which is a matter entirely between God and their own consciences.
     To be free is to live under a government by law . . . . Miserable is the condition of individuals, dangerous is the condition of the State, if there is no certain law, or, which is the same thing, no certain administration of law, to protect individuals, or to guard the State.
     ...
     In opposition to this, what is contended for? -- That the law shall be, in every particular cause, what any twelve men, who shall happen to be the jury, shall be inclined to think; liable to no review, and subject to no control, under all the prejudices of the popular cry of the day, and under all the bias of interest in this town, where thousands, more or less, are concerned in the publication of newspapers, paragraphs, and pamphlets. Under such an administration of law, no man could tell, no counsel could advise, whether a paper was or was not punishable.
     I can only add my support to that eloquent statement of principle.
     It is no doubt true that juries have a de facto power to disregard the law as stated to the jury by the judge. We cannot enter the jury room. The jury is never called upon to explain the reasons which lie behind a verdict. It may even be true that in some limited circumstances the private decision of a jury to refuse to apply the law will constitute, in the words of a Law Reform Commission of Canada working paper, ""the citizen's ultimate protection against oppressive laws and the oppressive enforcement of the law"" (Law Reform Commission of Canada, Working Paper 27, The Jury in Criminal Trials (1980)). But recognizing this reality is a far cry from suggesting that  


page 79

counsel may encourage a jury to ignore a law they do not support or to tell a jury that it has a right to do so. The difference between accepting the reality of de facto discretion in applying the law and elevating such discretion to the level of a right was stated clearly by the United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, in United States v. Dougherty, 473 F.2d 1113 (1972), per Leventhal J., at p. 1134:
     The jury system has worked out reasonably well overall, providing ""play in the joints"" that imparts flexibility and avoid[s] undue rigidity. An equilibrium has evolved -- an often marvelous balance -- with the jury acting as a ""safety valve"" for exceptional cases, without being a wildcat or runaway institution. There is reason to believe that the simultaneous achievement of modest jury equity and avoidance of intolerable caprice depends on formal instructions that do not expressly delineate a jury charter to carve out its own rules of law.
     To accept Mr. Manning's argument that defence counsel should be able to encourage juries to ignore the law would be to disturb the ""marvelous balance"" of our system of criminal trials before a judge and jury. Such a disturbance would be irresponsible. I agree with the trial judge and with the Court of Appeal that Mr. Manning was quite simply wrong to say to the jury that if they did not like the law they need not enforce it. He should not have done so.
     VII
     Conclusion
     Section 251  of the Criminal Code  infringes the right to security of the person of many pregnant women. The procedures and administrative structures established in the section to provide for therapeutic abortions do not comply with the principles of fundamental justice. Section 7  of the Charter  is infringed and that infringement cannot be saved under s. 1 .
     In oral argument, counsel for the Crown submitted that if the Court were to hold that procedural aspects of s. 251  infringed the Charter , only the procedures set out in the section should be struck  


page 80

down, that is subss. (4) and (5). After being pressed with questions from the bench, Ms. Wein conceded that the whole of s. 251  should fall if it infringed s. 7 . Mr. Blacklock for the Attorney General of Canada took the same position. This was a wise approach, for in Morgentaler (1975), at p. 676, the Court held that ""s. 251  contains a comprehensive code on the subject of abortions, unitary and complete within itself"". Having found that this ""comprehensive code"" infringes the Charter , it is not the role of the Court to pick and choose among the various aspects of s. 251  so as effectively to re-draft the section. The appeal should therefore be allowed and s. 251  as a whole struck down under s. 52(1)  of the Constitution Act, 1982 .
     The first constitutional question is therefore answered in the affirmative as regards s. 7  of the Charter  only. The second question, as regards s. 7  of the Charter  only, is answered in the negative. Questions 3, 4 and 5 are answered in the negative. I answer question 6 in the manner proposed by Beetz J. It is not necessary to answer question 7.
     The reasons of Beetz and Estey JJ. were delivered by
     R. v. MORGENTALER Beetz J.
     R. c. MORGENTALER Le juge Beetz
     BEETZ J.--I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment written by the Chief Justice, as well as the reasons written by Justice McIntyre and Justice Wilson.
     I agree with the Chief Justice and Wilson J. that this case finds its resolution in the answers to the first two constitutional questions stated by the Chief Justice in so far as those questions relate to s. 7  and s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . Although the greatest part of my reasons is devoted to responding to the first two constitutional questions, I consider it necessary to answer the sixth constitutional question concerning the validity of s. 605(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, under the Charter  in order to establish the Crown's right to appeal the verdict of acquittal in this case. Finally, I have decided that it is appropriate to address the appellants' arguments pertaining to s. 91(27) and s. 96 of the  


page 81

Constitution Act, 1867 , as well as the argument that s. 251  of the Criminal Code  is in effect an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.
     Like the Chief Justice and Wilson J., I would allow the appeal and answer the first constitutional question in the affirmative and the second constitutional question in the negative. This however is a result which I reach for reasons which differ from those of the Chief Justice and those of Wilson J.
     I find it convenient to outline at the outset the steps which lead me to this result:
     I -- Before the advent of the Charter , Parliament recognized, in adopting s. 251(4) (c) of the Criminal Code , that the interest in the life or health of the pregnant woman takes precedence over the interest in prohibiting abortions, including the interest of the state in the protection of the foetus, when ""the continuation of the pregnancy of such female person would or would be likely to endanger her life or health"". In my view, this standard in s. 251(4)  became entrenched at least as a minimum when the ""right to life, liberty and security of the person"" was enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  at s. 7 .

II -- ""Security of the person"" within the meaning of s. 7  of the Charter  must include a right of access to medical treatment for a condition representing a danger to life or health without fear of criminal sanction. If an act of Parliament forces a pregnant woman whose life or health is in danger to choose between, on the one hand, the commission of a crime to obtain effective and timely medical treatment and, on the other hand, inadequate treatment or no treatment at all, her right to security of the person has been violated.
     III -- According to the evidence, the procedural requirements of s. 251  of the Criminal Code  significantly delay pregnant women's access to medical treatment resulting in an additional danger to their health, thereby depriving them of their right to security of the person.


page 82


     IV -- The deprivation referred to in the preceding proposition does not accord with the principles of fundamental justice. While Parliament is justified in requiring a reliable, independent and medically sound opinion as to the ""life or health"" of the pregnant woman in order to protect the state interest in the foetus, and while any such statutory mechanism will inevitably result in some delay, certain of the procedural requirements of s. 251  of the Criminal Code  are nevertheless manifestly unfair. These requirements are manifestly unfair in that they are unnecessary in respect of Parliament's objectives in establishing the administrative structure and that they result in additional risks to the health of pregnant women.
     V -- The primary objective of s. 251  of the Criminal Code  is the protection of the foetus. The protection of the life and health of the pregnant woman is an ancillary objective. The primary objective does relate to concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society and which, pursuant to s. 1  of the Charter , justify reasonable limits to be put on a woman's right. However, rules unnecessary in respect of the primary and ancillary objectives which they are designed to serve, such as some of the rules contained in s. 251 , cannot be said to be rationally connected to these objectives under s. 1  of the Charter . Consequently, s. 251 does not constitute a reasonable limit to the security of the person.
     It is not necessary to decide whether there is a proportionality between the effects of s. 251 and the objective of protecting the foetus, nor is it necessary to answer the question concerning the circumstances in which there is a proportionality between the effects of s. 251 which limit the right of pregnant women to security of the person and the objective of the protection of the foetus. But I feel bound to observe that the objective of protecting the foetus would not justify the severity of the breach of pregnant women's right to security of the person which would result if the exculpatory provision of s. 251 was completely removed from the Criminal Code . However, a rule that would require a higher degree of danger to health in the  


page 83

latter months of pregnancy, as opposed to the early months, for an abortion to be lawful, could pos- sibly achieve a proportionality which would be acceptable under s. 1  of the Charter .
     I -- Section 251  of the Criminal Code 
     Section 251  of the Criminal Code  provides:
     251. (1) Every one who, with intent to procure the miscarriage of a female person, whether or not she is pregnant, uses any means for the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.
     (2) Every female person who, being pregnant, with intent to procure her own miscarriage, uses any means or permits any means to be used for the purpose of carrying out her intention is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.

(3) In this section, ""means"" includes
     (a) the administration of a drug or other noxious thing,
     (b) the use of an instrument, and
     (c) manipulation of any kind.
     (4) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to
     (a) a qualified medical practitioner, other than a member of a therapeutic abortion committee for any hospital, who in good faith uses in an accredited or approved hospital any means for the purpose of carrying out his intention to procure the miscarriage of a female person, or
     (b) a female person who, being pregnant, permits a qualified medical practitioner to use in an accredited or approved hospital any means described in paragraph (a) for the purpose of carrying out her intention to procure her own miscarriage,
     if, before the use of those means, the therapeutic abortion committee for that accredited or approved hospital, by a majority of the members of the committee and at a meeting of the committee at which the case of such female person has been reviewed,
     (c) has by certificate in writing stated that in its opinion the continuation of the pregnancy of such female person would or would be likely to endanger her life or health, and
     (d) has caused a copy of such certificate to be given to the qualified medical practitioner.
     (5) The Minister of Health of a province may by order


page 84


     (a) require a therapeutic abortion committee for any hospital in that province, or any member thereof, to furnish to him a copy of any certificate described in paragraph (4)(c) issued by that committee, together with such other information relating to the circumstances surrounding the issue of that certificate as he may require, or
     (b) require a medical practitioner who, in that province, has procured the miscarriage of any female person named in a certificate described in paragraph (4)(c), to furnish to him a copy of that certificate, together with such other information relating to the procuring of the miscarriage as he may require.
     (6) For the purposes of subsections (4) and (5) and this subsection
     ""accredited hospital"" means a hospital accredited by the Canadian Council on Hospital Accreditation in which diagnostic services and medical, surgical and obstetrical treatment are provided;
     ""approved hospital"" means a hospital in a province approved for the purposes of this section by the Minister of Health of that province;
     ""board"" means the board of governors, management or directors, or the trustees, commission or other person or group of persons having the control and management of an accredited or approved hospital;
     ""Minister of Health"" means
     (a) in the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island, the Minister of Health,
     (a.1 ) in the Province of Alberta, the Minister of Hospitals and Medical Care,

(b) in the Province of British Columbia, the Minister of Health Services and Hospital Insurance,
     (c) in the Provinces of Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan, the Minister of Public Health, and
     (d) in the Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories, the Minister of National Health and Welfare;
     ""qualified medical practitioner"" means a person entitled to engage in the practice of medicine under the laws of the province in which the hospital referred to in subsection (4) is situated;


page 85


     ""therapeutic abortion committee"" for any hospital means a committee, comprised of not less than three members each of whom is a qualified medical practitioner, appointed by the board of that hospital for the purpose of considering and determining questions relating to terminations of pregnancy within that hospital.
     (7) Nothing in subsection (4) shall be construed as making unnecessary the obtaining of any authorization or consent that is or may be required, otherwise than under this Act, before any means are used for the purpose of carrying out an intention to procure the miscarriage of a female person.
     Subsection (1) defines the indictable offence committed when a person uses any means for the purpose of carrying out his or her intention of procuring the miscarriage of a female person. Subsection (2) states that a pregnant woman who uses any means or permits any means to be used for the purpose of procuring her own miscarriage is guilty of an indictable offence with a lesser maximum penalty. Subsection (3) defines the expression ""means"" for s. 251 .
     Subsection (4), when read in conjunction with subss. (5), (6) and (7), outlines the circumstances in which an abortion can be lawfully performed. For the purposes of this appeal in which the existence of a constitutional right of access to abortion and the extent of that right is in issue, it is of special importance to understand the circumstances in which Parliament decriminalized abortion and thereby rendered it available without criminal sanction under ordinary law. Indeed, before the advent of the Charter , Parliament recognized that the interest in the life or health of the pregnant woman takes precedence over the interest in prohibiting abortions, including the interest of the state in the protection of the foetus, when the continuation of the pregnancy would or would be likely to endanger the pregnant woman's life or health. Access to lawful abortion under the Criminal Code , albeit in limited circumstances, exists independently of any right which may or may not be founded upon the Charter .
     As its opening words make plain, subs. (4) is an exculpatory provision: subss. (1) and (2), which  


page 86

indicate when conduct related to procuring a miscarriage is an indictable offence, ""do not apply"" when the terms of subs. (4) are respected. Until section 18 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69, S.C. 1968-69, c. 38, added subss. (4), (5), (6) and (7), there was no statutory exception to the crime of abortion. In the case at bar, the Ontario Court of Appeal (1985), 52 O.R. (2d) 353, explained the historical significance of the adoption in 1969 of these exculpatory provisions in the following terms, at p. 366:
     By defining criminal conduct more narrowly, these amendments reflected the contemporary view that abortion is not always socially undesirable behaviour.
     Access to abortion without risk of criminal penalty under the Criminal Code  is expressed by Parliament in subss. (4), (5), (6) and (7) of s. 251  as relieving provisions in respect of the indictable offences defined at s. 251(1)  and (2) . According to Laskin C.J. (dissenting) in Morgentaler v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 616 [hereinafter ""Morgentaler (1975)""], these relieving provisions ""simply permit a person to make conduct lawful which would otherwise be unlawful"" (at p. 631). In the same case, Pigeon J. said that in 1969 ""an explicit and specific definition was made of the circumstances under which an abortion could lawfully be performed"" (at p. 660).
     What is important, for our purposes, in considering subs. (4) is not, of course, the name we give to the exculpatory rule but the rule itself: Parliament has recognized that circumstances exist in which an abortion can be procured lawfully. The Court of Appeal observed, supra, at p. 378:
     A woman's only right to an abortion at the time the Charter  came into force would accordingly appear to be that given to her by s-s. (4) of s. 251 .
     Given that it appears in a criminal law statute, s. 251(4)  cannot be said to create a ""right"", much less a constitutional right, but it does represent an exception decreed by Parliament pursuant to what the Court of Appeal aptly called ""the  


page 87

contemporary view that abortion is not always socially undesirable behaviour"". Examining the content of the rule by which Parliament decriminalizes abortion is the most appropriate first step in considering the validity of s. 251  as against the constitutional right to abortion alleged by the appellants in argument.
     By enacting subss. (4), (5), (6) and (7) of s. 251  in 1969, Parliament endeavoured to decriminalize abortion in one circumstance, described in substantive terms in s. 251(4) (c): when the continuation of the pregnancy of the woman would or would be likely to endanger her life or health. This is the crux of the exception. This is the circumstance in which Parliament decided to allow women to procure a miscarriage without criminal sanction either for themselves or for their doctors. Laskin C.J. referred to this ""would or would be likely to endanger her life or health"" element in s. 251(4) (c) as the ""standard in s. 251(4) "" in Morgentaler (1975), supra, at p. 629.
     The remaining provisions of subss. (4), (5), (6) and (7) of s. 251  are designed to ascertain whether the standard has been met in a given case. To employ the expression of the Attorney General of Canada who intervened in this case in defence of s. 251 , these provisions were designed, in part, ""to allow relief from criminal sanction where there is a reliable, independent and medically sound judgment that the life or health of the mother would be or would likely be endangered...."" Section 251(4) (a) requires, for example, that a therapeutic abortion committee give its opinion in writing that the standard has been met. The committee is comprised of not less than three qualified medical practitioners appointed by the board of the hospital where the treatment would take place. The qualified medical practitioner who would perform the abortion may not be a member of a therapeutic abortion committee for any hospital. The opinion must be that of the majority of the members of the committee and must be made by certificate in writing and given to the practitioner who,  


page 88

according to s. 251(4) (a), must be in ""good faith"" and, consequently, have no reason to believe that the standard in s. 251(4) (c) has not been met. The Minister of Health of the province in which the certificate was issued may by order require the therapeutic abortion committee to furnish him with a copy of the certificate. Other aspects of s. 251(4)  are designed to ensure the safety of the abortion itself after the standard has been met and after the certificate to this effect has been issued enabling the woman to have a lawful abortion. These include the requirements that the practitioner be properly qualified and that the abortion be carried out in an accredited or approved hospital.
     Overall, the procedure set forth at s. 251(4)  is in place to ensure that the standard of the exception -- that the continuation of the pregnancy would or would be likely to endanger the pregnant woman's health -- is met before Parliament will allow an abortion to be performed without punishment. Parliament will protect the life and health of the pregnant woman by allowing her access to an abortion when it has been established, through the means selected by Parliament, that her life or health would or would likely be in danger if her pregnancy continued. The other provisions in s. 251(4) , though necessary for an abortion to be lawful, were enacted to ensure that the standard was met and that, once met, the lawful abortion would be performed safely. These other rules are a means to an end and not an end unto themselves. As a whole, subss. (4), (5), (6) and (7) of s. 251  seek to make therapeutic abortions lawful and available but also to ensure that the excuse of therapy will not be abused and that lawful abortions be safe.
     That abortions are recognized as lawful by Parliament based on a specific standard under its ordinary laws is important, I think, to a proper understanding of the existence of a right of access to abortion founded on rights guaranteed by s. 7  of the Charter . The constitutional right does not have its source in the Criminal Code , but, in my view, the content of the standard in s. 251(4)  that Parliament recognized in the Criminal Law  


page 89

Amendment Act, 1968-69 was for all intents and purposes entrenched at least as a minimum in 1982 when a distinct right in s. 7  became part of Canadian constitutional law.
     II -- The Right to Security of the Person in s. 7  of the Charter 
     Section 7  of the Charter  provides:
     7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.
     I share the view first expressed by Wilson J. in Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177, at p. 205, and confirmed by Lamer J. in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at p. 500, that ""it is incumbent upon this Court to give meaning to each of the elements, life, liberty and security of the person, which make up the `right' contained in s. 7 ."" The full ambit of this constitutionally protected right will only be revealed over time. Consequently, the minimum content which I attribute to s. 7  does not preclude, or for that matter assure, the finding of a wider constitutional right when the courts will be faced with this or other issues in other contexts. As we shall see, the content of the ""security of the person"" element of the s. 7  right is sufficient in itself to invalidate s. 251  of the Criminal Code  and consequently dispose of the appeal.
     In discussing the content of the right protected by s. 7  of the Charter  in the case at bar, the Ontario Court of Appeal wrote, at pp. 377-78, that ""it would place too narrow an interpretation on s. 7  to limit it to protection against arbitrary arrest and detention"". It will be seen from what follows that I agree with this view. Indeed the natural meaning of ""life, liberty and security of the person"" belies this limited view of the scope of s. 7 . As Estey J. observed in Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 357, at p. 377, examining the ""Legal Rights"" heading which introduces ss. 7  to 14  of the Charter  is at best one step in the constitutional interpretation process and is not necessarily of controlling importance. I  


page 90

am mindful, however, that it is in the criminal law context that ""security of the person"" and the alleged violation of s. 7  arise in this case. Enjoying ""security of the person"" free from criminal sanction is central to understanding the violation of the Charter  right which I describe herein. It is not necessary to decide whether s. 7  would apply in other circumstances.
     A pregnant woman's person cannot be said to be secure if, when her life or health is in danger, she is faced with a rule of criminal law which precludes her from obtaining effective and timely medical treatment.
     Generally speaking, the constitutional right to security of the person must include some protection from state interference when a person's life or health is in danger. The Charter  does not, needless to say, protect men and women from even the most serious misfortunes of nature. Section 7  cannot be invoked simply because a person's life or health is in danger. The state can obviously not be said to have violated, for example, a pregnant woman's security of the person simply on the basis that her pregnancy in and of itself represents a danger to her life or health. There must be state intervention for ""security of the person"" in s. 7  to be violated.
     If a rule of criminal law precludes a person from obtaining appropriate medical treatment when his or her life or health is in danger, then the state has intervened and this intervention constitutes a violation of that man's or that woman's security of the person. ""Security of the person"" must include a right of access to medical treatment for a condition representing a danger to life or health without fear of criminal sanction. If an act of Parliament forces a person whose life or health is in danger to choose between, on the one hand, the commission of a crime to obtain effective and timely medical treatment and, on the other hand, inadequate treatment or no treatment at all, the right to security of the person has been violated.


page 91


     This interpretation of s. 7  of the Charter  is sufficient to measure the content of s. 251  of the Criminal Code  against that of the Charter  in order to dispose of this appeal. While I agree with McIntyre J. that a breach of a right to security must be ""based upon an infringement of some interest which would be of such nature and such importance as to warrant constitutional protection"", I am of the view that the protection of life or health is an interest of sufficient importance in this regard. Under the Criminal Code , the only way in which a pregnant woman can legally secure an abortion when the continuation of the pregnancy would or would be likely to endanger her life or health is to comply with the procedure set forth in s. 251(4) . Where the continued pregnancy does constitute a danger to life or health, the pregnant woman faces a choice: (1) she can endeavour to follow the s. 251(4)  procedure, which, as we shall see, creates an additional medical risk given its inherent delays and the possibility that the danger will not be recognized by the state-imposed therapeutic abortion committee; or (2) she can secure medical treatment without respecting s. 251(4)  and subject herself to criminal sanction under s. 251(2) .
     III -- Delays Caused by s. 251  Procedure in Violation of Security of the Person
     This chapter requires a review of the evidence, part of which is to be found in two reports, the Report of the Committee on the Operation of the Abortion Law (the ""Badgley Report""), and the Report on Therapeutic Abortion Services in Ontario (the ""Powell Report"").
     The Badgley Report (1977) was written by a committee appointed by the Privy Council with a mandate to conduct a study to determine whether the procedure provided in the Criminal Code  for obtaining therapeutic abortions is operating equitably across Canada and to make findings on the operation of this law rather than recommendations on the underlying policy: Badgley Report, at p. 27.
     The Powell Report (1987) is a study commissioned by the Ministry of Health with terms of  


page 92

reference limited to a review of access to therapeutic abortion services in Ontario. Like those for the Badgley Report, these terms did not include the mandate for an evaluation of the underlying policy of the Criminal Code : Powell Report, Appendix 1.
     I propose to consider first the delays caused by the s. 251  procedure and then the consequences of the delays.
     1. Delays Caused by the s. 251  Procedure
     The evidence reveals that the actual workings of s. 251(4)  are the source of certain delays which create an additional medical risk for many pregnant women whose medical condition already meets the standard of s. 251(4) (c). Stated simply, when pregnant women suffer from a condition which represents a danger to their life or health, their efforts to conform to the procedure set forth for obtaining lawful abortions in the Criminal Code  often create an additional risk to their health. They may have to choose between bearing the burden of these risks by accepting delayed medical treatment, and committing a crime by seeking timely medical treatment outside s. 251(4) . Given that the procedure in s. 251(4)  is the source of this additional risk, it constitutes a violation of the pregnant woman's security of the person. I shall first endeavour to show that these delays have their origin in s. 251 . I will then cite evidence that these procedural delays create an additional risk to the health of pregnant women.
     While only administrative inefficiencies that are caused by the rules in s. 251  are relevant to the evaluation of the constitutionality of the legislation under s. 7  of the Charter , the evidence which relates to the availability of therapeutic abortions under the Criminal Code  reveals three sorts of delay, all of which can be traced to the requirements of s. 251  itself: (1) the absence of hospitals with therapeutic abortion committees in many parts of Canada; (2) the quotas which some hospitals with committees impose on the number of  


page 93

therapeutic abortions which they perform and (3) the committee requirement itself each create delays for pregnant women who seek timely and effective medical treatment.
     (1) Lack of Hospitals with Therapeutic Abortion Committees
     Hospitals with therapeutic abortion committees are completely lacking in many parts of Canada, forcing women to go elsewhere and suffer delays in order to gain access to hospitals in which they may obtain therapeutic abortions free from criminal sanction. The requirements which hospitals must meet under s. 251  are responsible for this absence of eligible hospitals. Often, the absence of hospitals can be traced to the prerequisites which hospitals must meet under s. 251(6). In other cases, the absence is caused by the refusal of certain hospital boards to appoint committees in hospitals which would otherwise qualify under the law, as is their prerogative under s. 251(6). I shall consider each of these in turn.
     The effect of certain definitions in s. 251(6), when read in conjunction with s. 251(4) , is to cause an absence of hospitals in which therapeutic abortions can legally be performed. A ""therapeutic abortion committee"" for any hospital means, according to s. 251(6), a committee comprised of not less than three physicians from which the physician who performs the abortion is excluded under s. 251(4) . As the Chief Justice observed, the combined effect of these two provisions is to require at least four physicians at the hospital so that the therapeutic abortion can be lawfully authorized and performed. The four-physician requirement obviously precludes therapeutic abortions from being performed in hospitals where four doctors are not available.
     Moreover, the requirement in s. 251(4)  that lawful abortions can only be performed in ""accredited"" or ""approved"" hospitals also has the effect of  


page 94

contributing to the absence of hospitals, in some parts of Canada, in which lawful abortions are available. Section 251(6) defines ""accredited hospital"" as a hospital accredited by the Canadian Council on Hospital Accreditation in which diagnostic services and medical, surgical and obstetrical treatment are provided. Not only are some hospitals unable to qualify because they do not provide all these services, but some hospitals also fail to meet the Council's accreditation requirements.
     Alternatively, therapeutic abortions may be performed in hospitals ""approved"" by the Ministers of Health in the province, and standards to be met for approval vary considerably from province to province. The Badgley Report, at pp. 91 et seq., noted this variation in 1977. In Newfoundland, for example, the Department of Health guidelines required hospitals seeking approval to establish therapeutic abortion committees to have a minimum of six members of the medical staff willing to co-operate with or recognize the existence of a therapeutic abortion committee, the presence of a gynaecologist on the medical staff, and 100 beds or more in the hospital, even though many abortions are done on an out-patient basis. Thus, of 46 public general hospitals in the province in 1976, 35 were excluded by these provincial criteria, leaving only 11 hospitals qualified to establish therapeutic abortion committees, with no obligation to do so. In Saskatchewan, where provincial regulations included a requirement of a rated bed capacity of 50 beds or more, 110 of 133 general hospitals were ineligible to establish a therapeutic abortion committee. In Ontario, where the provincial regulations included a requirement of 10 or more members on a hospital's active medical staff, 51 of 205 general hospitals were ineligible to establish committees. The Criminal Code , under the ""approved"" hospital requirement, not only allows for an unequal distribution of hospitals across Canada, but also permits provincial authorities to set standards which appear at times largely irrelevant to the performance of therapeutic abortions.


page 95


     Thus, the requirements of s. 251  seriously limit the number of hospitals which are eligible to perform lawful abortions, causing an absence or a serious lack of therapeutic abortion facilities in many parts of the country. The conclusions of the Badgley Report are startling (at p. 105):
     Of the total of 1,348 non-military hospitals in Canada in 1976, 789 hospitals, or 58.5 percent, were ineligible in terms of their major treatment functions, the size of their medial staff, or their type of facility to establish therapeutic abortion committees.
     The rules in s. 251(4)  limiting the number of eligible hospitals means that a significant proportion of Canada's population is not served by hospitals in which therapeutic abortions can lawfully be performed. The Badgley Report, at p. 109, concluded in 1977 that 39.3 per cent of the total female population of Canada was not served by eligible hospitals. As we have already seen, the absence of eligible hospitals in some parts of Canada compels many pregnant women to leave their own communities to seek medical treatment in a place where an eligible hospital is available to admit them as patients. A pregnant woman in these circumstances will inevitably incur a delay in obtaining a therapeutic abortion.
     The lack of hospitals with therapeutic abortion committees is made more serious by the refusal of certain hospital boards to appoint therapeutic abortion committees in hospitals which would otherwise qualify under the Criminal Code . Given that therapeutic abortions can only be performed in eligible hospitals and that the committee certifying the abortion must come from that hospital, this effectively contributes to the inaccessibility of the treatment. Nothing in the Criminal Code  obliges the board of an eligible hospital to appoint therapeutic abortion committees. Indeed, a board is entitled to refuse to appoint a therapeutic abortion committee in a hospital that would otherwise qualify to perform abortions and boards often do so in Canada. Given that the decision to appoint a committee is, in part, one of conscience and, in  


page 96

some cases, one which affects religious beliefs, a law cannot force a board to appoint a committee any more than it could force a physician to perform an abortion. The defect in the law is not that it does not force boards to appoint committees, but that it grants exclusive authority to those boards to make such appointments.
     In ""Abortion and the Just Society"" (1970), 5 R.J.T. 27, at p. 36, lawyer Natalie Fochs Isaacs correctly anticipated the effect of the exclusive authority of hospital boards in establishing committees:
     S. 237 [now s. 251 ] sets out the requirement of the certification of therapeutic abortion by a therapeutic abortion committee prior to its performance. But the section does not require any hospital to set up such a committee. Given the undesirability of forcing any hospital to do so, the restriction of legal abortions to this type of preliminary certification fails nevertheless to provide for alternative methods of prior medical consultation among those staff members of any hospital opposed to the creation of the committee required, who themselves approve of therapeutic abortions. The new legislation in this manner also places the prospective petitioner for the operation at the mercy of the institutional policy of what may be the only hospital available in her community. [Footnotes omitted.]
     The Badgley Report, at p. 93, again documented the reduction of the number of hospitals with therapeutic abortion committees due to the refusal of boards of hospitals which would otherwise qualify under the law to appoint committees. In Newfoundland, 6 of the 11 hospitals which were otherwise qualified to perform therapeutic abortions did in fact appoint committees so that only 6 of a total of 46 general hospitals were eligible to perform therapeutic abortions under the Criminal Code . In Quebec, 31 of 128 general hospitals appointed therapeutic abortion committees. In Saskatchewan, 10 of 133 general hospitals appointed committees. In Manitoba, 8 of 78 general hospitals appointed committees. Overall, the Badgley Report, supra, at p. 105, concluded in the following terms:


page 97


     In terms of all civilian hospitals (1,348) in Canada in 1976, 20.1 percent had established a therapeutic abortion committee. If only those general hospitals which met hospital practices and provincial requirements and were not exempt in terms of their special treatment facilities are considered, then of these 559 hospitals, 271 hospitals, or 48.5 percent, had established therapeutic abortion committees, while 288 hospitals, or 51.5 percent, did not have these committees.
     According to the Powell Report, a comparable fraction of hospitals had established therapeutic abortion committees in Ontario: ""out of 176 accredited acute care hospitals, 95 (54%) had therapeutic abortion committees"" (at p. 24). The figures reported by the Badgley Committee in 1977 were confirmed in a recent Statistics Canada report according to which the total number of hospitals with therapeutic abortion committees fell across the country from 271 in 1976 to 250 in 1985 (Therapeutic abortions, 1985 (1986), at p. 12).
     For the purposes of the case at bar, it is important to reiterate that the absence of hospitals with therapeutic abortion committees in many parts of Canada is caused by the following requirements of the law:
     (a) that a total of four physicians in the hospital must participate in the authorization and performance of the therapeutic abortion;
     (b) that the hospital must be ""approved"" or ""accredited""; and
     (c) that only the board of the hospital is entitled to appoint a therapeutic abortion committee.
     Finally, it is worth noting that 18 per cent of the hospitals that did have therapeutic abortion committees in 1984 performed no therapeutic abortions (Therapeutic abortions, 1985, supra, at p. 38). Dr. Augustin Roy, the President of the Corporation professionnelle des médecins du Québec, testified at trial that of the 30 hospitals with therapeutic abortion committees in Quebec, ""only about fourteen or fifteen of these hospitals are operational, because many of them, say half of  


page 98

them, have a committee but they don't do any abortions. It is a committee on paper.""
     A hospital with a dormant committee is no more useful to a pregnant woman seeking a therapeutic abortion than a hospital without a committee or no hospital at all. The delay suffered by a pregnant woman because her local hospital has a dormant committee is perhaps more the result of internal hospital policy than of s. 251  of the Criminal Code , but s. 251  is at least indirectly the cause of the delay in requiring an opinion from the therapeutic abortion committee of that hospital before a lawful abortion can be performed there.
     (2) Delays Caused by Quotas
     Delays result not only from the absence or inactivity of therapeutic abortion committees. The evidence discloses that some hospitals with committees impose quotas on the number of therapeutic abortions which they perform while others place quotas on patients depending on their place of residence. The evidence at trial confirmed that these quotas, initially observed in the Badgley Report, at pp. 258 et seq., have been retained in many Canadian hospitals and that they often delay timely medical treatment for pregnant women seeking therapeutic abortions. It is true, of course, that these quotas are set by internal hospital policy and not by the terms of the law itself. It is also true that quotas may be necessary given hospitals' limited resources and the significant demands placed on those resources by pregnant women seeking abortions, some of whom may not qualify for therapeutic abortions in respect of the standard of s. 251(4) . There is evidence, however, of quotas in absolute numbers of abortions performed and quotas based on the place of residence which can affect women who otherwise qualify for lawful abortions under s. 251(4) (c). Indeed the Badgley Committee reported in 1977, at p. 259, that:

     Two out of five hospitals (38.2 per cent) considered only applications from women who were considered to reside with the hospital's usual service catchment area. Residential requirements and patient quotas were more often adopted in the Maritimes (43.8 per cent) and Quebec (66.7 per cent) than among hospitals elsewhere where about a third followed this practice. Where the proportion of the hospitals with committees having these residency or quota requirements was higher in a province or a region, there were proportionately more women who went to the United States to obtain induced abortions.
     These quotas are inevitable given that s. 251  requires that therapeutic abortions be performed only in eligible hospitals and that there is a lack of hospitals with committees in some parts of the country. The quotas cannot, therefore, be said to reflect simple administrative or budgetary constraints. In this respect, the s. 251  procedure is again the source of delays in medical treatment.
     (3) Delays Caused by the Committee Requirement
     The committee requirement itself contributes to a delay in securing treatment. The law requires the therapeutic abortion committee to certify that the standard of s. 251(4)  has been met before a therapeutic abortion can proceed lawfully. As I shall endeavour to explain in my consideration of s. 251  and the principles of fundamental justice, I believe that the state interest in the protection of the foetus justifies the requirement that the standard of s. 251(4)  be ascertained by independent medical opinion. This being the case, some delay will always be incurred whatever system is put in place to ensure that the standard has been met. However, at this stage of my analysis, I seek only to establish that a delay has in fact been caused by the present requirements of the Criminal Code .
     The time needed to convene the committee in the hospital, for the pregnant woman's file to come before the committee, for her application to be evaluated by whatever means the committee may choose and for the certificate to be issued to the  


page 100

qualified medical practitioner together create some delay for obtaining treatment. The Badgley Report, at p. 146, identified an average interval of 8.0 weeks until the induced abortion operation was done after the pregnant woman's initial visit to her physician. Some of this delay is attributable to the absence of committees and hospital quotas which I have outlined above. It is difficult to isolate with precision the fraction of the delay attributable to the committee requirement taken by itself. It is relevant as one part of the overall delay which pregnant women must endure to obtain a therapeutic abortion.
     In spite of evidence that the overall delay has been reduced, as will be seen shortly, the committee requirement continues to add to the delay. In 1987, the Powell Report, at p. 27, identified as one problem the number of committee members who must certify that the s. 251(4)  standard has been met:
     The number of members on the TAC [therapeutic abortion committee] ranges from three to five although up to seven members sit on some committees. When five or seven members have been appointed and no quorum is stated, a majority of the committee (three to five) must be present and three must approve each abortion. This has caused problems in several of the hospitals contacted, where it was not possible for an adequate number of members to be present and the meeting had to be rescheduled. Thus precious time was lost and the abortion delayed to a more advanced gestational age.
     Furthermore, the delays caused by the committee requirements necessarily impact upon the pregnant woman who seeks to become a patient of the hospital for which the committee has been appointed. Section 251(4)  states in part that it is ""the therapeutic abortion committee for that accredited or approved hospital"" which must issue the certificate [emphasis added]. This precludes a committee from one hospital from authorizing abortions which take place at other hospitals. Eliminating such a requirement would have the effect of shortening the delays without forcing reluctant hospital boards or hospital staff to participate.

2. Consequences of the Delays
     The delays which a pregnant woman may have to suffer as a result of the requirements of s. 251(4)  must undermine the security of her person in order that there be a violation of this element of s. 7  of the Charter . As I said earlier, s. 7  cannot be invoked simply because a woman's pregnancy amounts to a medically dangerous condition. If, however, the delays occasioned by s. 251(4)  of the Criminal Code  result in an additional danger to the pregnant woman's health, then the state has intervened and this intervention constitutes a violation of that woman's security of the person. By creating this additional risk, s. 251  prevents access to effective and timely medical treatment for the continued pregnancy which would or would be likely to endanger her life or health. If an effective and timely therapeutic abortion may only be obtained by committing a crime, then s. 251  violates the pregnant woman's right to security of the person.
     The evidence reveals that the delays caused by s. 251(4)  result in at least three broad types of additional medical risks. The risk of post-operative complications increases with delay. Secondly, there is a risk that the pregnant woman require a more dangerous means of procuring a miscarriage because of the delay. Finally, since a pregnant woman knows her life or health is in danger, the delay created by the s. 251(4)  procedure may result in an additional psychological trauma. I shall explain each of the additional risks in turn.
     The Chief Justice outlined the different techniques employed to perform abortions at different stages of pregnancy and the increasing risk attached to each method as gestational age advances. As he also noted, the evidence showed that within the periods appropriate to each method of abortion, the earlier the abortion was performed, the lower the risk of complication. Evidence introduced at trial confirms findings in the Badgley Report, at pp. 308 et seq., and the Powell Report, at p. 23, that the earlier an abortion is performed, the less chance a woman has of  


page 102

experiencing a post-operative complication, whatever abortion technique is used. The respondent agrees with this proposition but cites the low complication rate across Canada and the negligible mortality rate reported since 1974 as evidence that abortion under the current system is very safe. According to Therapeutic abortions, 1985, supra, at p. 20, no Canadian women have died as a result of therapeutic abortion since 1979. One such death took place in 1974 and another in 1979.
     It should be noted, however, that reported complication rates for any given abortion technique are generally limited to certain post-operative physical complications and do not include data on psychological complications inherent to those techniques. Furthermore, the psychological trauma that women suffer before the operation is not reflected in reported figures. This is equally true for any physical complications associated with the pregnant woman's initially dangerous condition which may arise during the delay before the therapeutic abortion.
     However low the post-operative complication rate may appear, it increases as gestational age advances. In other words, with each passing week of pregnancy, even in the very early stages, the risk to health that an abortion represents increases. Therapeutic abortions, 1982 confirms this. The complication rate for abortions performed under nine weeks was 0.7 per cent. This increased to 1.0 per cent in the 9 to 12 week gestation period. A complication rate of 8.5 per cent was reported for the 13 to 16 week gestation period. The complication rate for the 17 to 20 week gestation period was higher still, reported as 22 per cent (Therapeutic abortions, 1982 (1984), at p. 111). Ontario statistics cited in the Powell Report confirm these national figures for that province. Data from 1976, 1981 and 1984 confirm the relation between abortion complications and gestational age in Ontario. In terms of absolute numbers, there were twice as many reported complications for women with gestational age 13 weeks and above compared to gestational age under 13 weeks. The rate expressed  


page 103

as a percentage of total reported therapeutic abortions performed (""per 100 gestational age specific abortions"") was ten times higher for the group of women with gestational age 13 weeks and above (see Powell Report, at p. 23 and Table 4).
     The procedure set forth in s. 251(4)  of the Criminal Code  often causes, as we have seen, significant delays in obtaining therapeutic abortions. Delay increases the risk of post-operative complications. Section 251(4)  thereby violates a pregnant woman's security of the person.
     As I have already observed, the evidence indicates that the different techniques employed to perform abortions in Canada at different stages of pregnancy progressively increase risks to the woman. Expert testimony established that the suction dilation and curettage method generally used in the first twelve weeks is the safest technique. The dilation and evacuation method used from the thirteenth to the sixteenth week is relatively more dangerous. From the sixteenth week of pregnancy, an even more dangerous instillation method may be used. This method involves the introduction of prostaglandin, urea or saline solution which causes the woman to go into labour, giving birth to a foetus which is usually dead but not invariably so. Although the number of abortions done by the instillation technique amounts to only 4.5 per cent of the total number of therapeutic abortions performed in Canada, saline, urea or prostaglandin instillation is nevertheless used for 85.6 per cent of therapeutic abortions for women at least 16 weeks pregnant (Therapeutic abortions, 1985, supra, at pp. 18-19). It has been shown that the complication rate increases dramatically with the use of the instillation procedure (ibid., at p. 50). In addition, psychological trauma resulting from induced labour and the birth of the foetus is a very real consideration which is not included in  


page 104

post- operative statistics. It is in the pregnant woman's utmost interest that the delay for obtaining a therapeutic abortion be as short as possible so that the risks associated with more dangerous abortion techniques can be avoided.
     Women are aware of the increased risk associated with the later stage abortion techniques. They are also aware of the more traumatic circumstances in which these techniques, particularly the instillation methods, are carried out. It is thus not only the risk of post-operative complications that increases progressively with each method. Women are aware of the increased risk well before the operation is performed. Experts testified at trial that awareness of the increased post-operative risk and of the added trauma associated with the later-stage methods create an increased psychological risk to health distinct from the increased physical risk. There is a world of difference, from the psychological point of view of the patient, between a reputedly safe technique of abortion performed under local anaesthetic requiring only a few hours in a hospital and an abortion procedure with a substantially higher complication rate performed under general anaesthetic requiring a longer period of hospitalization, and involving the trauma of induced labour and the delivery of a dead foetus. When the delays caused by s. 251(4)  require a woman to undergo a saline procedure abortion, for example, the psychological trauma associated with that procedure amounts to an additional risk to health attributable to the Criminal Code . More generally, the delay that a pregnant woman must endure before she receives treatment of any kind results in psychological trauma. To force a woman, under threat of criminal sanction, to wait for medical treatment when she knows that her pregnancy represents a danger to her life or health is a violation of her right to security of the person. As was stated in Collin v. Lussier, [1983] 1 F.C. 218, at p. 239 (later reversed on appeal,  


page 105

[1985] 1 F.C. 124, but cited with approval on this point by Wilson J. in Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, supra, at p. 208):
     . . . such detention, by increasing the applicant's anxiety as to his state of health, is likely to make his illness worse and, by depriving him of access to adequate medical care, it is in fact an impairment of the security of his person.
     The psychological trauma that a pregnant woman suffers as a result of the delay shows that the procedure established by the Criminal Code  violates the security of her person.
     I have observed three instances in which s. 251  of the Criminal Code  results in delays for women who qualify for therapeutic abortions in respect of the standard of s. 251(4) (c). This being said, the overall delay appears to have been reduced from the 8.0 weeks observed by the Badgley Committee in 1977. Evidence indicates that where a hospital with a committee is in place in a region, as in the case of Toronto, pregnant women can obtain therapeutic abortions within one to three weeks from their initial contact with a physician. Experts testified at trial that these delays are longer in some parts of the country, particularly in Quebec, but that overall delays have, on balance, been reduced. Furthermore, therapeutic abortion committees generally can speed up the certification process in an emergency situation, particularly when the pregnant woman's gestational age requires immediate medical attention. In spite of the reduction, however, these delays continue to result in an additional risk to the health of these women. The risk of post-operative complications increases with each passing week of delay. There is a heightened physical and psychological risk associated with later stage pregnancy techniques for abortion. Finally, psychological trauma increases with delay. The delays mean therefore that the state has intervened in such a manner as to create an additional risk to health, and  


page 106

consequently this intervention constitutes a violation of the woman's security of the person.
     IV -- The Principles of Fundamental Justice
     I turn now to a consideration of the manner in which pregnant women are deprived of their right to security of the person by s. 251 . Section 7  of the Charter  states that everyone has the right not to be deprived of security of the person except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. As I will endeavour to demonstrate, s. 251(4)  does not accord with the principles of fundamental justice.
     I am of the view, however, that certain elements of the procedure for obtaining a therapeutic abortion which counsel for the appellants argued could not be saved by the second part of s. 7  are in fact in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. The expression of the standard in s. 251(4) (c), and the requirement for some independent medical opinion to ascertain that the standard has been met as well as the consequential necessity of some period of delay to ascertain the standard are not in breach of s. 7  of the Charter .
     Counsel for the appellants argued that the expression of the standard in s. 251(4) (c) is so imprecise that it offends the principles of fundamental justice. He submits that pregnant women are arbitrarily deprived of their s. 7  right by reason of the different meanings that can be given to the word ""health"" in s. 251(4) (c) by therapeutic abortion committees.
     I agree with McIntyre J. and the Ontario Court of Appeal that the expression ""the continuation of the pregnancy of such female person would or would be likely to endanger her life or health"" found in s. 251(4) (c) does provide, as a matter of law, a sufficiently precise standard by which therapeutic abortion committees can determine when therapeutic abortions should be granted.
     As the Court of Appeal said, supra, at p. 388:


page 107


     In this case . . . from a reading of s. 251  with its exceptions, there is no difficulty in determining what is proscribed and what is permitted. It cannot be said that no sensible meaning can be given to the words of the section. Thus, it is for the courts to say what meaning the statute will bear.
     Laskin C.J. held in Morgentaler (1975), at p. 634, that s. 251(4) (c) was not so vague so as to constitute a violation of ""security of the person"" without due process of law under s. 1(a) of the Canadian Bill of Rights:
     It is enough to say that Parliament has fixed a manageable standard because it is addressed to a professional panel, the members of which would be expected to bring a practised judgment to the question whether ""the continuation of the pregnancy . . . would or would be likely to endanger . . . life or health."" Moreover, I am of the view that Parliament would assign such an exercise of judgment to a professional group without colliding with any imperatives called for by due process of law under s. 1  (a).
     I agree with Laskin C.J. that the standard is manageable because it is addressed to a panel of doctors exercising medical judgment on a medical question. This being the case, the standard must necessarily be flexible. Flexibility and vagueness are not synonymous. Parliament has set a medical standard to be determined over a limited range of circumstances. With the greatest of respect, I cannot agree with the view that the therapeutic abortion committee is a ""strange hybrid, part medical committee and part legal committee"" as the Chief Justice characterizes it (at p. 69). In section 251(4) Parliament has only given the committee the authority to make a medical determination regarding the pregnant woman's life or health. The committee is not called upon to evaluate the sufficiency of the state interest in the foetus as against the woman's health. This evaluation of the state interest is a question of law already decided by Parliament in its formulation of s. 251(4). Evidence has been submitted that many committees fail to apply the standard set by Parliament by requiring the consent of the pregnant woman's spouse, by refusing to authorize second abortions or by refusing all abortions to married women. In  


page 108

so far as these and other requirements fall outside s. 251(4)(c), they constitute an unfounded interpretation of the plain terms of the Criminal Code . These patent excesses of authority do not, however, mean that the standard of s. 251  is vague.
     The wording of s. 251(4)(c) limits the authority of the committee. The word ""health"" is not vague but plainly refers to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman. I note with interest the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in United States v. Vuitch, 402 U.S. 62 (1971), in which a District of Columbia statute outlawing abortions except when they were ""necessary for the preservation of the mother's life or health"" was at issue. It was argued that the word ""health"" was so imprecise and had so uncertain a meaning that the statute offended the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. Mindful of the differences between the Due Process Clause and the principles of fundamental justice in s. 7  of the Charter , I nevertheless believe the following extract, at p. 72, of the majority opinion delivered by Black J. to be instructive:
     . . . the general usage and modern understanding of the word ""health"" . . . includes psychological as well as physical well-being. Indeed Webster's Dictionary, in accord with that common usage, properly defines health as the ""[s]tate of being ... sound in body [or] mind."" Viewed in this light, the term ""health"" presents no problem of vagueness. Indeed, whether a particular operation is necessary for a patient's physical or mental health is a judgment that physicians are obviously called upon to make routinely whenever surgery is considered.
     The standard is further circumscribed by the word ""endanger"". Not only must the continuation of the pregnancy affect the woman's life or health, it must endanger life or health, so that a committee that authorizes an abortion when this element is not present or fails to authorize it when it is present exceeds its authority. Finally, the expression ""would or would be likely"" eliminates any requirement that the danger to life or health be  


page 109

certain or immediate at the time the certificate is issued.
     The presence of the exculpatory provision in the Criminal Code  and the wording of the standard itself point to the parameters of s. 251(4) . The required standard of threat to life or health must necessarily be lesser than that required under the common law defence of necessity, otherwise s. 251(4)  would be superfluous. It is proper to infer, on the other hand, that s. 251(4)  must be interpreted as relating solely to therapeutic grounds since only qualified medical practitioners are entitled to evaluate the threat to life or health.
     Not only is the standard expressed in s. 251(4)(c) sufficiently precise to permit therapeutic abortion committees to determine when therapeu- tic abortions should be granted, but the crime of procuring a miscarriage is expressed with sufficient clarity for those subject to its terms so as not to offend the principles of fundamental justice. In this respect, counsel for the respondent correctly observed in his written argument that "". . . s. 251  presents no degree of uncertainty or vagueness as to potential criminal liability: anyone charged with an offence would know whether prohibited conduct was being undertaken and whether an exemption certificate had been received. Equally, any official entrusted with enforcing this section would know whether an offence had been committed."" Police officers are not called upon by the section to define ""health"" but, in respect of the medical justification for a therapeutic abortion, they must ensure that a certificate in writing has been duly issued.
     Just as the expression of the standard in s. 251(4)(c) does not offend the principles of fundamental justice, the requirement that an independent medical opinion be obtained for a therapeutic abortion to be lawful also cannot be said to constitute a violation of these principles when considered in the context of pregnant women's right to security of the person.
     In R. v. Jones, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 284, at p. 304, La Forest J. explained that the legislator must be  


page 110

accorded a certain latitude to make choices regarding the type of administrative structure that will suit its needs unless the use of such structure is in itself ""so manifestly unfair, having regard to the decisions it is called upon to make [emphasis added], as to violate the principles of fundamental justice"". An administrative structure made up of unnecessary rules, which result in an additional risk to the health of pregnant women, is manifestly unfair and does not conform to the principles of fundamental justice. Section 251(4), taken as a whole, does not accord with the principles of fundamental justice in that certain of the procedural requirements of s. 251  create unnecessary delays. As will be seen, some of these requirements are manifestly unfair because they have no connection whatsoever with Parliament's objectives in establishing the administrative structure in s. 251(4). Although connected to Parliament's objectives, other rules in s. 251(4) are manifestly unfair because they are not necessary to assure that the objectives are met.
     As I noted in my analysis of s. 251(4), by requiring that a committee state that the medical standard has been met for the criminal sanction to be lifted, Parliament seeks to assure that there is a reliable, independent and medically sound opinion that the continuation of the pregnancy would or would be likely to endanger the woman's life or health. Whatever the failings of the current system, I believe that the purpose pursuant to which it was adopted does not offend the principles of fundamental justice. As I shall endeavour to explain, the current mechanism in the Criminal Code  does not accord with the principles of fundamental justice. This does not preclude, in my view, Parliament from adopting another system, free of the failings of s. 251(4) , in order to ascertain that the life or health of the pregnant woman is in danger, by way of a reliable, independent and medically sound opinion.
     Parliament is justified in requiring a reliable, independent and medically sound opinion in order to protect the state interest in the foetus. This is  


page 111

undoubtedly the objective of a rule which requires an independent verification of the practising physician's opinion that the life or health of the pregnant woman is in danger. It cannot be said to be simply a mechanism designed to protect the health of the pregnant woman. While this latter objective clearly explains the requirement that the practising physician be a ""qualified medical practitioner"" and that the abortion take place in a safe place, it cannot explain the necessary intercession of an in-hospital committee of three physicians from which is excluded the practising physician.
     While a second medical opinion is very often seen as necessary in medical circles when difficult questions as to a patient's life or health are at issue, the independent opinion called for by the Criminal Code  has a different purpose. Parliament requires this independent opinion because it is not only the woman's interest that is at stake in a decision to authorize an abortion. The Ontario Court of Appeal alluded to this at p. 378 when it stated that ""One cannot overlook the fact that the situation respecting a woman's right to control her own person becomes more complex when she becomes pregnant, and that some statutory control may be appropriate"". The presence of the foetus accounts for this complexity. By requiring an independent medical opinion that the pregnant woman's life or health is in fact endangered, Parliament seeks to ensure that, in any given case, only therapeutic reasons will justify the decision to abort. The amendments to the Criminal Code  in 1969 amounted to a recognition by Parliament, as I have said, that the interest in the life or health of the pregnant woman takes precedence over the interest of the state in the protection of the foetus when the continuation of the pregnancy would or would be likely to endanger the pregnant woman's life or health. Parliament decided that it was necessary to ascertain this from a medical point of view before the law would allow the interest of the pregnant woman to indeed take precedence over that of the foetus and permit an abortion to be performed without criminal sanction.


page 112


     I do not believe it to be unreasonable to seek independent medical confirmation of the threat to the woman's life or health when such an important and distinct interest hangs in the balance. I note with interest that in a number of foreign jurisdictions, laws which decriminalize abortions require an opinion as to the state of health of the woman independent from the opinion of her own physician. The Crown, in its book of authorities, cited the following statutes which included such a mechanism: United Kingdom, Abortion Act, 1967, 1967, c. 87, s. 1(1)(a); Australian Northern Territory, Criminal Law Consolidation Act and Ordinance, s. 79 A(3)(a); South Australia, Criminal Law Consolidation Act, 1935-1975, s. 82a(1)(a); Federal Republic of Germany, Criminal Code , as amended by the Fifteenth Criminal Law Amendment Act (1976), s. 219 ; Israel, Penal Law, 5737-1977 (as amended), s. 315 ; New Zealand, Crimes Act 1961, as amended by the Crimes Amendment Act 1977 and the Crimes Amendment Act 1978, s. 187A(4) ; Code pénal suisse, art. 120(1) . This said, the practising physician must, according to s. 251(4) (a), be in ""good faith"" and, consequently, have no reason to believe that the standard in s. 251(4) (c) has not been met. The practising physician is, however, properly excluded from the body giving the independent opinion. I believe that Parliament is justified in requiring what is no doubt an extraordinary medical practice in its regulation of the criminal law of abortion in accordance with the various interests at stake.
     The assertion that an independent medical opinion, distinct from that of the pregnant woman and her practising physician, does not offend the principles of fundamental justice would need to be reevaluated if a right of access to abortion is founded upon the right to ""liberty"" in s. 7  of the Charter . I am of the view that there would still be circumstances in which the state interest in the protection of the foetus would require an independent medical opinion as to the danger to the life or health of the pregnant woman. Assuming without deciding that a right of access to abortion can be founded upon the right to  


page 113

""liberty"", there would be a point in time at which the state interest in the foetus would become compel- ling. From this point in time, Parliament would be entitled to limit abortions to those required for therapeutic reasons and therefore require an independent opinion as to the health exception. The case law reveals a substantial difference of opinion as to the state interest in the protection of the foetus as against the pregnant woman's right to liberty. Wilson J., for example, in her discussion of s. 1  of the Charter  in the case at bar, notes the following, at p. 183:
     The precise point in the development of the foetus at which the state's interest in its protection becomes ""compelling"" I leave to the informed judgment of the legislature which is in a position to receive guidance on the subject from all the relevant disciplines. It seems to me, however, that it might fall somewhere in the second trimester.

This view as to when the state interest becomes compelling may be compared with that of O'Connor J. of the United States Supreme Court in her dissenting opinion in City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416 (1983), at pp. 460-61:
     In Roe [Roe v. Wade 410 U.S. 113 (1973)], the Court held that although the State had an important and legitimate interest in protecting potential life, that interest could not become compelling until the point at which the fetus was viable. The difficulty with this analysis is clear: potential life is no less potential in the first weeks of pregnancy than it is at viability or afterward. At any stage in pregnancy, there is the potential for human life. Although the Court refused to ""resolve the difficult question of when life begins,"" id., at 159, the Court chose the point of viability -- when the foetus is capable of life independent of its mother -- to permit the complete proscription of abortion. The choice of viability as the point at which state interest in potential life becomes compelling is no less arbitrary than choosing any point before viability or any point afterward. Accordingly, I believe that the State's interest in protecting potential human life exists throughout the pregnancy.
     As I indicated at the outset of my reasons, it is nevertheless possible to resolve this appeal without attempting to delineate the right to ""liberty"" in s.  


page 114

7 of the Charter . The violation of the right to ""security of the person"" and the relevant principles of fundamental justice are sufficient to invalidate s. 251  of the Criminal Code .
     Some delay is inevitable in connection with any system which purports to limit to therapeutic reasons the grounds upon which an abortion can be performed lawfully. Any statutory mechanism for ensuring an independent confirmation as to the state of the woman's life or health, adopted pursuant to the objective of assuring the protection of the foetus, will inevitably result in a delay which would exceed whatever delay would be encountered if an independent opinion was not required. Furthermore, rules promoting the safety of abortions designed to protect the interest of the pregnant woman will also cause some unavoidable delay. It is only in so far as the administrative structure creates delays which are unnecessary that the structure can be considered to violate the principles of fundamental justice. Indeed, an examination of the delays caused by certain of the procedural requirements in s. 251(4) reveals that they are unnecessary, given Parliament's objectives in establishing the administrative structure. I note parenthetically that it is not sufficient to argue that the structure would operate in a fair manner but for the applications from women who do not qualify in respect of the standard in s. 251(4)(c). A fair structure, put in place to decide between those women who qualify for a therapeutic abortion and those who do not, should be designed with a view to efficiently meeting the demands which it must necessarily serve.
     One such example of a rule which is unnecessary is the requirement in s. 251(4) that therapeu- tic abortions must take place in an eligible hospital to be lawful. I have observed that s. 251(4) directs that therapeutic abortions take place in accredited or approved hospitals, with at least four physicians, and that, because of the lack of such hospitals in many parts of Canada, this often causes delay for women seeking treatment. As I noted earlier, this requirement was plainly adopted to assure the safety of the abortion procedure  


page 115

generally, and particularly the safety of the pregnant woman, after the standard of s. 251(4) has been met and after the certificate to this effect has been issued enabling the woman to have a lawful abortion. The objective in respect of which the in- hospital rule was adopted is safety and not the state interest in the protection of the foetus. As the rule stands in s. 251(4), however, no exception is currently possible. The evidence discloses that there is no justification for the requirement that all therapeutic abortions take place in hospitals eligible under the Criminal Code . In this sense, the delays which result from the hospital requirement are unnecessary and, consequently, in this respect, the administrative structure for therapeutic abortions is manifestly unfair and offends the principles of fundamental justice.
     Experts testified at trial that the principal justification for the in-hospital rule is the problem of post-operative complications. There are of course instances in which the danger to life or health observed by the therapeutic abortion committee will constitute sufficient grounds for the procedure to take place in a hospital. There are other instances in which the circumstances of the procedure itself requires that it be performed in hospital, such as certain abortions performed at an advanced gestational age or cases in which the patient is particularly vulnerable to what might otherwise be a simple procedure.
     In many cases, however, there is no medical justification that the therapeutic abortion take place in a hospital. Experts testified at trial, that many first trimester therapeutic abortions may be safely performed in specialized clinics outside of hospitals because the possible complications can be handled, and in some cases better handled, by the facilities of a specialized clinic. The parties submitted statistics comparing complication rates for in-hospital abortions and those performed in non-hospital facilities. These statistics are of limited value for our purposes because, not surprisingly,  


page 116

the higher reported rates in hospitals are due in part to the fact that the more dangerous cases are treated in hospital. What is more revealing, however, are statistics which show that a high percentage of therapeutic abortions performed in Canada are performed on an out-patient basis:
     The average length of stay in hospitals per therapeutic abortion case was less than a day in 1985. This average includes 46,567 cases or 76.9 per cent of 60,518 therapeutic abortion cases for women, for whom the pregnancy terminations took place on an outpatient (day care) basis. The per cent of outpatient therapeutic abortions increased to 76.9% in 1985 from 59.7% in 1981 and 34.9% in 1975. [Therapeutic abortions, 1985, supra, at p. 20.]
     The substantial increase in the percentage of abortions performed on an out-patient basis since 1975 underscores the view that the in-hospital requirement, which may have been justified when it was first adopted, has become exorbitant. One suspects that the number of out-patient abortions would be even higher if the Criminal Code  did not prevent women in many parts of Canada from obtaining timely and effective treatment by requiring them to travel to places where eligible hospital facilities were available. Furthermore, these figures do not include out-patient abortions which may have qualified as therapeutic under the standard in s. 251(4) (c) which were performed on Canadian women in the United States and in clinics currently operating in Canada outside the s. 251(4)  exception. Citing the Canadian abortion law's in-hospital requirement as a legislative standard which is difficult to satisfy, Rebecca J. Cook and Bernard M. Dickens observe that ""Rigid statutory formulae may not improve . . . distribution of services but may obstruct appropriate response to health needs"": Abortion Laws in Commonwealth Countries (1979), at p. 28.

     In the Powell Report, several recommendations were made as to options for abortion service delivery in Ontario. In support of these recommendations, the Report included the following, at pp. 21 and 35:
     When many countries legalized abortion, hospitals were viewed as the appropriate providers of safe abortion services. Since then, studies have demonstrated that abortions can be performed safely in other types of facilities, (Tietze & Henshaw, 1986). The complication rate for all abortions performed in nonhospital facilities, is no higher than for those which take place in hospitals (Grimes et al., 1981).
     ...
     Hospitals are often hard pressed to find time in the busy operating room schedules to fit in abortion procedures. In most hospitals, abortions are not viewed as a priority for scheduling. Gynaecologists must fit abortions into their allotted time in operating rooms. Although abortions can be performed in minor procedure rooms with no jeopardy to the patient, this is an unusual practice.
     The presence of legislation in other jurisdictions permitting certain abortions to be performed outside of hospitals is especially revealing as to the safety of the procedure in those circumstances and of the necessity to provide alternative means given the limited resources of hospitals. In the Powell Report, it was observed, at p. 21, that:
     In a number of European countries, including the Netherlands, Poland and West Germany, approximately half of the abortions are performed in non-hospital facilities. In France in 1982, 53 percent of abortions were performed in 90 ""centres d'interruption volontaire de grossesse"" which were administered by hospitals but were in practice separate abortion clinics. The French government ordered all public hospitals that could not meet the demand for abortions to provide such clinics.
     Particularly striking is the United States experience in respect of the in-hospital rule. The Powell Report noted that 82 per cent of abortions performed in the United States in 1982 were done outside of hospitals (at p. 22). Experts confirmed  


page 118

this finding at trial. Dr. Christopher Tietze, a recognized expert on abortion, explained at trial that in 1981 all out-of-hospital abortion clinics in the United States performed abortions up to 10 weeks gestational age, 90 per cent of clinics performed abortions up to 12 weeks, 50 per cent of clinics up to 14 weeks and 20 per cent accepted patients up to 16 weeks. Although the legal basis upon which women assert a constitutional right of access to abortion is different in the United States than that which I find in the case at bar, the American experience as to the inappropriateness of a universal in-hospital requirement remains relevant.
     The Powell Report proposed a number of projects as alternatives to the in-hospital rule for therapeutic abortions. Each proposal is designed to be ""under the jurisdiction of a hospital board or several hospital boards with approval for abortion services provided through hospital therapeutic abortion committee mechanisms"" (at p. 37). One such proposal is for the establishment of comprehensive women's health care clinics which would provide first trimester abortions, referrals to hospitals for second trimester abortions and post-abortion counselling. Regional centres for therapeutic abortion clinics affiliated with but not necessarily located in a hospital are also proposed in the Report, which goes on to emphasize that first trimester ambulatory abortions are those most appropriate for a non-hospital setting.
     The Badgley Committee also made a series of proposals designed to reduce the number and type of complications associated with therapeutic abortions. These included a proposal, at p. 322, for ""concentrating the performance of the abortion procedure into specialized units with a full range of the required equipment and facilities and staffed by experienced and specially trained nurses and medical personnel"".


page 119


     Whatever the eventual solution may be, it is plain that the in-hospital requirement is not justified in all cases. Although the protection of health of the woman is the objective which the in-hospital rule is intended to serve, the requirement that all therapeutic abortions be performed in eligible hospitals is unnecessary to meet that objective in all cases. In this sense, the rule is manifestly unfair and offends the principles of fundamental justice. I appreciate that the precise nature of the administrative solution may be complicated by the constitutional division of powers between Parliament and the provinces. There is no doubt that Parliament could allow the criminal law exception to operate in all hospitals, for example, though the provinces retain the power to establish these hospitals under s. 92(7)  of the Constitution Act, 1867 . On the other hand, if Parliament decided to allow therapeutic abortions to be performed in provincially licensed clinics, it is possible that both Parliament and the provinces would be called upon to collaborate in the implementation of the plan.
     An objection can also be raised in respect of the requirement that the committee come from the accredited or approved hospital in which the abortion is to be performed. It is difficult to see a connection between this requirement and any of the practical purposes for which s. 251(4) was enacted. It cannot be said to have been adopted in order to promote the safety of therapeutic abortions or the safety of the pregnant woman. Nor is the rule designed to preserve the state interest in the foetus. The integrity of the independent medical opinion is no better served by a committee within the hospital than a committee from outside the hospital as long as the practising physician remains excluded in both circumstances as part of a proper state participation in the choice of the procedure necessary to secure an independent opinion.

In a recent unpublished paper entitled Options for Abortion Policy Reform: A Consultation Document (1986), at p. 74, the Fetal Status Working Group, (Edward W. Keyserlingk, Director), Protection of Life Project of the Law Reform  


page 120

Commission of Canada confirmed the view that the requirement that abortion committees be limited to hospitals is unnecessary:
     Restricting the existence of these committees to hospitals appears to be one of the reasons for delays and inequitable access. There appears to be no compelling medical reason why committees should not be attached to clinics which are equipped and licensed to provide this procedure.
     The Law Reform Commission's Working Group raises the possibility of regional abortion committees to replace the current rule (supra, at p. 76). The Powell Report proposals include a model whereby a central therapeutic abortion committee could serve several hospitals (supra, at p. 38).
     Whatever solution is finally retained, it is plain that the requirement that the therapeutic abortion committee come from the hospital in which the abortion will be performed serves no real purpose. The risk resulting from the delay caused by s. 251(4) in this respect is unnecessary. Consequently, this requirement violates the principles of fundamental justice.
     Other aspects of the committee requirement in s. 251(4) add to the manifest unfairness of the administrative structure. These include requirements which are at best only tenuously connected to the purpose of obtaining independent confirmation that the standard in s. 251(4)(c) has been met and which do not usefully contribute to the realization of that purpose. Hospital boards are entitled to appoint committees made up of three or more qualified medical practitioners. As I observed earlier, if more than three members are appointed, precious time can be lost when quorum cannot be established because members are absent. Whatever the number of members necessary to arrive at an independent appreciation of the state of the woman's life or health may in fact be, this number should be kept to a minimum to avoid unnecessary delays which, as I have explained, result in increased risk to women. Allowing a board to increase the number of members above a statutory  


page 121

minimum of three members does not add to the integrity of the independent opinion. This aspect of the current rule is unnecessary and, since it can result in increased risks, offends the principles of fundamental justice.
     Similarly, the exclusion of all physicians who practise therapeutic abortions from the committees is exorbitant. This rule was no doubt included in s. 251(4) to promote the independence of the therapeutic abortion committees' appreciation of the standard. As I have said, the exclusion of the practising physician, although it diverges from usual medical practice, is appropriate in the criminal context to ensure the independent opinion with respect to the life or health of that physician's patient. The exclusion of all physicians who perform therapeutic abortions from committees, even when they have no connection with the patient in question, is not only unnecessary but potentially counterproductive. There are no reasonable grounds to suspect bias from a physician who has no connection with the patient simply because, in the course of his or her medical practice, he or she performs lawful abortions. Furthermore, physicians who perform therapeutic abortions have useful expertise which would add to the precision and the integrity of the independent opinion itself. Some state control is appropriate to ensure the independence of the opinion. However, this rule as it now stands is excessive and can increase the risk of delay because fewer physicians are qualified to serve on the committees.
     The foregoing analysis of the administrative structure of s. 251(4) is by no means a complete catalogue of all the current systems' strengths and failings. It demonstrates, however, that the administrative structure put in place by Parliament has enough shortcomings so that s. 251(4), when considered as a whole, violates the principles of fundamental justice. These shortcomings stem from rules which are not necessary to the purposes for which s. 251(4) was established. These  


page 122

unnecessary rules, because they impose delays which result in an additional risk to women's health, are manifestly unfair.
     V -- Section 1  of the Charter 
     I agree with the view that s. 1  of the Charter  can be used to save a legislative provision which breaches s. 7  in the manner which s. 251  of the Criminal Code  violates s. 7  in this case. Section 1  states:
     1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.
     The Chief Justice provided an analysis of s. 1  in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at pp. 138-39, which is appropriate for the purposes of addressing s. 1  in the case at bar. Those seeking to uphold s. 251  of the Criminal Code  must demonstrate the following:
     (1) the objective which s. 251  is designed to serve must ""relate to concerns which are pressing and substantial""; and
     (2) ""once a sufficiently significant objective is recognized, then the party invoking s. 1  must show that the means chosen are reasonable and demonstrably justified. This involves a `form of proportionality test'.""
     I shall consider each of these two criteria which must be met if the limit on the s. 7  right is to be found reasonable.
     (1) The Objective of s. 251 
     I agree with Wilson J.'s characterization of s. 251 , explained in the following terms, at p. 181:
     In my view, the primary objective of the impugned legislation must be seen as the protection of the foetus. It undoubtedly has other ancillary objectives, such as the protection of the life and health of pregnant women, but I believe that the main objective advanced to justify a restriction on the pregnant woman's s. 7  right is the protection of the foetus.


page 123


     The primary objective of the protection of the foetus is the main objective relevant to the analysis of s. 251  under the first test of Oakes. With the greatest respect, I believe the Chief Justice incorrectly identifies (at p. 75) the objective of balancing foetal interests and those of pregnant women, ""with the lives and health of women a major factor"", as ""sufficiently important to meet the requirements of the first step in the Oakes inquiry under s. 1 "".
     The focus in Oakes is the objective ""which the measures responsible for a limit on a Charter  right or freedom are designed to serve"" (supra, at p. 138). In the context of the criminal law of abortion, the objective, which the measures in s. 251  responsible for a limit on the s. 7  Charter  right are designed to serve, is the protection of the foetus. The narrow aim of s. 251(4)  should not be confused with the primary objective of s. 251  as a whole. Given that s. 251  is a ""comprehensive code"", to use the expression of the Chief Justice, it is inappropriate, in my view, to focus on the exculpatory provision alone as the statement of Parliament's objective in establishing the crime. (See R. v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 713, at p. 751, in which the Court unanimously held that an exemption must be read in light of the affirmative provision to which it relates.) The ancillary objective of protecting the life or health of the pregnant woman, whether viewed alone or balanced against the protection of the foetus, is not the primary objective which the measures responsible for a limit on the constitutional right to security of the person were put in place to achieve.
     This balance cannot be considered as Parliament's objective in establishing the crime nor in maintaining this activity as a crime following the amendments to the Criminal Code  in 1969. Section 251(4)  only applies in specified circumstances. When the life or health of a pregnant woman is not in danger and she seeks an abortion on the basis of her own non-medical ""priorities and aspirations"", it is plain that the rules in s. 251   


page 124

precluding her from obtaining a lawful abortion have as their sole objective the protection of the foetus.
     Furthermore, as federal legislation in respect of Parliament's jurisdiction over the criminal law in s. 91(27)  of the Constitution Act, 1867 , s. 251  cannot be said to have as its sole or principal objective, as the appellants argue, the protection of the life or health of pregnant women. Legislation which in its pith and substance is related to the life or health of pregnant women, depending of course on its precise terms, would be characterized as in relation to one of the provincial heads of power (see Schneider v. The Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 112, at p. 137, per Dickson J., as he then was). The exculpatory provision in s. 251(4)  cannot stand on its own as a valid exercise of Parliament's criminal law power.
     Does the objective of protecting the foetus in s. 251  relate to concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society? The answer to the first step of the Oakes test is yes. I am of the view that the protection of the foetus is and, as the Court of Appeal observed, always has been, a valid objective in Canadian criminal law. I have already elaborated on this objective in my discussion of the principles of fundamental justice. I think s. 1  of the Charter  authorizes reasonable limits to be put on a woman's right having regard to the state interest in the protection of the foetus.
     (2) Proportionality
     I turn now to the second test in Oakes. The Crown must show that the means chosen in s. 251  are reasonable and demonstrably justified. In Oakes, supra, at p. 139, the Chief Justice outlined three components of the proportionality test:
     First, the measures adopted must be carefully designed to achieve the objective in question. They must not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations. In short, they must be rationally connected to the objective. Second, the means, even if rationally connected to the objective in this first sense, should impair ""as little  


page 125

as possible"" the right or freedom in question: R. v. Big M. Drug Mart Ltd., ... at p. 352. Third, there must be a proportionality between the effects of the measures which are responsible for limiting the Charter  right or freedom, and the objective which has been identified as of ""sufficient importance"".
     For the purposes of the first component of proportionality, I observe that it was necessary, in my discussion of s. 251(4) and the principles of fundamental justice, to explain my view that certain of the rules governing access to therapeutic abortions free from criminal sanction are unnecessary in respect of the objectives which s. 251 is designed to serve. A rule which is unnecessary in respect of Parliament's objectives cannot be said to be ""rationally connected"" thereto or to be ""carefully designed to achieve the objective in question"". Furthermore, not only are some of the rules in s. 251 unnecessary to the primary objective of the protection of the foetus and the ancillary objective of the protection of the pregnant woman's life or health, but their practical effect is to undermine the health of the woman which Parliament purports to consider so important. Consequently, s. 251 does not meet the proportionality test in Oakes.
     There is no saving s. 251 by simply severing the offending portions of s. 251(4). The current rule expressed in s. 251, which articulates both Parliament's principal and ancillary objectives, cannot stand without the exception in s. 251(4). The violation of pregnant women's security of the person would be greater, not lesser, if s. 251(4) was severed leaving the remaining subsections of s. 251 as they are in the Criminal Code .
     Given my conclusion in respect of the first component of the proportionality test, it is not necessary to address the questions as to wheth",1988-01-28 00:00:00,CA Supreme Court

                   The
appellants O and S and two accomplices, D and L, were charged with first degree
murder. D pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit murder and the
murder charge against her was withdrawn. She then gave evidence for the Crown
at the murder trial. The evidence adduced at trial indicated that D and the
appellants, three alcoholics, had agreed to get rid of D's paramour. The
appellants then met L who agreed to do the killing. On the day of the crime,
the three men drank heavily. In the evening, while O was sleeping, S and L left
for the victim's home. S entered the house and told the victim that someone
wanted to talk to him. When he stepped outside, L shot and killed him. The
three men were arrested shortly after the murder and S made a statement to the
police denying any involvement in the killing. Two hours later, he made a
second statement recorded on tape where he repudiated the earlier statement and
described his participation in the events. On the transcript of the second
statement, S appeared to be a ""vulgar drunk"", suffering withdrawal
symptoms and confused about many details. The first statement was ruled
admissible but the second was not put into evidence by the Crown despite
attempts by the defence to have it admitted. Appellants' defence was that they
had never formed the intent to kill D's paramour. They contended that the
discussions about killing him were merely ""drunk talk"". The trial judge
instructed the jury on the effect of drunkenness and with respect to s. 21(1) 
and (2)  of the Criminal Code . They were convicted of second degree
murder and their appeals to the Court of Appeal were dismissed. These appeals
are to determine whether the trial judge erred (1) in instructing the jury to
the effect that s. 21(2) of the Code is applicable to a case in which
the unlawful purpose in question is the offence with which the accused are
charged; (2) in failing to instruct the jury that the fact that an accomplice
pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit murder was not evidence as
against the accused; and (3) in refusing to allow the admission into evidence
of the second statement. It was contended that this statement should have been
admitted to show S's state of mind when the first statement was made and to
rebut the Crown's suggestion of recent fabrication of a defence.

 

                   Held: The appeals
should be dismissed.

 

                   The
trial judge erred in instructing the jury with respect to s. 21(2) of the Code.
Section 21(2)  covers the case where, in the absence of aiding and abetting, a
person may become a party to an offence committed by another which he knew or
ought to have known was a probable consequence of carrying out an unlawful
purpose in common with the actual perpetrator. It does not apply to a case in
which the unlawful purpose mentioned in that section is the offence which is
ultimately charged.

 

                   The
trial judge should have warned the jury that D's guilty plea to the conspiracy
charge could not be considered evidence against the appellants on the issue of
their guilt or innocence. But the omission to give the warning against such
misuse of the evidence is not always fatal. In this case where there was no
real conflict between D's evidence and that of the appellants, as to the
particulars of the conspiracy and the actual killing, the omission of the warning
did not amount to reversible error.

 

                   Although,
as a general rule, statements of an accused person made outside court are not
receivable in evidence for him, such statements may be admissible where they
are relevant to show the state of mind of an accused at a given time or to
rebut the suggestion of recent fabrication of a defence. In this case, the
second statement was consistent with the evidence given by S at trial and
should have been admitted but only to rebut the Crown's allegation of recent invention
of a defence.

 

                   Section
613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  should be applied in this
case to affirm the convictions. It is clear from the whole of the evidence
that, despite the trial judge's errors, the result would necessarily have been
the same. The only conclusion the jury could have reached on the evidence was
that the appellants aided and abetted L in the killing.

judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

1.                       McIntyre J.‑‑This
appeal from the Court of Appeal of British Columbia comes before the Court as
of right, pursuant to the provisions of s. 618 (l)(a) of the Criminal
Code . The two appellants were convicted of second degree murder as the
result of the killing of one Brousseau, at Kimberley, British Columbia, on May
2, 1980, and their appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on July 5, 1983,
with one dissent: (1983), 6 C.C.C. (3d) 516.

 

2.                       The
deceased Brousseau had lived with Giselle Dumoulin for some twenty years prior
to his death. Dumoulin and the appellant Ochs met in May of 1979 and by April
of 1980 a sexual relationship had developed between them. At that time, the
deceased was working away from Kimberley. Dumoulin and Ochs were both
alcoholics and for some time prior to the killing both had been drinking
heavily. In this activity they were frequently joined by the appellant Simpson,
a friend of Ochs and also an alcoholic. On an occasion during the third week of
April 1980, when the three, Dumoulin, Ochs and Simpson, were at Dumoulin's
house in Kimberley, Dumoulin complained of the treatment she received from her
paramour, the deceased, and said he had made a sexual attack on her daughter.
According to Dumoulin's evidence, it was upon this occasion that Ochs asked her
how much it would be worth to her to get rid of Brousseau. She replied that she
didn't know but when Ochs suggested a figure of $10,000 she replied,
""O.K."" On April 23rd or 24th, there were further discussions of
Brousseau's conduct toward Dumoulin's daughter. On April 26th, one L'Ortye, a
co‑accused with Simpson and Ochs, arrived in Kimberley. He was introduced
to Ochs and Simpson by one Carrier, at whose home L'Ortye was living. The
deceased Brousseau returned to Kimberley on April 27th, 1980.

 

3.                       On
April 30th, 1980, according to the evidence of Carrier, there was a further
discussion of Brousseau's conduct in L'Ortye's presence when Ochs said that
""Brousseau has to go"". From this occasion, L'Ortye joined Ochs and
Simpson in their heavy drinking. On May 1st, Ochs telephoned Dumoulin and said
that he had a guy who would ""do the job"" for $10,000. That day, the
three, Simpson, Ochs and L'Ortye, drove past Brousseau's house, which was
pointed out to L'Ortye. On Friday, May 2nd, the day of the killing, Dumoulin
telephoned Ochs and made an arrangement to meet him at a school near Kimberley.
Ochs, Simpson and L'Ortye drove in Ochs' car to the school where they met
Dumoulin who had arrived in her car. Ochs left his vehicle and spoke with
Dumoulin. According to her evidence, during this conversation Ochs pointed out
L'Ortye and said that he would kill Brousseau for $5,000.

 

4.                       During
the afternoon of May 2nd, 1980, Ochs, Simpson and L'Ortye were at Ochs' home in
Kimberley. At some time during the afternoon, L'Ortye borrowed Ochs' car and
retrieved a rifle, which was used in the shooting, from a hiding place where he
said he had concealed it. It is not clear whether Ochs or Simpson accompanied
him on this occasion. Dumoulin testified that at approximately 6:00 p.m. the
same evening, May 2nd, she made a telephone call to Ochs, during which there
was a discussion about preparation to kill Brousseau. Ochs denied this
conversation. Ochs' daughter testified as to the events at Ochs' home during
the afternoon and evening of May 2nd. She said that after some conversation
between the three men, Ochs, Simpson and L'Ortye, Ochs went to sleep on a
chesterfield in the living room. L'Ortye brought in a rifle from the car. When
he was cleaning and loading it, the rifle went off and made a hole in the
kitchen ceiling. Ochs slept through this incident. There was continual drinking
on this occasion by the three men.

 

5.                       According
to the evidence given at trial, at some time in the evening on May 2nd Simpson
and L'Ortye left Ochs' home and drove in Ochs' car to a public house. After a
short stay, they left with Simpson driving. He was drunk, however, and L'Ortye
took over the driving while Simpson went to sleep. L'Ortye drove to Brousseau's
house and on arrival Simpson awoke. According to Dumoulin's evidence, between
9:00 and 9:30 p.m. on May 2nd, a car drove into the driveway of the Brousseau
home. Simpson came to the door and asked for Brousseau. He entered the house
and told Brousseau that there was someone outside who wished to speak to him.
Brousseau went out and returned shortly, saying no one was there, but at
Simpson's suggestion, he went out a second time and on this occasion L'Ortye
shot and killed him. The evidence is unclear as to exactly where Simpson was
when the shot was fired. Simpson and L'Ortye then drove off, with Simpson
driving. At some point, they stopped and L'Ortye hid the rifle. They then went
to the home of one Thompson where they did some drinking. After some time, they
left Kimberley, still in Ochs' car, and drove to Cranbrook where they arrived
at one Malberg's house at about 2:00 a.m., May 3rd, 1980.

 

6.                       When
Simpson and L'Ortye departed from Ochs' home with his car in the early evening
of May 2nd, Ochs himself was asleep. He awoke about 11:00 p.m. and went to a
public house in Kimberley. When it closed, he came home where he received a
telephone call about 4:00 a.m. from Simpson. Ochs then went by taxi to
Malberg's house in Cranbrook, where he met Simpson and L'Ortye, and where he
learned of the shooting and the disposal of the rifle.

 

7.                       At
about 8:00 a.m. on May 3rd, the police came to Malberg's home in Cranbrook and
arrested Ochs and Simpson. L'Ortye, who was present at that time, was allowed
to leave. He was later arrested in Kimberley. Ochs and Simpson were taken to
the police station in Cranbrook, where Ochs gave a statement to the police at
8:50 a.m. in which he said that at the time of the shooting he was in a hotel
bar and that Simpson had his car. He said that his relationship with Dumoulin did
not involve sexual relations. At approximately 9:00 a.m., Simpson made a
statement to the police, in which he said that he was last at Brousseau's house
some five days before the killing. The police then drove Ochs and Simpson to
the police station in Kimberley. Ochs gave a second statement to the police
about 11:00 a.m. in which he told much the same story as before. Both
statements were put in evidence at the trial. Simpson was also interviewed a
second time at Kimberley commencing about 11:15 a.m. on May 3rd. The ensuing
conversation, partly in the police station and continuing later in a police
car, was recorded on tape and then transcribed. It will hereafter be referred
to as the second or 11:15 a.m. statement. It, in effect, repudiated the earlier
statement and described at some length his participation in the events in
connection with the case. It was not put into evidence by the Crown, despite
the fact that counsel for Simpson repeatedly endeavoured to have it admitted.
Dumoulin, Simpson, Ochs and L'Ortye were arrested and charged with first degree
murder. Dumoulin pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to kill Brousseau and
the murder charge was withdrawn. She was sentenced to four years' imprisonment.
She then gave evidence for the Crown at the trial of L'Ortye, Ochs and Simpson.

 

8.                       At
trial, all three accused were convicted of second degree murder and sentenced
to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for ten years. The Crown's
theory at the trial was that L'Ortye committed the murder and Simpson and Ochs
aided and abetted the killing. In this, the Crown relied on ss. 21(1) (b)
and (c) of the Criminal Code . The Crown also took the position
that s. 21(2) of the Code was applicable because the three accused formed
an intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose, that is, to murder
Brousseau, and L'Ortye did so. Alternatively, the Crown took the position that
the three accused together formed an intention in common to effect the unlawful
purpose of scaring Brousseau and in carrying out the purpose one of them,
L'Ortye, killed Brousseau.

 

9.                       Ochs'
defence was that he had never formed the intent to kill Brousseau. He said that
the talk and discussions about killing him were merely ""drunk talk"".
It was also said that he thought L'Ortye only intended to frighten Brousseau.
Though not raised as a defence by Ochs at his trial, the trial judge considered
that on the evidence, the defence of abandonment of the common purpose could be
open and he instructed the jury upon it. He also instructed on the effect of
drunkenness on Ochs' capacity to form the intent to kill. Simpson's defence was
also that he had not formed the intent to kill Brousseau and that talk of such
a thing was all drunk talk. He raised the defence of duress, saying he was
afraid of L'Ortye and that he only went to Brousseau's house out of fear. The
charge with respect to drunkenness also applied to Simpson. L'Ortye abandoned
his appeal and the appeals of Ochs and Simpson were dismissed on July 5. Notice
of appeal to this Court was given on September 13, 1983.

 

10.                     In
the Court of Appeal (McFarlane, Taggart, Seaton, Craig and Macfarlane JJ.A.)
three judgments were written. Taggart J.A., with whom McFarlane and Macfarlane
JJ.A. concurred, dismissed the appeal on the grounds that in his view the trial
judge did not err in his instructions to the jury in respect of s. 21(2)  of the
Criminal Code , there was no error in the failure to instruct the jury as
to the effect of Dumoulin's plea of guilty to the conspiracy charge, and
Simpson's second statement was properly rejected. Craig J.A. wrote a separate
judgment which concurred in the result, but in which he expressed the view that
the trial judge had erred in his instructions to the jury on s. 21(2)  and in
failing to warn them about Dumoulin's guilty plea. He was of the opinion,
however, that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred, and
he applied the proviso in s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code to
dismiss the appeal. Seaton J.A. dissented and the grounds of his dissent are
recorded in the formal order of the Court of Appeal in these terms:

 

1. THAT the learned trial court judge erred in
instructing the jury to the effect that Section 21(2)  of the Criminal Code  is
applicable to a case in which the unlawful purpose in question is the offence
with which the accused is charged in the indictment.

 

2. THAT, in the circumstances to this case, the
learned trial court Judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that the fact
that Giselle Dumoulin pled guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit murder
was not evidence as against the accused Simpson and Ochs.

 

3. THAT, the learned trial court judge erred in
refusing to allow the admission into evidence of a tape‑recorded
statement made by the accused Simpson to the police shortly after 11:00 a.m.
May the 3rd 1980.

 

Section 21  of the Criminal
Code 

 

11.                     The
first ground of dissent in the Court of Appeal has been set out above. Seaton
J.A. was of the view that it was error to equate the unlawful purpose referred
to in s. 21(2)  with the actual offence charged. It is apparent that, in his
view, this case was not one which engaged s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code 
but rather fell for decision under the provisions of s. 21(1) .

 

12.                     In
charging the jury, the trial judge gave directions upon both s. 21(1)  and s.
21(2)  of the Criminal Code  and directed the jury on the evidence
relevant to these issues. No exception was taken to his direction as it applied
to s. 21(1)  and no error in respect of it is asserted before this Court. It was
the trial judge's treatment of s. 21(2)  which provoked Seaton J.A.'s dissent on
this issue. As stated in the formal order of the Court of Appeal, the question
is: Is section 21(2) of the Criminal Code  ""applicable to a case in
which the unlawful purpose in question is the offence with which the accused is
charged in the indictment?""

 

13.                     There
has been a good deal of controversy on this issue and it has been agreed by
most judges who have expressed views on the matter that the words of s. 21(2) 
of the Criminal Code  on their face could bear either meaning, that is to
say, the one attributed to the section by Taggart J.A. or that favoured by
Seaton J.A. in his dissent. Taggart J.A. was of the view that a trial judge was
entitled to leave s. 21(2) of the Code with the jury, even when the
intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose which renders the
subsection applicable was to commit the actual offence charged. He discussed
various authorities and relied upon the statement of McFarlane J.A. in R. v.
Wong (1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d) 196 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 202:

 

                   Again, with great respect, there is
confusion between intention (to carry out an unlawful purpose and assist
therein) and the knowledge, actual or imputed, of a probable consequence of
carrying out the purpose. So far as intention is an element I think the
provisions of our subsection are satisfied if there is an intention in common
to carry out an unlawful purpose and it matters not whether the unlawful common
purpose was culpable homicide. Our subsection makes a person party to an
offence where his only intention is to carry out an unlawful purpose, provided
he knew or ought to have known that the offence actually committed was a
probable consequence of carrying out the unlawful purpose.

 

It may be observed,
however, that while this statement has frequently been cited as authority
supporting the view favoured by Taggart J.A., it was made in a somewhat
different context. McFarlane J.A. in Wong, when he used the words
referred to above, was responding to an argument raised on behalf of Wong that
there had been error at trial when the trial judge failed to leave open a
possible conviction of manslaughter if there had been no intent to kill.
McFarlane J.A. was pointing out that the only element of intent required in s.
21(2) of the Code is the intent to carry out an unlawful purpose and
assist each other in connection therewith. Thereafter, any offence committed by
one of them would render the other guilty of the actual offence committed
without any further consideration of intent. I would therefore express some
doubt as to the applicability of these words in considering the question
arising here which involves no question of an included offence with a differing
intention. Both Seaton and Craig JJ.A. disagreed with Taggart J.A. Dealing with
this question, Seaton J.A. said, at pp. 535‑36:

 

                   I see no need to strain the language
of s. 21(2)  to encompass a case where the offence committed is the offence that
was intended. The provisions of ss. 21(1)  and 22  are quite sufficient,
especially when the word ""abet"" is given its full meaning. Much of the
evidence that points to Ochs and Simpson being parties pursuant to s. 21(2) 
points also to them being abettors, aiders and counsellors.

 

                   Offering s. 21(2) in the manner it
was offered here might induce confusion. To say that ""when two or more
form an intention in common to murder Brousseau and in murdering Brousseau, one
of them murders Brousseau each of them who knew that the murdering of Brousseau
would be a probable consequence of carrying out the murder of Brousseau...'' is
bound to confuse the jury. Of course, the trial judge did not put it in those
words, but that was what was meant . . . .

 

And in a similar
vein Craig J.A. said, at p. 543:

 

In other words, the ""unlawful purpose"" and
""the offence"" committed in the course of carrying out the
""unlawful purpose"" are different. I think that s‑s.(2) is
supplementary to s‑s.(1) and that in enacting it Parliament intended to
ensure that a person would be a party not only to an offence which he aided or
abetted but also to an offence which he did not aid nor abet but which he knew
or ought to have known was a probable consequence of carrying out the unlawful
purpose.

 

They also relied on
the words of Robertson J.A. in R. v. Miller and Cockriell (1975), 24
C.C.C. (2d) 401 (B.C.C.A.) (appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed,
[1977] 2 S.C.R. 680), at pp. 439‑40:

 

                   I cannot accede to this argument. I
doubt that this was a case under s. 21(2) at all. That deals primarily with a
case where A and B form an intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose
and in carrying out that purpose one of them commits an offence. It does not
appear to me to be directed to a case where A and B form an intention to commit
a particular crime and in carrying out their intent do commit that crime. The
latter type of case is covered by s. 21(1). In s. 21(1) I think that para. (a)
fits the case at bar: Miller held the barrel of the rifle in position to shoot
out the window and Cockriell pulled the trigger; together they aimed and fired
the rifle and each was equally guilty of shooting the constable to death.
Alternatively, if I am wrong and Cockriell alone did the shooting, para. (b)
makes Miller a party to the offence.

 

                   In my opinion the effect of s. 21(2)
does not extend back into s. 21(1) so as to make it necessary, where s. 21(1)
applies, to charge the jury about probable consequence. It would be absurd to
tell a jury that, if they find that the accused intended to kill a man, they
must be satisfied that he knew that, if he did kill the man, a probable
consequence would be that the man would be dead.

 

Taggart J.A., who
had carefully examined many of the authorities, did not consider that these
words of Robertson J.A. in Miller and Cockriell supported the position
taken by Seaton J.A. In his view, Robertson J.A. had simply held that s. 21(2)
of the Code did not apply to the facts in that case. It was a case which
fell properly into s. 21(1) and reference to s. 21(2) was therefore
unnecessary. Nevertheless, the words of Robertson J.A. have frequently been
used to support the position of Seaton J.A. in his dissent. The Ontario Court
of Appeal dealt with this issue in R. v. Turkiewicz, Barrow and MacNamara
(1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 406, where Zuber J.A., speaking for the court (Brooke,
Arnup and Zuber JJ.A.), said at p. 409:

 

Section 21(2) which speaks of the knowledge of probable
consequences has no application to this case when the parties did precisely
what they set out to do: see R. v. Miller and Cockriell (1975), 24
C.C.C. (2d) 401 at p. 440, 63 D.L.R. (3d) 193 at p. 232, 33 C.R.N.S. 129
(affirmed 31 C.C.C. (2d) 177, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 680, 70 D.L.R. (3d) 324). It is
only s. 21(1) that can have any application to this case and in the light of
the facts of this case the mere reading of the section was sufficient.

 

And, more recently,
Howland C.J.O. in R. v. Howard and Trudel (1983), 3 C.C.C. (3d) 399,
said at p. 408:

 

It was held by this court in R. v. Turkiewicz, Barrow
and MacNamara (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 406, 103 D.L.R. (3d) 332, 26 O.R. (2d)
570, that s. 21(2) does not apply where the parties do precisely what they set
out to do. Under s. 21(2) where two or more persons form an intention in common
to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein, the unlawful
purpose referred to is not the offence charged.

 

It could be said
that both Turkiewicz and Howard were cases where on their facts
s. 21(2) of the Code did not apply; that they were cases of aiding and
abetting more properly to be considered under s. 21(1). They do, however, in my
view, support the views expressed by Seaton J.A. in his dissent and by Craig
J.A. on this issue.

 

14.                     While
acknowledging that the words of s. 21  of the Criminal Code  could be read
to support either contention, and while not overlooking the fact that I was a
member of the court in Wong and in Miller and Cockriell, which
cases are said to express conflicting views on the question, I am of the
opinion that the weight of the authorities supports the dissenting view of
Seaton J.A., to the effect that the unlawful purpose mentioned in s. 21(2)  must
be different from the offence which is actually charged. In reaching this
conclusion, I adopt the words of Craig J.A., supra. The ""unlawful
purpose"" and ""the offence"" committed in the course of the
pursuit of the unlawful purpose are different. The two subsections of s. 21 
deal with different circumstances. Subsection (1) applies to make everyone a
party to an offence who commits it or who aids and abets in its commission.
Subsection (2) covers the case where, in the absence of aiding and abetting, a
person may become a party to an offence committed by another which he knew or
ought to have known was a probable consequence of carrying out an unlawful
purpose in common with the actual perpetrator. I am of the opinion that the
trial judge was in error in his charge to the jury with respect to s. 21(2)  of
the Criminal Code .

 

Dumoulin's Guilty
Plea

 

15.                     It
will be recalled that Dumoulin, after pleading guilty to conspiracy and being
sentenced, gave evidence for the Crown. In dealing with her evidence in his
charge to the jury, the trial judge instructed the jury that there was evidence
upon which they could conclude that she had been an accomplice of Ochs, Simpson
and L'Ortye and that it was dangerous to convict upon the evidence of an
accomplice in the absence of corroboration but they could do so if satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accomplice evidence was true. The charge was
delivered before the rendering of this Court's judgment in Vetrovec v. The
Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811. He gave further instructions as to the nature
of corroborative evidence and reviewed the relevant evidence for them. No
objection is taken to the charge in this respect. The appellants, however,
argue that the jury should have been directed, as well, that the fact that
Dumoulin had pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge could not be considered as
evidence against Simpson, Ochs and L'Ortye on the issue of their guilt or
innocence.

 

16.                     In
the Court of Appeal, Seaton J.A., with whom Craig J.A. agreed on this issue,
was of the view that the omission of a direction to the above effect, with respect
to the evidence of Dumoulin, was an error of great significance. He referred to
R. v. Caron (1971), 9 C.C.C. (2d) 447 (Ont. C.A.), and R. v. Ellis
(1972), 6 C.C.C. (2d) 220 (Ont. C.A.), as well as other authorities which deal
with the question. Taggart J.A. distinguished the decisions relied upon by
Seaton J.A. on the basis that they dealt with cases where the plea of guilty
had been entered to the same offence with which a co‑accused was charged,
whereas in the case at bar Dumoulin had pleaded guilty to a charge of
conspiracy while the others had been charged with murder. This distinction was
not considered sufficient by Seaton J.A.

 

17.                     This
question was said to be of particular importance in this case. Dumoulin pleaded
guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit the crime which was, in fact,
committed, and with which her co‑conspirators were charged. In addition
she gave evidence, the admissibility of which was incontestable, which, taken
with other evidence including that of Ochs and Simpson, tied Ochs and Simpson
into the conspiracy and furnished evidence of motive and of the actual killing.
It was argued that it would have been a very natural mistake for the jury to
consider that, since she had pleaded guilty to entering into an agreement to
procure the killing of Brousseau, she could only have done so with Ochs and
Simpson. This they might naturally consider as cogent evidence of guilt of the
murder of Brousseau by Ochs and Simpson. It is for this reason that it has been
considered necessary to warn juries of the danger of misapplying evidence in
this fashion.

 

18.                     In
R. v. Caron, supra, the Ontario Court of Appeal (Aylesworth,
McGillivray and Evans JJ.A.) considered this question. In that case, on a
charge of robbery an accomplice of Caron pleaded guilty to robbery and gave
evidence for the Crown. Aylesworth J.A., speaking for the court, said at
pp. 447‑48:

 

                   The entire trial, and it was a
lengthy trial, of the appellant is permeated, and not improperly permeated, but
nevertheless permeated with evidence of the actions of the accomplice Funnell.
The question of the guilt or innocence of the appellant is irrevocably entwined
with the actions of Funnell.

 

                   That being so, we think it was
directly incumbent upon the trial Judge to warn the jury not only as to his
being an accomplice, which we think was done satisfactorily, but that the fact
that Funnell had pleaded guilty to the same charge as was before them with
respect to the appellant and had been convicted and sentenced on that plea, was
no evidence whatsoever of the guilt of the appellant. We think it was vital to
a fair trial that this be done despite the fact, as I have said, that the
evidence of Funnell's actions permeated the entire evidence as to trial and
that Funnell himself gave extensive evidence in the witness‑box. It still
remained a paramount duty of the trial Judge in such circumstances, we think,
to warn the jury against their very likely mistake, if not warned, that Caron
must be guilty since he was associated with Funnell and Funnell had pleaded
guilty, had been convicted upon that plea and sentenced.

 

19.                     This
view was approved in the related case of R. v. Ellis, supra, and,
for an English case dealing with the same point, see R. v. Moore (1956),
40 Cr. App. R. 50. It may well be observed, however, that while the role played
in this case by Dumoulin was indeed significant, particularly when it is
recalled that she instigated the plot, her evidence was largely consistent with
that given by both Ochs and Simpson at trial. On the authorities, however, a
warning such as that contended for here should have been given to the jury.

 

20.                     This
question was considered again in R. v. Pentiluk and MacDonald (1974), 28
C.R.N.S. 324 (Ont. C.A.) Pentiluk and MacDonald were jointly charged with
murder in two indictments dealing with two killings. Both killings occurred in
one transaction and the indictments were tried together. Pentiluk pleaded
guilty to manslaughter. MacDonald argued that the trial judge should have
warned the jury that the guilty plea of manslaughter by Pentiluk was not
evidence against him. At page 330, Martin J.A., speaking for the court (Gale
C.J.O., Evans and Martin JJ.A.) said:

 

                   The other grounds of appeal with
respect to which the Court required to hear argument from the Crown relate only
to the appellant MacDonald. The first of such grounds is that the learned trial
Judge erred in failing to direct the jury that the plea of guilty by Pentiluk
was not evidence in any way against the appellant MacDonald, in conformity with
the judgment of this Court in Regina v. Caron (1973), 9 C.C.C. (2d) 447.
In some circumstances the failure to so direct the jury would constitute
serious non‑direction. However, in the present case the foundation of the
defence advanced by the appellant MacDonald was that Pentiluk had shot the
deceased, but that he was not a party to the killings. It is difficult to
understand how an admission by Pentiluk that he had killed the deceased could
prejudice the appellant MacDonald, in view of the nature of his defence.
Moreover, the learned trial Judge was not requested by counsel at the trial to
instruct the jury in the way it is now argued that he should have instructed
them in this respect.

 

A similar comment
was made by Martin J.A. for the court (Arnup, Martin and Thorson JJ.A.) in R.
v. MacGregor (1981), 64 C.C.C. (2d) 353, at pp. 357‑58, in these
terms:

 

                   The second ground of appeal on which
we required to hear argument from Crown counsel is that the trial Judge erred
in failing to instruct the jury that the pleas of guilty by the co‑accused
were not evidence against the appellant and in failing to direct the jury to
disregard those pleas in considering the case against the appellant.
Admittedly, it was error for the trial Judge to fail to instruct the jury that
in considering the case against the appellant they should disregard the pleas
of guilty of manslaughter by the co‑accused and that those pleas were not
in any way to be taken into account in considering the case against the
appellant. In some circumstances this failure would be fatal but in the
circumstances of this case it did not result in any real prejudice to the
appellant and Mr. Rosen, in the course of a very able argument, was unable to
satisfy us what prejudice there might have been.

 

These comments
follow Caron, but may be said to import the need to find a risk of
prejudice to the accused by the omission of the warning against the use of the
evidence of a guilty plea as evidence against a co‑accused. They also
stand for the proposition that an omission to give the warning against such
misuse of the evidence will not always be fatal. In this case, where, as has
been noted, there was no real conflict between the evidence of Dumoulin on
significant points and that of both co‑accused, as to the particulars of
the conspiracy and the actual killing, it is difficult to see how the omission
of the warning could amount to reversible error.

 

Admissibility of
Statement Made at 11:15 a.m., May 3, 1980

 

21.                     It
will be recalled that on the morning after the killing the police arrested
Simpson and Ochs at Cranbrook. They took a statement from Simpson at
approximately 9:00 a.m. which, having been found voluntary on a voir dire,
was admitted in evidence. They then took Simpson to Kimberley and commencing at
approximately 11:15 a.m. they took a second statement. This statement was made
in the presence of two R.C.M.P. officers, Lawson and Zaichkowsky. It was
recorded on tape and transcribed. It consists of some fourteen pages of
questions and answers covering the events which gave rise to these proceedings.
It was not tendered in evidence by the Crown but was exhibited on a voir dire.
It is difficult to ascertain from the record whether a specific finding was
made as to whether it was voluntary. This fact is unimportant for it is the
defence, not the Crown, which seeks the admission of the statement. The defence
at trial sought on various occasions to have the transcript admitted so it
could be considered by the jury, but its admission was refused. It is this
refusal which led to the third ground of dissent relied upon by Seaton J.A. in
the Court of Appeal. The first statement was recorded in the handwriting of the
officer Zaichkowsky. It is only two pages in length. It consists largely of a
series of questions posed by the police officer with the answers given by
Simpson. Simpson denies any participation in the events of the previous night
and denies that he was in Kimberley on that occasion, having spent the night in
Cranbrook. He also denies that he knew Brousseau. The answers attributed to
Simpson appear to be those of a rational person in full possession of his
faculties. The transcript of the second statement reveals a different picture.
He appears to be a ""vulgar drunk"" suffering withdrawal symptoms and
confused about many details. Seaton J.A. expressed the view that it was
difficult to believe that the first statement could be made by the same
rambling, drunken individual who made the second statement some two hours later
and without having done any further drinking in the interval. He was of the
view that the second statement was wrongly excluded by the trial judge, because
it was clear evidence of the state of mind of Simpson at the time he made the
first statement. He said, at p. 539:

 

                   If the jury had heard the tape‑recording
it is unlikely that they would have thought Simpson capable at nine o'clock in
the morning of the conduct which Crown counsel attributed to him. The tape‑recording
demonstrated Simpson's condition as no description could. He had nothing to
drink between the two statements, yet at 11:15 a.m. he was in a terrible state.
The answers in the nine o'clock statement bear no resemblance to the answers
given by the rambling, vulgar drunk we heard on the tape.

 

He saw as well a
further objection to the exclusion of the second statement. Crown counsel, he
said, had vigorously attacked the evidence given by Simpson, Ochs and L'Ortye,
partly on the basis that they had recently fabricated their defences. By
excluding the second statement, prejudice resulted to Simpson because the jury
was left with the suggestion that Simpson was a calculating liar, that he had
lied in the first statement and had persisted in the lies to the date of trial
when a recently fabricated story was then presented to the jury. In these
circumstances, ordinary justice required that the second statement, made only
two hours after the first, which he considered was largely consistent with the
evidence given by Simpson at trial, should be admitted. He said, at p. 540:

 

                   There is no rule excluding previous
consistent statements. They are rejected simply because they are valueless: see
Wigmore on Evidence (Chadbourn Rev.), vol. 4, § 1124. If for some reason
they become valuable then they become admissible. Thus a suggestion that
evidence was recently contrived makes an earlier consistent statement
admissible: see R. v. Wannebo (1972), 7 C.C.C. (2d) 266, [1972] 5 W.W.R.
372. The statement rebuts the suggestion of recent fabrication.

 

22.                     The
Crown position, briefly stated, is that the trial judge made no error in
declining to admit the second statement. It was contended that the second
statement is not admissible as a previous consistent statement to rebut the
allegation of recent fabrication, because the statement is not consistent with
the evidence given by Simpson at his trial.

 

23.                     Before
this Court it was contended for Simpson that the second statement was
receivable for four reasons. The first was that the 11:15 a.m. statement was
merely a continuation of the 9:30 statement. This ground was not seriously
argued before us and, in my view, has no merit. The second and third grounds
overlap. They are based on the proposition that the second statement recorded on
tape provided original circumstantial evidence of the state of mind and general
condition of Simpson when he made the first statement, and it was therefore
admissible on the issue of the weight that should be attributed to the first
statement and to the defence raised by Simpson. The fourth ground asserted that
the second statement was admissible to rebut the suggestion of recent invention
of a defence.

 

24.                     As
a general rule, the statements of an accused person made outside court‑‑subject
to a finding of voluntariness where the statement is made to one in authority‑‑are
receivable in evidence against him but not for him. This rule is based on the
sound proposition that an accused person should not be free to make an unsworn
statement and compel its admission into evidence through other witnesses and
thus put his defence before the jury without being put on oath and being
subjected, as well, to cross‑examination. It is, however, not an
inflexible rule, and in proper circumstances such statements may be admissible;
for example, where they are relevant to show the state of mind of an accused at
a given time or to rebut the suggestion of recent fabrication of a defence. The
first exception has been recognized in the authorities and in the text
writings. In Phipson on Evidence (13th ed. 1982), para. 7‑34, the
following appears:

 

                   Whenever the physical condition,
emotions, opinions and state of mind of a person are material to be proved, his
statements indicative thereof made at or about the time in question may be
given in evidence. In the case of physical condition or emotions, if they were
the natural language of the affection, whether of body or mind, they furnish
original and satisfactory evidence of its existence, and the question whether
they were real or feigned is for the jury to determine.

 

In the English case
of R. v. Willis (1959), 44 Cr. App. R. 32, at p. 37, Parker L.C.J. put
it in these terms:

 

...provided the evidence as to his state of mind and
conduct is relevant, it matters not whether it was in regard to the conduct at
the time of the commission of the offence or, as here, at a subsequent time to
explain his answers to the police and his conduct when charged.

 

As noted above,
Seaton J.A. found it impossible to believe that the ""vulgar drunk""
revealed in the second statement could have made the precise statement earlier
taken. The weight which the jury might give to the first statement could be
affected if they heard the second, and the significance of the lies in the first
statement might be greatly diminished upon a consideration of the state of mind
revealed in the second.

 

25.                     The
suggestion of recent fabrication may, as well, be met by the introduction of a
previous statement of the accused. Phipson, supra, at para. 33‑50,
states:

 

                   (c) Statements rebutting an
allegation of recent fabrication. ""If, in cross‑examination, a
witness's account of some incident or set of facts is challenged as being a
recent invention, thus presenting a clear issue as to whether at some previous
time he said or thought what he has been saying at the trial, he may support
himself by evidence of earlier statements by him to the same effect. Plainly
the rule that sets up the exception cannot be formulated with any great
precision, since its application will depend on the nature of the challenge
offered by the course of cross‑examination and the relative cogency of
the evidence tendered to repel it."" The rule was applied by the Court of
Appeal (Criminal Division) in 1971. The mere fact that the witness's testimony
is impeached in cross‑examination does not render such evidence
admissible.

 

and in a similar
vein see McWilliams in Canadian Criminal Evidence (2nd ed. 1984), at p.
355:

 

                   If, on cross‑examination, a
witness' account of some incident or set of facts is challenged as being of
recent invention or concoction, this raises an issue which the party calling
the witness is permitted to rebut by showing that at some earlier time, the
witness made an earlier statement to the same effect: Fox v. General Medical
Council, [1960] 3 All E.R. 225 (P.C.); R. v. Benjamin (1913), 8 Cr.
App. R. 146; R. v. Neigel (1918), 29 C.C.C. 232 (Alta. S.C. App. Div.); R.
v. Coyle (1855), 7 Cox C.C. 74; R. v. St. Lawrence (1949), 93 C.C.C.
376 (Ont. H.C.J.); R. v. Lalonde (1971), 5 C.C.C. (2d) 168 (Ont.
H.C.J.); R. v. Wannebo (1972), 7 C.C.C. (2d) 266 (B.C.C.A.). As to
admission of previous consistent statements prior to cross‑examination
see: R. v. Giraldi (1975), 28 C.C.C. (2d) 248 (B.C.C.A.); R. v.
Racine (1977), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 468 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Campbell, supra.
See generally, ""Consistent Statements of a Witness"" by M. T.
MacCrimmon, 17 Osgoode Hall L.J. 285 (1979).

 

26.                     The
courts have recently applied this exception to the general rule against the
admission of self‑serving statements by the accused where no direct
allegation of recent fabrication has been made. In R. v. Giraldi (1975),
28 C.C.C. (2d) 248 (B.C.C.A.), McFarlane J.A., speaking for the court
(McFarlane, Branca, Carrothers JJ.A.), said, at p. 253:

 

                   I find the reasoning of the Judges in
this case impelling. That reasoning does not support the proposition that the
only basis for applying the exception and admitting the evidence is the fact
that cross‑examination of the witness has been of such a nature as to lay
a foundation for inferring a recently fabricated or contrived story. On the
contrary it supports the view, which in my opinion is the correct one, that
that foundation may be laid in other ways including the whole circumstances of
the case and the conduct of the trial. Moreover, it is very much a matter for
the trial Judge who is required to consider the question of admissibility with
great care before allowing the earlier self‑serving statement to be
admitted.

 

                   I think also this view that a
suggestion of recent fabrication need not necessarily be made expressly but may
arise implicitly is supported on a careful consideration of the judgments of
the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Pappin (1970), 12 C.R.N.S. 287, and
R. v. Rosik (1970), 2 C.C.C. (2d) 351, [1971] 2 O.R. 47, 13 C.R.N.S. 129
(appeal in the latter to the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed, 2 C.C.C. (2d)
393n, [1971] 2 O.R. 89n, [1971] S.C.R. vi).

 

And in R. v.
Campbell (1977), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 6 (Ont. C.A.), Martin J.A., speaking for
the court (Arnup, Martin and Lacourcière JJ.A.), said, at pp. 18‑19:

 

                   I accept the proposition that an
express allegation of recent fabrication in cross‑examination is not
necessary before the exception with respect to rebutting an allegation of
recent fabrication becomes operative, and that a suggestion that the accused's
story has been recently contrived may also arise implicitly from the whole
circumstances of the case, the evidence of the witnesses who have been called,
and the conduct of the trial. Where the circumstances are such as to raise the
suggestion that the accused's evidence is a recent fabrication, counsel may
properly anticipate the allegation of recent fabrication in cross‑examination,
and examine the accused in chief with respect to previous statements to other
persons, prior to his being cross‑examined: see R. v. Giraldi
(1975), 28 C.C.C. (2d) 248, [1975] W.W.D. 166; R. v. Racine (1977), 32
C.C.C. (2d) 468, at p. 473; Previous Consistent Statements, at pp. 86‑7,
by R. N. Gooderson.

 

From these
authorities, it is my view that the second statement made by Simpson could in
proper circumstances have been admitted in evidence at the request of Simpson.
The Crown, of course, could not have been compelled or directed to tender it.
It remains then to consider whether in the facts of this case the trial judge
should have exercised his discretion by admitting the second statement on the
application of the defence.

 

27.                     I
have read the transcript of the second statement, I have examined the evidence
of the appellants, in chief and in cross‑examination, and I have reached
the conclusion that the second statement is, in general, a statement consistent
with the evidence given by Simpson at his trial. There are discrepancies, but
they assume relatively little significance when the whole of Simpson's evidence
is read with the second statement. The statement is, of course, self‑serving,
but on the whole is consistent with his testimony. It may be that the statement
would be relevant on the issue of Simpson's state of mind when he made it and,
to some extent, when the killing occurred. However, the essence of the second
statement was heard by the jury in the testimony of Simpson and it would shed
little if any light not already found in the viva voce evidence on the actual
killing. The only basis, in my view, upon which it could be said to be
admissible would be to rebut any suggestion by the Crown of recent invention of
a defence by Simpson. The Crown had taken the position that Simpson was a liar
and had illustrated that fact by the introduction of his earlier statement
which stood in marked contrast to his evidence given at trial. In these
circumstances, Simpson would be entitled to have the second statement before
the jury to show that whatever falsehoods he had given the police in his first
statement, he had in his second statement, made some two hours after his
arrest, given the same or substantially the same account of events which he
gave in evidence. In my view, the second statement should have been admitted.

 

Application of s.
613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code 

 

28.                     The
Crown argues that even though the Court might find errors on the part of the
trial judge, it should apply the proviso in s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  and dismiss the appeals. To do so, the Court would have to reach the
conclusion that, while there had been a wrong decision on a question or
questions of law, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.
In the Court of Appeal, Craig J.A. considered that despite the error in
charging the jury on s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code , the case was an
appropriate one for the application of the proviso. Seaton J.A. in his dissent
expressed the view that it should not apply. He said, at p. 542:

 

                   The failure to explain the guilty
plea on the part of the witness Dumoulin is aggravated by the charge under s.
21(2) . In the end the jury could find that Ochs and Simpson conspired with
Dumoulin and L'Ortye and that they formed a common intention to kill Brousseau.
The charge here was not conspiracy, but with the direction under s. 21(2)  it
might well have been. The only difference is that these appellants are
convicted of murder and the witness only of conspiracy.

 

                   When taken with the refusal to admit
Simpson's statement, I am unable to say that s. 613(1) (b)(iii) ought to
be invoked. Simpson's evidence was as important to Ochs' defence as it was to
his own.

 

29.                     The
authoritative statement of the test to be applied by the Court when considering
the application of the proviso in s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  was made by Cartwright J. (as he then was) in Colpitts v. The Queen,
[1965] S.C.R. 739. Speaking for himself and Hall J., he said at p. 744,
referring to the then s. 592(1) (b)(iii) and to various authorities
referred to in the same case by Spence J.:

 

                   A number of authorities which should
guide the Court of Appeal in deciding whether, misdirection having been shewn [sic],
it can safely be affirmed that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
has occurred are quoted in the reasons of my brother Spence. Upon reading these
it will be observed that, once error in law has been found to have occurred at
the trial, the onus resting upon the Crown is to satisfy the Court that the
verdict would necessarily have been the same if such error had not occurred.
The satisfaction of this onus is a condition precedent to the right of the
Appellate Court to apply the terms of the subsection at all. The Court is not
bound to apply the subsection merely because this onus is discharged.

 

Spence J., with
whom Ritchie J. agreed, reviewed many authorities on this question and said, at
p. 755:

 

                   Therefore, this Court must apply the
test set out in the aforesaid cases and, to quote again from Brooks v. The
King:

 

                   The onus is upon the Crown to satisfy
the Court that the jury, charged as it should have been, could not, as
reasonable men, have done otherwise than find the appellant guilty.

 

He added, at p.
756:

 

                   I am of the opinion that this Court
cannot place itself in the position of a jury and weigh these various pieces of
evidence. If there is any possibility that twelve reasonable men, properly
charged, would have a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, then
this Court should not apply the provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) to
affirm a conviction.

 

30.                     The
formulation of the test by Cartwright J. has been followed in later cases and
has been accepted in later decisions of this Court: see Mahoney v. The Queen,
[1982] l S.C.R. 834, at p. 845, in which case reference was also made to the
words of Kerwin J. in Schmidt v. The King, [1945] S.C.R. 438, at p. 440:

 

                   The meaning of these words has been
considered in this Court in several cases, one of which is Gouin v. The King,
[1926] S.C.R. 539, from all of which it is clear that the onus rests on the
Crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict would necessarily have been the
same if the charge had been correct or if no evidence had been improperly
admitted. The principles therein set forth do not differ from the rules set
forth in a recent decision of the House of Lords in Stirland v. Director of
Public Prosecutions, [1944] A.C. 315, i.e., that the proviso that the Court
of Appeal may dismiss the appeal

 

if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of
justice has actually occurred in convicting the accused assumes a situation
where a reasonable jury, after being properly directed, would, on the evidence
properly admissible, without doubt convict.

 

Cartwright J.'s
test has been approved more recently in this Court in Wildman v. The Queen,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 311, where Lamer J., speaking for the Court, dealt with the
matter at pp. 328‑30. Reference may be made as well to Miller and Cockriell,
supra, at pp. 456‑57. The foregoing authorities clearly set out
the test to be applied. The whole of the evidence must be considered and, where
the Court cannot conclude that in the absence of the errors shown to have been
made the result would necessarily have been the same, the proviso cannot be
applied.

 

31.                     Turning
to this case, as to the error in respect of s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code 
it is not possible, in my view, to conclude that the charge under that
subsection could have affected the result. The jury was properly charged under
s. 21(1)  and there was an abundance of evidence before the jury upon which it
could find that both Ochs and Simpson aided in the commission of the crime and,
as well, that they formed a common intent to carry it out. The directions given
regarding s. 21(2)  could not have distracted the jury from the true purpose of
its inquiry. As to the omission of the warning concerning the use of the
evidence of the conviction for conspiracy of Dumoulin, I have already indicated
that I would not consider it reversible error. The defence in this case, it
must be remembered, was not a denial of the killing nor was it a denial of the
planning and preparation for that event. It was that the earlier incriminating
discussions were mere drunk talk and that no intent to carry out the killing of
Dumoulin existed. The defence of drunkenness was raised as well and on that
point a charge was given to which no objection was taken in this Court. The
jury rejected that defence. There was therefore evidence before the jury,
independent of the evidence of Dumoulin's conviction, which standing alone, in
my view, made the conviction of Ochs and Simpson inevitable. As to the refusal
of the trial judge to admit the second or 11:15 a.m. statement by Simpson, it
could not in my view have affected the result. As earlier pointed out, its
essence was before the jury through the evidence of Dumoulin and Ochs and, as
well, the pattern of joint action involving Dumoulin, Ochs, L'Ortye and Simpson
was clearly established before the jury and it would dispel any suggestion that
Simpson had recently invented a defence.

 

32.                     Error
was made at trial and, therefore, if the appeal is to be dismissed, it must be
on the basis of the application of the proviso in s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code . In accordance with the test referred to above, I
would conclude upon a consideration of all the evidence that despite the errors
the result would necessarily have been the same in respect of both appellants.
The only conclusion the jury could have reached on the evidence was that
Simpson and Ochs aided and abetted L'Ortye in the killing. The case in some
respects parallels that of Miller and Cockriell, supra, and the
words of Robertson J.A., speaking for the British Columbia Court of Appeal, at
p. 458, are applicable here:

 

                   Each accused said that he never
intended anything by what he said about shooting a policeman: it was just drunk
talk. This could raise no reasonable doubt, for their deeds belie their
statements: they set out with a rifle, they hunted until they found a policeman
and, when they did, he was shot. Their conduct was entirely consistent with
their expressed intention and fortifies their expression of it; it is equally
inconsistent with an absence of intention.

 

33.                     I
would accordingly apply the proviso and dismiss the appeals.

          Practice ‑‑ Supreme Court of
Canada ‑‑ Introduction of fresh evidence ‑‑ Procedure
to follow.

 

          The appellant was acquitted on a charge
of first degree murder of a nine‑year‑old girl. On appeal, the
Court of Appeal unanimously found (1) that the trial judge erred in his charge
when he invited the jury to apply the criminal standard of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt to individual pieces of evidence; and (2) that he ought to
have directed the jury that certain evidence elicited on the Crown's
examination of the defence psychiatrist, tending to show that both the
perpetrator and the appellant shared abnormal traits, was relevant on the issue
of identity. The Court also rejected appellant's application to admit fresh
evidence, in affidavit form, of the psychiatrist's explanation of the answers
given on examination. This fresh evidence supported the contention that the
evidence was not relevant on the issue of identity. In light of the seriousness
of the errors, the majority of the Court of Appeal ordered a new trial. In this
Court, the appellant submitted that the charge, when read as a whole, did not
invite a piecemeal examination of the evidence and that the Court of Appeal
failed to recognize a two‑stage process in the deliberation of the jury,
each of which attracts the application of the doctrine of reasonable doubt. The
appellant submitted that in the ""fact finding"" stage, the evidence
must be examined in relation to the other evidence but, having been so
examined, it must individually meet the test of proof beyond a reasonable
doubt. At the verdict stage, the jury looks at all the evidence which it has
accepted and determines whether this evidence as a whole establishes the guilt
of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. He also submitted that the evidence
of the psychiatrist on examination did not establish the necessary nexus between
the perpetrator and the appellant to be admissible, if such evidence is ever
admissible for the prosecution; and finally, that the Court of Appeal erred in
dismissing his application to admit fresh evidence.

 

          Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

 

          Per Dickson C.J. and McIntyre, La Forest and Sopinka JJ.: It is
misdirection to instruct the jury to apply the standard of reasonable doubt to
individual pieces of evidence. In this case, the jury would likely have
concluded from the trial judge's charge read as a whole that, in examining the
evidence, they were to give the appellant the benefit of the doubt in respect
of any evidence. The effect of the misdirection may very well have been that
the jury examined evidence that was crucial to the Crown's case in bits and
pieces. Standing alone or pitted against the evidence of the appellant without
the support of other evidence, much of this evidence might have been discarded.
When the jury came to consider the Crown's case as a whole there may not have
been very much left of it. This scenario is a very likely one and the charge
therefore constituted a serious misdirection.

 

          It is also misdirection to instruct the
jury to apply the criminal standard at two stages as submitted. The two‑stage
application of the criminal standard is wrong in principle because the function
of a standard of proof is not the weighing of individual items of evidence but
the determination of ultimate issues. Furthermore, it would require the
individual member of the jury to rely on the same facts in order to establish
guilt. The law is clear on this point: the members of the jury can arrive at
their verdict by different routes and need not rely on the same facts. Indeed,
the jurors need not agree on any single fact except the ultimate conclusion.
During the process of deliberation, the jury must consider the evidence as a
whole and determine whether guilt is established by the prosecution beyond a
reasonable doubt. This of necessity requires that each element of the offence
or issue be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Beyond this injunction, it is for
the trier of fact to determine how to proceed and a trial judge should not lay
down additional rules for the weighing of the evidence. But there are two
exceptions: (1) a jury should be instructed that the facts are not to be
examined separately and in isolation with reference to the criminal standard;
and (2) where issues of credibility arise between the evidence for the
prosecution and the defence, the jury should be charged that it is not
necessary for them to believe the defence evidence on a vital issue but that it
is sufficient if it, viewed in the context of all the evidence, leaves them in
a state of reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt.

 

          The trial judge was right in instructing
the jury that the evidence elicited on the Crown's examination of the defence
psychiatrist was inadmissible as proof of identity. The Court of Appeal erred
in directing a new trial on this ground. Conduct tending to establish that the
appellant is a member of an abnormal group with the same propensities as the
perpetrator is insufficient to render the evidence admissible as similar fact
evidence. There must be some further distinguishing features. The proffered
evidence must tend to show that there was some striking similarity between the
manner in which the perpetrator committed the criminal act and such evidence.
Apart from that requirement, such evidence will also be excluded if its
prejudicial effect overbears its probative value.

 

          The admission of psychiatric evidence
tendered by the Crown tending to show disposition should be subject to the same
test. Accordingly, it is only admissible where it is relevant to an issue in
the case apart from its tendency to show disposition and, if it is relevant to
that issue, where its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect. If the
evidence sole relevance or primary relevance is to show disposition, then the
evidence must be excluded. In order to be relevant on the issue of identity,
the evidence must tend to show that the accused shared a distinctive unusual
behavioural trait with the perpetrator of the crime. The trait must be
sufficiently distinctive that it operates virtually as a badge or mark
identifying the perpetrator. In this case, the fact that the appellant was a
member of an abnormal group, some of whose members have the unusual behavioural
characteristics shown to have been possessed by the perpetrator, was not
sufficient.

 

          Given the conclusion with respect to the
second ground, the ground of appeal relating to the Court of Appeal's refusal
to permit the introduction of fresh evidence need not be considered.
Nevertheless, a party who intends to introduce fresh evidence in the argument
of an appeal in this Court should apply by motion to this Court for an order
admitting the new evidence. The application should be supported by an affidavit
establishing the pre‑conditions for the reception of such evidence. If
this procedure is adopted when the Court of Appeal has refused to hear the
evidence, a motion can be made to this Court in advance of the appeal to
determine whether it will hear the evidence. Nothing is gained by making the
Court of Appeal's refusal a ground of appeal since the criteria for
admissibility of the evidence are precisely the same in this Court as in the
Court of Appeal.

 

          On an appeal from an acquittal, it is
the duty of the Crown to satisfy the court that the verdict would not
necessarily have been the same if the jury had been properly instructed. The
burden is a heavy one and the Crown must satisfy the court with a reasonable
degree of certainty. The charge with respect to the burden of proof lays down
for the jury one of the most fundamental rules of criminal trial process. If
the jury accepted the instruction and examined the evidence separately,
subjecting each item to the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, then
the whole process of decision was distorted and there was no proper trial of
the appellant. Therefore, the Crown discharged the onus. Given the cogency of the
evidence, there was the requisite degree of certainty that the verdict would
not necessarily have been the same if the proper instruction had been given.

 

          Per Lamer and Wilson JJ.: Reasonable doubt plays two distinct roles in the
criminal trial process. First, at the primary level, the facts upon which the
jury rely in order to arrive at a determination of guilt must be established
beyond a reasonable doubt. This means that the jury must be satisfied, within
the context of all the facts of the case, that each of the facts they rely on
for a finding of guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. After looking
at the context of all the facts, if the jury still has a reasonable doubt about
a particular fact, this doubt must be resolved in favour of the accused and
that piece of evidence rejected. At the second level, reasonable doubt operates
in the determination of guilt or innocence. The jury must look at the totality
of the evidence and determine whether on the proved facts, i.e., on those facts
which have survived the scrutiny at the primary level, the accused is guilty.
If there remains a reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt, the doubt must
be resolved in favour of the accused and a verdict of not guilty entered.

 

          In this case, while the trial judge was
correct to direct the jury not to use facts that were not proved beyond a
reasonable doubt in order to found a conviction, he erred in suggesting that
each fact should be assessed in isolation from the others. The trial judge
should have instructed the jury that in their ultimate determination of guilt
they could rely only on facts which, when assessed in the context of all the
facts, they found to have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt; that they must
not make a finding of guilt on doubtful facts; and, that facts, which might
seem doubtful when viewed in isolation, might become completely credible
against the backdrop of all the other facts.

 

          The Court of Appeal erred also on this
point when it indicated that the only thing that must be proved beyond a
reasonable doubt was the guilt of the accused. The implication of the Court of
Appeal's judgment is that the facts underlying this conclusion do not
themselves need to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. This is wrong. It gives
the jury no guidance as to what standard of proof it must apply to the
""fact finding"" exercise. In the absence of direction they might apply
a balance of probabilities or even less stringent test. The jury must be
instructed that in making a determination as to the guilt of the accused they
must have resort only to facts which, when assessed in the context of all the
facts, have been proved to their satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt.

1.           Sopinka J.‑‑This
case illustrates once again the hazards in attempting to amplify the
application of the principle that in a criminal case all elements of the charge
must be proved by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

2.                       On
February 7, 1986, Guy Paul Morin was acquitted on a charge of first degree
murder of Christine Jessop, allegedly committed between October 2, 1984 and
January 1, 1985.

 

3.                       The
appellant entered a plea of not guilty at trial. His position was that he was
not the killer, but in the alternative, if he was the killer he was not guilty
by reason of insanity.

 

4.                       The
evidence at trial was reviewed in some detail in the reasons of the Court of
Appeal, now reported at (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 50 (Ont.), and need not be
repeated here.

 

5.                       The
Crown appealed the acquittal to the Court of Appeal on the basis of two alleged
errors in the charge to the jury. The Court of Appeal was unanimous that the
jury had been misdirected in the following respect:

 

(i) Standard
of Proof

 

6.                       The
trial judge invited the jury to apply the criminal standard of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt to individual pieces of evidence.

 

(ii) Psychiatric
Evidence

 

7.                       That
the trial judge ought to have directed the jury that certain evidence elicited
on examination from a defence psychiatrist, Dr. Orchard, tending to show that
both the perpetrator and the appellant shared abnormal traits, was relevant on
the issue of identity.

 

8.                       The
Court of Appeal did not, however, agree on the disposition of the appeal.
Brooke and Robins JJ.A. were satisfied that the errors warranted a new trial.
Cory J.A. was not satisfied that the Crown had established that the verdict
would not necessarily have been the same if the jury had been properly
instructed.

 

9.                       In
the result, a new trial was directed and that decision is challenged in this
appeal.

 

10.                     In
outline the submission of the appellant on these two points is:

 

(i) Standard
of Proof

 

11.                     Mr.
Ruby submitted that the charge as a whole did not invite a piecemeal
examination of the evidence. The Court of Appeal erred in failing to recognize
a two‑stage process in the deliberation of the jury, each of which
attracts the application of the doctrine of reasonable doubt. During the first,
or ""fact finding"" stage, the jury determines ""what
happened"". The evidence must be examined in relation to the other evidence
but, having been so examined, it must individually meet the test of proof
beyond a reasonable doubt. Only evidence that does so is considered at the next
stage.

 

12.                     The
second is the guilty, or verdict, stage during which the jury looks at all the
evidence which it has accepted and determines whether this evidence as a whole
establishes the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. It is submitted
by the appellant that the charge to the jury was in accordance with the
foregoing.

 

(ii) Psychiatric
Evidence

 

13.                     Mr.
Code submitted that the evidence of Dr. Orchard on examination did not
establish the necessary nexus between the perpetrator and the appellant to be
admissible, if such evidence is ever admissible for the prosecution. The
evidence obtained did not go beyond evidence of mere disposition and is
excluded on policy grounds.

 

14.                     Furthermore,
even if the evidence possessed the necessary ingredients to establish some
nexus between the killer and the appellant, the Court of Appeal erred in
failing to balance its probative value as against its prejudicial effect.

 

15.                     In
aid of this ground an application had been made to the Court of Appeal to admit
fresh evidence in the form of an affidavit of Dr. Orchard explaining the
answers given on examination. The Court of Appeal rejected this application
without hearing the fresh evidence. The appellant says the Court of Appeal
erred and the refusal is put forward as a ground of appeal.

 

Factual
Background

 

16.                     Although
a detailed review of the evidence is neither necessary nor, in the
circumstances, desirable, a few brief extracts will serve to make the issues
more intelligible. The Crown relied, inter alia, on the following
evidence:

 

(i)     hair
embedded in tissue on a silver chain around the deceased's neck was analyzed
scientifically and found to match the hair of the appellant;

 

(ii)    several
hairs in the appellant's car were similarly matched with the hair of Christine
Jessop. The appellant denied that Christine Jessop was ever in his car;

 

(iii)   certain
fibres and animal hairs found at the murder scene were matched with fibre and
animal hairs found in the appellant's car or residence;

 

(iv)    statements
alleged to have been made by the appellant to one Hobbs, an undercover officer,
from which an inference of guilt might be drawn and appellant's demonstration
in the Whitby jail in May 1985 of how he repeatedly stabbed his victim;

 

(v)     the
appellant's admissions and inculpatory statements to two cell‑mates,
Leyte and May, in the Whitby jail.

 

17.                     The
appellant disputed the significance of the expert evidence relating to the
samples of hair and fibre. The evidence of Hobbs, Leyte and May was forcefully
attacked on the grounds of inaccuracy and lack of credibility. The appellant
also put forward an alibi defence, the gist of which was that after leaving
work he went shopping and did not return home until after Christine Jessop
disappeared.

 

18.                     With
respect to the alternative defence of insanity, the appellant called
psychiatric evidence including that of Dr. Orchard, a forensic psychiatrist. It
was during the examination of this witness by Crown counsel, Mr. Scott, that
the evidence which gave rise to the second ground of appeal was elicited.

 

First
Ground: Alleged Misdirection Concerning the Standard of Proof

 

19.                     The
appellant submits that the charge, when read as a whole, did not invite the
jury to subject individual pieces of evidence to the criminal standard but
rather the effect of the charge was that during the ""fact finding""
stage items of evidence were to be examined in relation to other evidence. The
residuum resulting from this process constitutes the ""whole of the
evidence"" from which the jury determines whether guilt has been proved
beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

20.                     This
argument raises two questions:

 

(i)     Is
the appellant's interpretation of the charge correct?

 

(ii)    Assuming
it is, is it misdirection to instruct the jury to apply the criminal standard
at two stages as submitted?

 

21.                     The
appellant does not contest that it is misdirection to instruct the jury to
apply the standard of reasonable doubt to individual pieces of evidence. There
is ample authority for this view: Stewart v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R.
748, at pp. 759‑61; R. v. Bouvier (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 257
(Ont. C.A.), at p. 265, aff'd [1985] 2 S.C.R. 485.

 

22.                     The
following are the relevant excerpts from the charge to the jury set out in the
order in which they occurred:

 

1. Concerning
Evidence

 

        You are not obliged to accept any part of the
evidence of a witness just because there is no denial of it. If you have a
reasonable doubt about any of the evidence you will give the benefit of that
doubt to the accused with respect to such evidence. Having decided what
evidence you consider worthy of belief, you will consider it as a whole, of
course, in arriving at your verdict. [Emphasis added.]

 

2. Concerning
Burden of Proof

 

The accused is entitled to the benefit of reasonable
doubt on the whole of the case and on each and every issue in the case.

 

        Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not apply
to the individual items of evidence or the separate pieces of evidence in the
case, but to the total body of evidence upon which the Crown relies to prove
guilt. Before you can convict you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
of his guilt.

 

3. Concerning
Hairs and Fibres

 

        It seems to me that this evidence does not go
beyond proving that Christine could have been in the Honda motor vehicle and
that the accused could have been at the scene of the killing and, of course,
that is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

4. Concerning
Appellant's Statements to Hobbs

 

        I was going to go on to say that if you find
that the evidence of the accused at trial here represents the correct
interpretation of those tapes and transcripts, or parts of the tapes and
transcripts, or if you have a reasonable doubt that that might be so, you will
give him the benefit of the doubt as to those parts of the tapes or transcripts
and adopt his interpretation.

 

 

5.      Concerning
Appellant's Statement to Inmate May

 

        Now, as to that evidence in relation to that
part of the tape that I have just read, if you find the evidence of the accused
at trial represents the correct interpretation of that exchange, or if you have
a reasonable doubt that that may be so, you will give the benefit of the doubt
to the accused and adopt his interpretation.

 

23.                     In
my opinion, based on my reading of the charge as a whole, a jury would likely
have concluded that in examining the evidence they were to give the accused the
benefit of the doubt in respect of any evidence. This process of
examination and elimination would occur during the so‑called ""fact
finding"" stage, to use the appellant's phrase. The evidence as a whole to
which the jury was to apply itself in order to determine guilt or innocence was
the residuum after the ""fact finding"" stage. There is no other way of
reading the first excerpt from the charge.

 

24.                     The
appellant contends, however, that the second excerpt corrected this error. Cory
J.A. agreed that it and the instruction as to alibi ""do much to rectify
the errors made on this subject"" (p. 62). The second excerpt refers
to the ""whole of the case"" and the ""total body of
evidence"". Having been told earlier that the ""whole"" upon which
the verdict was to be based consisted of the evidence that had been accepted, I
am not satisfied that the jury would have interpreted this passage as a correction.
Rather, they might very well have assumed that the earlier definition of the
""whole"" still applied. At best, from the appellant's standpoint the
jury would be confused. Subsequent passages in the charge illustrate what is
meant by the first excerpt and would confirm that individual pieces of evidence
were to be examined by reference to the criminal standard.

 

25.                     Excerpt
3 occurs after a review of the evidence relating to the hair and fibres. The
appellant suggests that this observation by the trial judge is merely
descriptive of the inference that can be drawn from the evidence. In my
opinion, in light of what was said in the first excerpt, the jury would
conclude that the appellant was to be given the benefit of the doubt and this
evidence was not to be considered as part of the whole in arriving at the
jury's verdict.

 

26.                     Excerpt
4 deals with the evidence of undercover officer Hobbs and the appellant's
interpretation of what was said. Hobbs' version might have been strengthened in
the minds of the jury if considered along with other evidence, in particular
the evidence of Leyte and May. These two cell‑mates gave evidence about
statements and actions of the appellant tending to incriminate him. This
passage in the charge invited the jury to pit the evidence of Hobbs in
isolation against that of the appellant. If the evidence of the appellant put
the evidence of Hobbs in doubt, then by reason of the instruction in the first
excerpt, this evidence was to be rejected in favour of the appellant's
interpretation which was not inculpatory.

 

27.                     The
instruction in excerpt 5 invited the jury to deal with the evidence of cell‑mate
May in the same manner, with the same result.

 

28.                     The
appellant submits, citing R. v. Challice (1979), 45 C.C.C. (2d) 546
(Ont. C.A.), that different considerations apply where the credibility of
defence evidence is at issue. In such cases the argument is that the defence
evidence does not have to be believed but ""only has to raise a reasonable
doubt"". That does not mean, however, that the defence evidence or the evidence
which it contradicts or explains is to be examined piecemeal. The judgment of
Morden J.A. in Challice, supra, which the appellant agrees
expresses the traditional view and is consistent with the judgment of this
Court in Nadeau v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 570, and R. v. Thatcher,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 652, correctly states the law in the following passage (at
p. 557):

 

        Understandably, a jury have to give careful
consideration to issues of credibility when deliberating upon their verdict,
and with respect to various pieces of evidence they may have differing views:
total acceptance, total rejection, or something in between. An effective and
desirable way of recognizing this necessary part of the process, and putting it
to the jury in a way that accurately comports with their duty respecting the
burden and standard of proof, is to instruct the jury that it is not necessary
for them to believe the defence evidence on a vital issue‑‑but that
it is sufficient if it, viewed in the context of all the evidence, leaves
them in a state of reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt: see R. v.
Lobell, [1957] 1 Q.B. 547 at p. 551, per Lord Goddard, C.J.
[Emphasis added.]

 

29.                     Nothing
in Nadeau, supra, supports the appellant's submission. In that
case the trial judge charged the jury in effect that they should accept either
the Crown's version of the facts or that of the accused. He added that the
accused was entitled to the benefit of the doubt only if the versions were
equally consistent with the evidence. The judgment of Lamer J. makes it plain
that the accused's version is entitled to the benefit of the doubt unless when
considered in light of all the evidence the jury is satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the Crown's version is correct. He said (at p. 573):

 

The jurors cannot accept his [a Crown witness'] version,
or any part of it, unless they are satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt, having
regard to all the evidence, that the events took place in this manner;
otherwise, the accused is entitled, unless a fact has been established beyond a
reasonable doubt, to the finding of fact the most favourable to him, provided
of course that it is based on evidence in the record and not mere speculation.
[Emphasis added.]

 

30.                     There
is nothing in the judgment in the Thatcher case which is inconsistent
with this view.

 

31.                     The
effect of the misdirections referred to above may very well have been that the
jury examined evidence that was crucial to the Crown's case in bits and pieces.
Standing alone or pitted against the evidence of the accused without the
support of other evidence, much of this evidence might have been discarded as
not measuring up to the test. When the jury came to consider the Crown's case
as a whole there may not have been very much left of it. We cannot know for
certain, but this scenario is a very likely one and the charge therefore
constituted a serious misdirection.

 

32.                     This
conclusion is sufficient to dispose of this ground of appeal without addressing
the second point in the appellant's argument: the submission that it is a correct
instruction to a jury that they are to apply the criminal standard in two
stages‑‑the fact finding stage and the verdict, or guilt, stage.
Since, however, it was an attempt to do so by the trial judge that led to the
difficulties in the charge, I propose to consider this point.

 

33.                     The
authorities reviewed above are clear that the jury is not to examine the
evidence piecemeal by reference to the criminal standard. Otherwise, there is
virtually no guidance in previous cases as to what legal rules, if any, apply
to the process of weighing the evidence. Attempts to formulate such rules have
been frowned upon. Thus, in R. v. Van Beelen (1973), 4 S.A.S.R. 353
(S.C. in banco), a case heavily relied on by the appellant, the full
Court of South Australia held that in finding the facts the jury could not draw
an inference of guilt from several facts whose existence was in doubt. The
learned author of Cross on Evidence (6th ed. 1985), in referring to this
case characterizes this as an esoteric question and concludes (at p. 146):

 

Whatever may be the proper direction in the
circumstances of a particular case, it is to be hoped that questions such as
those which have just been raised will never be allowed to become the basis of
prescribed rules.

 

34.                     A
case which comes closest in grappling with this problem is Thomas v. The
Queen, [1972] N.Z.L.R. 34 (C.A.) The trial judge charged the jury in the
following language (at p. 36):

 

Now whilst each piece of evidence must be carefully
examined, because that is the accused's right and that is your duty, the case
is not decided by a series of separate and exclusive judgments on each item or
by asking what does that by itself prove, or does it prove guilt? That is not
the process at all. It is the cumulative effect . . . . [Emphasis
added by the Court of Appeal.]

 

35.                     Counsel
for the appellant in that case contended that the jury should be instructed to
proceed in a series of separate steps to examine the evidence and eliminate
that which did not meet the requisite standard. This submission was answered as
follows by North P. (at p. 37):

 

        If we have understood Mr Temm's argument
correctly, it is the passage in the summing‑up which we have italicised
that he challenges. As the argument proceeded, it became increasingly plain to
us that the premise for his propositions was based on a misconception of the
respective functions of the Judge and the jury in a criminal case. It is the
duty and obligation of the Judge to instruct the jury on all matters of law,
including the burden and standard of proof required in criminal cases. The
facts, on the other hand, are for the jury, and while the Judge may think it right
to give the jury some assistance in dealing with the facts, it is no part of
his duty to tell the jury that each item of evidence must be weighed by them
separately, and that they must decide that it has been proved beyond reasonable
doubt before they can use it in reaching their verdict. It is for the jury to
determine for themselves which parts of the evidence they are prepared to
accept or to reject. What Mr Temm apparently sought in vain at the trial and
now sought to support in this Court, was, what he claimed as the appellant's
right to a direction instructing the jury to proceed by a series of separate
steps, eliminating as they proceeded on their intellectual journey every fact
which, considered by itself, raised more than one inference, so that in the end
the jury should consider only those facts and inferences which in themselves
proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty.

 

        The Crown case in this instance was built up of
a number of separate ingredients, which it was contended acquired a meaning in
the context of the indictment, only when examined with proper regard to the
interrelation of the constituent elements.

 

36.                     The
argument in favour of a two‑stage application of the criminal standard
has superficial appeal in theory but in my respectful opinion is wrong in
principle and unworkable in practice. In principle it is wrong because the
function of a standard of proof is not the weighing of individual items of
evidence but the determination of ultimate issues. Furthermore, it would
require the individual member of the jury to rely on the same facts in order to
establish guilt. The law is clear that the members of the jury can arrive at
their verdict by different routes and need not rely on the same facts. Indeed
the jurors need not agree on any single fact except the ultimate conclusion.
See Wigmore on Evidence (Chadbourn rev. 1981), vol. 9, § 2497, at
pp. 412‑14; R. v. Lynch, Malone and King (1978), 40 C.C.C.
(2d) 7 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 19; R. v. Bouvier (Ont. C.A.), supra,
at pp. 264‑65; R. v. Moreau (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 359 (Ont.
C.A.), at p. 389; R. v. Agbim, [1979] Crim. L.R. 171 (C.A.); R.
v. Thatcher (1986), 24 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Sask. C.A.), at p. 510, appeal
dismissed, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 652, at p. 697.

 

37.                     The
matter is summed up in Cross on Evidence, op. cit., at p. 146:

 

        It has been held by the Court of Appeal that it
is unnecessary for a judge to direct the jury that it must be unanimous with
regard to even one item of evidence bearing upon a particular count before
convicting on it. It seems to be enough that all members of the jury find the
accused guilty upon the basis of some of the facts bearing upon that count.

 

38.                     In
practice it is not practical not only because the jury would have to agree on
the same facts but what individual facts prove. Individual facts do not
necessarily establish guilt but are a link in the chain of ultimate proof. It
is not possible therefore to require the jury to find facts proved beyond a
reasonable doubt without identifying what it is that they prove beyond a
reasonable doubt. Since the same fact may give rise to different inferences
tending to establish guilt or innocence, the jury might discard such facts on
the basis that there is doubt as to what they prove.

 

39.                     The
concern which proponents of the two‑stage process express is, that facts
which are doubtful will be used to establish guilt. The answer to this concern
is that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. If facts which are
essential to a finding of guilt are still doubtful notwithstanding the support
of other facts, this will produce a doubt in the mind of the jury that guilt
has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

40.                     I
conclude from the foregoing that the facts are for the jury to determine
subject to an instruction by the trial judge as to the law. While the charge
may and often does include many helpful tips on the weighing of evidence such
as observing demeanour, taking into the account the interest of the witness and
so forth, the law lays down only one basic requirement: during the process of
deliberation the jury or other trier of fact must consider the evidence as a
whole and determine whether guilt is established by the prosecution beyond a
reasonable doubt. This of necessity requires that each element of the offence
or issue be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Beyond this injunction it is for
the trier of fact to determine how to proceed. To intrude in this area is, as
pointed out by North P., an intrusion into the province of the jury.

 

41.                     The
reason we have juries is so that lay persons and not lawyers decide the facts.
To inject into the process artificial legal rules with respect to the natural
human activity of deliberation and decision would tend to detract from the
value of the jury system. Accordingly, it is wrong for a trial judge to lay
down additional rules for the weighing of the evidence. Indeed, it is unwise to
attempt to elaborate on the basic requirement referred to above. I would make
two exceptions. The jury should be told that the facts are not to be examined
separately and in isolation with reference to the criminal standard. This
instruction is a necessary corollary to the basic rule referred to above.
Without it there is some danger that a jury might conclude that the requirement
that each issue or element of the offence be proved beyond a reasonable doubt
demands that individual items of evidence be so proved.

 

42.                     The
second exception is that it is appropriate where issues of credibility arise
between the evidence for the prosecution and the defence that the jury be
charged as suggested by Morden J.A. in Challice, supra. There is a
danger in such a situation that a jury might conclude that it is simply a
matter as to which side they believe. The suggested charge alerts them to the
fact that, if the defence evidence leaves them in a state of doubt after
considering it in the context of the whole of the evidence, then they are to
acquit.

 

43.                     Consequently,
even if the appellant is correct in his interpretation of the charge to the
jury, there was misdirection‑‑although not as serious as the
misdirection which I have found occurred.

 

Second
Ground: The Psychiatric Evidence

 

44.                     The
Court of Appeal accepted the submission of the prosecution that the trial judge
had misdirected the jury when he charged them as follows:

 

        One more thing I must tell you about this
psychiatric evidence. There is contained in that evidence, I believe, particularly
from Dr. Orchard, that the accused is a person who is quite capable of
committing the type of crime we are considering in this case. I instruct you
that you must not use that evidence as proof or indication of proof that he
did, in fact, kill Christine Jessop just because he is capable of it.

 

45.                     The
evidence referred to was elicited on the examination of Dr. Orchard by Mr.
Scott, counsel for the Crown. The purport of this evidence is vital in the
resolution of this ground of appeal. It is, therefore, necessary to quote it at
some length:

 

        Q. [Mr. Scott] I take it by the very fact
that you are capable of expressing an opinion on what condition this man would
be in, in the event that he sexually assaulted ‑‑ raped
and stabbed many times Christine Jessop, that you must be of the opinion that
he has the psychological make‑up to commit such an offence.

 

        A. No, I am of the opinion that, in fact,
the illness ‑ and if he did that ‑‑ did disturb his
psychological make‑up so that he could do such an act.

 

        HIS LORDSHIP: Excuse me. I didn't get that. Your
answer was ""No . . ."" what, Doctor?

 

        THE WITNESS: No. The illness very likely
did ‑‑ could have or very likely did disturb his
psychological make‑up to the point that he could commit such an offence.
I didn't feel that he had necessarily the psychological make‑up to molest
children.

 

                          ...

 

        Q. Coming back to where we started about
capacity and your responses to certain hypotheticals, I am suggesting to you
the man sitting there, on what you have told us in this Court, is a man that
has mental problems, who is capable of raping and of stabbing multiply an
individual. Isn't that correct?

 

        A. He is capable of forcing intercourse and
stabbing multiply a person if he did that, yes, he is capable of it.

 

        Q. With a 40 pound girl, a nine year old.

 

        A. Yes.

 

        Q. Now, you talked of schizophrenia. I
suggest to you that the broad range of schizophrenics would not be so capable,
would they?

 

        A. Well, the majority of people with
schizophrenia don't get into violent behaviour, but some of them do. So the
majority of cases of schizophrenia would not be involved in this kind of
behaviour. The point is I don't know whether he was involved in the behaviour
or not, but I do know about the illness.

 

        Q. You know that this illness is such that
it would permit him to do that to that nine year old, don't you?

 

        A. Yes.

 

        Q. And I am suggesting to you that the number
who could do that to a nine year old is minuscule.

 

        A. That is true.

 

        Q. That this man is something special,
isn't he?

 

        A. Yes. It is not a usual kind of thing,
not a common kind of thing, so yes, in that way it is unusual.

 

        Q. It could only be an offence committed by
a member of an abnormal group. Isn't that correct?

 

        A. Well, almost, at any rate. I never say
""only"" or ""never"" or ""always"" because that's when
I am wrong, but I would say in the vast, vast majority of cases such an offence
would likely be committed by somebody who had some sort of pretty strong
abnormality; a serious abnormality.

 

        Q. Are not the psychiatric disorders that
you are describing that this man has, similar to what you would expect to find
in terms of the scene that has unfolded before you on Exhibit 8, an isolated
area, sexual assault of a nine year old left with her clothes askew, stabbed
many times?

 

        A. Yes, certainly. I don't know‑‑first
of all sexual assault of a nine year old, if it was attempting to force
intercourse, would be pretty unusual because that is not a thing that a nine
year old is usually attractive for. They usually are not developed to the point
that they are usual sexual objects. Stabbed many times is often a sign that
there is something strange going on. If somebody wants to kill somebody they
can usually do it without doing it many times. They can usually manage not to
sort of continue on in the activity.

 

        Q. That is a sign of disorganization, isn't
it?

 

        A. Yes, it is.

 

        Q. Multiple stab wounds on the chest and
back are clearly an indication of a very disorganized crime, aren't they?

 

        A. Yes.

 

        Q. And particularly when you look at it as
being a 40 pound, nine year old person, the victim.

 

                          ...

 

        Q. So they are able to come here, get in
the witness stand and say ""Not me""?

 

        A. Yes, that could happen.

 

        Q. And that is, again, a classic symptom of
the disease which that man, Morin, has, isn't it?

 

        A. Yes.

 

        Q. So I am a little surprised that you
indicate that you are surprised that he denied it. Why would you be at all
surprised about that, Doctor?

 

        A. I don't know that I am surprised that he
denied it. I just say that when someone is able to take me through their memory
and their mental processes about a certain time, then I can draw a conclusion
from that. When a person does not have that available, then I can't draw
conclusions from what he tells me about the incident or about the particular
time. I have to draw conclusions from my diagnosis. That is what the difficulty
is, you see. I don't know; I have nothing in my interviews with him that I
could say, ""Ah, yes, he did this"", but I did have an illness. Whether
he did it or not, that is up to somebody else to decide, that is not for me
because I have nothing that can add to that one way or the other, except
that there is this illness.

 

                          ...

 

        Q. And the second thing you can add is that
in your opinion that man is the type of man who could commit this crime.

 

        A. Yes, that is possible with this
illness, that happens with this illness.

 

        Q. That is very helpful, isn't it, sir, in
terms of assessing a situation?

 

        A. Whoever hears it will have to decide
whether that is helpful.

 

        Q. Then you went a third step and
indicated ‑‑ I think you indicated that there would be a
very small, small area of the population that could be capable of such a crime,
didn't you?

 

        A. Yes, it is not a common thing. [Emphasis
added.]

 

46.                     The
Court of Appeal held that this evidence was admissible on the issue of
identity. At page 66 of his reasons (concurred in by Robins and Brooke JJ.A.,
on this point), Cory J.A. stated:

 

The critical psychiatric evidence, called as it was on
behalf of the respondent and going as it did to identify the perpetrator of the
crime, was admissible on the issue of identity notwithstanding the prejudicial
effect it might have had upon the respondent: see R. v. Glynn, [infra].

 

47.                     The
impugned passage from the charge was preceded by submission by both sides with
respect to the issue and resulted in the following ruling:

 

On the issue of insanity there was considerable
psychiatric evidence to the effect that the accused is a person with a mental
illness and that he is so constituted that he is quite capable of committing
the crime in question, that is sexual assault and killing. However, unless I
change my mind between now and tomorrow when I charge the jury, I will be
instructing the jury that that evidence should not be used as proof that the
accused did, in fact, kill Christine Jessop. There may be more than one
reason for that conclusion, but at the moment it is sufficient for me to say
that there is no evidence in this case that this crime could only be committed
by a person with the mental characteristics of the accused. [Emphasis
added.]

 

48.                     In
my opinion the trial judge was right in concluding that the evidence was not
admissible as proof of identity.

 

49.                     Cory
J.A. arrived at his conclusion that the evidence was admissible by reviewing
certain authorities from which he developed a list of five criteria (p. 64).
He then concluded the evidence of Dr. Orchard referred to above met these
criteria.

 

50.                     The
authorities reviewed by His Lordship dealt with two categories of evidence:

 

(i)     similar
fact evidence; and

 

(ii)    psychiatric
evidence tendered by accused persons to exclude the accused from membership in
a special abnormal group to which the perpetrator is shown to have belonged.

 

51.                     I
propose to review these cases and determine whether the principles which emerge
from them support the conclusion of the Court of Appeal.

 

(i) Similar
Facts

 

52.                     In
similar fact cases it is not sufficient to establish that the accused is a
member of an abnormal group with the same propensities as the perpetrator.
There must be some further distinguishing feature. Accordingly, if the crime
was committed by someone with homosexual tendencies, it is not sufficient to
establish that the accused is a practising homosexual or indeed has engaged in
numerous homosexual acts. The tendered evidence must tend to show that there
was some striking similarity between the manner in which the perpetrator
committed the criminal act and such evidence. To quote from Director of
Public Prosecutions v. Boardman, [1975] A.C. 421 (H.L.), at p. 454, per
Lord Hailsham:

 

...whilst it would certainly not be enough to identify
the culprit in a series of burglaries that he climbed in through a ground floor
window, the fact that he left the same humorous limerick on the walls of the
sitting room, or an esoteric symbol written in lipstick on the mirror, might
well be enough. In a sex case, to adopt an example given in argument in the
Court of Appeal, whilst a repeated homosexual act by itself might be quite
insufficient to admit the evidence as confirmatory of identity or design, the
fact that it was alleged to have been performed wearing the ceremonial head‑dress
of a Red Indian chief or other eccentric garb might well in appropriate
circumstances suffice.

 

53.                     Similarly
in R. v. Taylor (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 437, evidence that the accused
was a practising homosexual was rejected by the Ontario Court of Appeal
notwithstanding that the assault in issue was a homosexual act.

 

54.                     Apart
from the requirement that the proffered evidence tends to show that the accused
shared some distinctive feature with the perpetrator, such evidence will be
excluded if its prejudicial effect overbears its probative value. The admission
of similar facts is an exception to an exclusionary rule of evidence which
rules out evidence of past misconduct which would tend to show that the accused
had the propensity to commit the crime. As pointed out by Lamer J. in Morris
v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 190, this rule of exclusion evolved as a
result of the repeated exercise of a judicial discretion excluding such
evidence because its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect
(p. 201). In considering whether an exception should be made, regard must
be had for the underlying rationale of the exclusionary rule: does the
prejudicial effect of the evidence outweigh its probative value? An exception
should be made if the scales tip in favour of probative value. In Morris,
supra, Lamer J. expressed this principle as follows (at p. 202):

 

        This is not to say that evidence which is
relevant to a given issue in a case will of necessity be excluded merely
because it also tends to prove disposition. Such evidence will be admitted
subject to the judge weighing its probative value to that issue (e.g.,
identity), also weighing its prejudicial effect, and then determining its
admissibility by measuring one to the other. The degree of probative value
required to overcome the exclusionary rule is presently the object of some
disagreement and the law is as a result somewhat unclear. We do not need
consider this aspect of the rule at any length as the facts of this case do not
bring us within the exception.

 

55.                     This
principle was reaffirmed by La Forest J. (speaking for the majority in this
respect) in R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670. La Forest J. referred to
the cardinal principle of our law of evidence to exclude otherwise relevant
evidence if it ""may unduly prejudice, mislead or confuse the trier of
fact . . ."" (p. 714).

 

56.                     Reference
was also made to R. v. Glynn (1971), 5 C.C.C. (2d) 364 (Ont. C.A.)
(leave to appeal refused, [1971] S.C.R. ix), a case in which a murder had
apparently been committed by a person with homosexual tendencies. Evidence of
previous homosexual acts on the part of the accused were admitted on the issue
of identity. That case appears to conflict with Boardman, supra,
and indeed with the decision in Taylor, supra. The court in Glynn
was very much impressed by the analogy to a case in which it is shown that the
crime was committed by a left‑handed person. In such circumstances
clearly evidence would be admissible that the accused was left‑handed.
The analogy is not apt because the evidence of the accused's physical state is
not evidence showing propensity or disposition and therefore is not subject to
the policy against the reception of such evidence unless its probative value
outweighs its prejudicial effect.

 

(ii)    Psychiatric
Evidence Tendered by the Defence

 

57.                     Cases
such as R. v. Lupien, [1970] S.C.R. 263; R. v. McMillan (1975),
23 C.C.C. (2d) 160 (Ont. C.A.), aff'd [1977] 2 S.C.R. 824, and R. v.
Robertson (1975), 21 C.C.C. (2d) 385 (Ont. C.A.) (leave to appeal refused,
[1975] 1 S.C.R. xi), were cases in which psychiatric evidence was tendered by
the defence. The distinction was aptly put by Spence J. in McMillan (at
p. 828) affirming the judgment of Martin J.A.:

 

        I further agree...that when such evidence is
adduced by the defence there is no policy preventing its admission such as the
requirement of fairness to the accused which applies to prevent its being
adduced by the Crown.

 

58.                     This
passage suggests that such evidence is never admissible when tendered by the
Crown even if it is relevant to some issue.

 

59.                     Martin
J.A. reiterated this proposition in R. v. Speid (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d)
534. He said (at p. 545):

 

Such evidence is, however, excluded by a rule of policy
when proffered by the Crown against the accused, notwithstanding its relevance.
It was not suggested by Crown counsel that the appellant had put his
disposition in issue enabling the Crown to rebut an assertion that he was of
non‑violent disposition: see R. v. McMillan, supra.

 

60.                     On
the other hand, the Court of Appeal treated the matter as if the only question
was whether the evidence had relevance to some other issue, in this case,
identity. For instance, Cory J.A. said (at p. 66):

 

        The Crown, however, did not seek to refer to the
evidence on the issue of propensity but rather on the issue of identity. The
evidence was relevant and significant on the question of the identity of the
killer of Christine Jessop, and on that issue it was admissible.

 

61.                     In
my opinion, the correct view lies in between these two positions. The evidence
should not always be excluded, but neither should it necessarily be admitted
because it is relevant to an issue. It seems to me that the policy against the
admission of such evidence is satisfied if its probative value exceeds its
prejudicial effect. On the other hand, the mere fact** that the evidence has some
relevance does not secure its admissibility if it does not meet this test.

 

62.                     It
is illogical to treat evidence tending to show the accused's propensity to
commit the crime differently because such propensity is introduced by expert
evidence rather than by means of past similar conduct. If in the latter case
the evidence is admitted provided its probative value exceeds its prejudicial
effect, then the same test of admissibility should apply in the former case.

 

63.                     Accordingly,
when the prosecution tenders expert psychiatric evidence, the trial judge must
determine whether it is relevant to an issue in the case apart from its
tendency to show propensity. If it is relevant to another issue (e.g.
identity), it must then be determined whether its probative value on that other
issue outweighs its prejudicial effect on the propensity question. In sum, if
the evidence's sole relevance or primary relevance is to show
disposition, then the evidence must be excluded.

 

64.                     It
is difficult and arguably undesirable to lay down stringent rules for the
determination of the relevance of a particular category of evidence. Relevance
is very much a function of the other evidence and issues in a case. Attempts in
the past to define the criteria for the admission of similar facts have not met
with much success (see Cross on Evidence, op. cit., at pp. 310‑11).
The test must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the varying circumstances
in which it must be applied.

 

65.                     In
my opinion, in order to be relevant on the issue of identity the evidence must
tend to show that the accused shared a distinctive unusual behavioural trait
with the perpetrator of the crime. The trait must be sufficiently distinctive
that it operates virtually as a badge or mark identifying the perpetrator. The
judgment of Lord Hailsham in Boardman, quoted above, provides one
illustration of the kind of evidence that would be relevant.

 

66.                     Similarly,
psychiatric evidence that the male accused had a strong inclination to choke
his female partner during intercourse would be relevant on the issue of
identity in a murder case in which death ensued to the female victim as a
result of strangulation during intercourse with the perpetrator.

 

67.                     Conversely,
the fact that the accused is a member of an abnormal group some of the members
of which have the unusual behavioural characteristics shown to have been
possessed by the perpetrator is not sufficient. In some cases it may, however,
be shown that all members of the group have the distinctive unusual
characteristics. If a reasonable inference can be drawn that the accused has
those traits then the evidence is relevant subject to the trial judge's
obligation to exclude it if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative
value. The greater the number of persons in society having these tendencies,
the less relevant the evidence on the issue of identity and the more likely
that its prejudicial effect predominates over its probative value.

 

68.                     The
evidence of Dr. Orchard referred to above amounts to no more than this. The
appellant is a simple schizophrenic. A small percentage of simple
schizophrenics have the tendency or capability of committing the crime in
question in the abnormal fashion in which it was committed. There is no
evidence that the appellant has these tendencies or capability unless one
assumes, as Dr. Orchard was asked to do, that the appellant committed the
crime. Accordingly the learned trial judge was right when he ruled that the
evidence was not admissible as proof that the appellant did, in fact, kill
Christine Jessop. There was, therefore, no error at trial in this respect.

 

Fresh
Evidence

 

69.                     In
view of the conclusion reached with respect to the second ground, it is
unnecessary to deal with the ground of appeal relating to the refusal by the
Court of Appeal to permit the introduction of fresh evidence. This evidence was
designed to explain the testimony of Dr. Orchard referred to above in order to
support the contention that it was not relevant.

 

70.                     In
view of the procedure adopted by the appellant in this case and the absence of
any guidance in the rules or authorities as to the practice in this Court in
respect of this matter, I propose to make a few observations which I hope will
be helpful. This is not intended as a criticism of counsel in this case.

 

71.                     In
R. v. Stolar, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 480, McIntyre J. has dealt exhaustively
with the procedure to be followed in the Court of Appeal when fresh evidence is
sought to be introduced under s. 610  of the Criminal Code . Stolar
was a case in which the fresh evidence was tendered in aid of an order for a
new trial on the basis that its availability at trial could reasonably have
affected the verdict.

 

72.                     The
fresh evidence in this appeal was not sought for that purpose but in aid of a
submission that there should not be a new trial. The Court of Appeal
dismissed the application. As pointed out by McIntyre J. in Stolar, at
p. 491, they are empowered to do so. Indeed, that is the correct course
where the conditions for the introduction of fresh evidence are absent. This
Court was not given the same opportunity by reason of the procedure adopted.
The refusal of the Court of Appeal was made a ground of appeal, the fresh
evidence of Dr. Orchard was included in the Case on Appeal (apparently by
agreement between counsel), referred to in the appellant's factum and during
oral argument, all as if the Court had ruled that it would hear the evidence.

 

73.                     I
can understand the appellant's dilemma. If reference was to be made to the
evidence during the argument of this appeal it would not await a determination
of that ground of appeal unless that ground was argued first and disposed of
before the rest of the appeal was heard.

 

74.                     In
order to solve this dilemma, a party who intends to introduce fresh evidence in
the argument of an appeal in this Court should apply by motion to this Court
for an order admitting the new evidence. The application should be supported by
an affidavit establishing the pre‑conditions for the reception of such
evidence (see Stolar, supra, and Palmer v. The Queen,
[1980] 1 S.C.R. 759). No such affidavit was filed by the appellant in this
Court, nor apparently in the Court of Appeal.

 

75.                     If
this procedure is adopted when the Court of Appeal has refused to hear the
evidence, a motion can be made to this Court in advance of the appeal to
determine whether it will hear the evidence. Nothing is gained by making the
Court of Appeal's refusal a ground of appeal since the criteria for
admissibility of the evidence are precisely the same in this Court as in the
Court of Appeal.

 

Disposition

 

76.                     What
consequences flow from the finding of misdirection on ground one but not ground
two?

 

77.                     In
the Court of Appeal, Cory J.A. would not have directed a new trial by reason of
the heavy onus resting on the Crown in the case of an appeal from an acquittal.
He was also of the opinion that the jury must have accepted the alibi evidence
introduced by the defence or had a reasonable doubt with respect to it.

 

78.                     Robins
J.A. would have directed a new trial based on the two errors. It is not clear
that he would not have done so on the basis of the error in ground one alone.
At the conclusion of his reasons relating to ground one he said (at
p. 81):

 

The correct instruction stated as it was in general
terms did not overcome the possible consequences of the incorrect instructions
aimed as they were one by one at separate parts of the Crown's case relating to
the identity of the killer of Christine Jessop. In my opinion, the
considerations which led to a new trial being directed in Bouvier apply
with equal force to this situation.

 

Brooke J.A.
attached a great deal of importance to the misdirection relating to the burden
of proof and concluded (at p. 85) that:

 

        I think the onus on the Crown is satisfied when
one examines the result of departing from the principle that proof beyond a
reasonable doubt applies when the jury considers the whole of the evidence
which it believes to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused, and not
the test which is applied to individual pieces of the evidence. As to the
individual pieces of the evidence, the fundamental issue is whether or not the
jury believes that evidence and the facts that are to be found from it.

 

79.                     The
onus resting on the Crown when it appeals an acquittal was settled in Vézeau
v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277. It is the duty of the Crown to satisfy
the court that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if the jury
had been properly instructed.

 

80.                     I
am prepared to accept that the onus is a heavy one and that the Crown must
satisfy the court with a reasonable degree of certainty. An accused who has
been acquitted once should not be sent back to be tried again unless it appears
that the error at the first trial was such that there is a reasonable degree of
certainty that the outcome may well have been affected by it. Any more
stringent test would require an appellate court to predict with certainty what
happened in the jury room. That it cannot do.

 

81.                     I
do not agree with Cory J.A. that we can say that the jury accepted or was in
doubt about the alibi evidence. As pointed out by Mr. Fairgrieve, counsel for
the respondent, the jury might not have found it necessary to deal with the
alibi because when the Crown's evidence was examined piecemeal and subjected in
isolation to the criminal standard, there was no case left against the
appellant. Or the jury may have rejected the alibi but found that what was left
of the Crown's case did not satisfy them beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

82.                     The
charge with respect to the burden of proof lays down for the jury one of the
most fundamental rules of the game. Experience and jury studies tend to confirm
the importance of these rules in relation to the outcome (see Wigmore on
Evidence, op. cit., § 2497, fn. 9). The Court of Appeal recognized this
principle in Bouvier, supra, and was affirmed by this Court. If,
as I have found, the jury accepted the instruction and examined the evidence
separately subjecting each item to the standard of proof beyond a reasonable
doubt, then the whole process of decision was distorted and there has not been
a proper trial of the appellant.

 

83.                     In
my opinion, therefore, the Crown has discharged the onus. Given the cogency of
the evidence, I have the requisite degree of certainty that the verdict would
not necessarily have been the same if the proper instruction had been given.

 

84.              Accordingly,
the appeal is dismissed.

 

        The
reasons of Lamer and Wilson JJ. were delivered by

 

 

85.                     Wilson J.‑‑I
have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleague, Justice Sopinka,
and while I agree with his disposition of the appellant's second ground of
appeal for the reasons given by him and with his disposition of the appeal as a
whole, i.e., to dismiss it, I have some reservations about his approach to the
reasonable doubt issue. I prefer therefore to write my own concurring reasons
on this aspect of the appeal.

 

86.                     All
three members of the Court of Appeal (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 50 found that the
following passages from Craig J.'s charge to the jury were erroneous:

 

 

 

(i) (in the context of credibility)

 

If you have a reasonable doubt about any of the evidence
you will give the benefit of the doubt to the accused with respect to such
evidence. Having decided what evidence you consider worthy of belief, you will
consider it as a whole, of course, in arriving at your verdict.

 

(ii) (with respect to the hair and fibre evidence)

 

It seems to me that this evidence does not go beyond
proving that Christine could have been in the Honda motor vehicle and that the
accused could have been at the scene of killing and, of course, that is not
proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

(iii) (with respect to the respondent's statements to
the undercover officer)

 

I was going to go on to say that if you find that the
evidence of the accused at trial here represents the correct interpretation of
those tapes and transcripts, or parts of the tapes and transcripts, or if you
have a reasonable doubt that that might be so, you will give him the benefit of
the doubt as to those parts of the tapes or transcripts and adopt his
interpretation.

 

(iv) (with respect to the respondent's statements
to his cellmate)

 

Now, as to the evidence in relation to that part of the
tape that I have just read, if you find the evidence of the accused at trial
represents the correct interpretation of that exchange, or if you have a
reasonable doubt that that may be so, you will give the benefit of the doubt to
the accused and adopt his interpretation.

 

Cory J.A.
concluded (for the Court) that they constituted misdirection because ""the
standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not apply to the individual
items of evidence which make up the Crown's case but rather to the total body
of evidence upon which the Crown relies to prove the guilt of the accused""
(p. 60).

 

87.                     Mr.
Ruby takes issue with this statement. He submits that the Court of Appeal
failed to recognize that the deliberations of the jury involve a two‑stage
process and that the reasonable doubt doctrine plays a role at both stages. If
the evidence does not pass the first stage, Mr. Ruby submits, it never gets
considered at the second stage. I believe that the authorities relied on by Mr.
Ruby support his submission that reasonable doubt plays two distinct roles in
the criminal trial process.

 

88.                     First,
at the primary level, the facts upon which the jury rely in order to arrive at
a determination of guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. This
does not mean, as the trial judge apparently thought, that each fact in
isolation from the rest must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, it
means that the jury must be satisfied, within the context of all the facts of
the case, that each of the facts they rely on for a finding of guilt has been
proved beyond a reasonable doubt. After looking at the context of all the
facts, if the jury still has a reasonable doubt about a particular fact, this
doubt must be resolved in favour of the accused and that piece of evidence
rejected.

 

89.                     At
the second level, reasonable doubt operates in the determination of guilt or
innocence. The jury must look at the totality of the evidence and determine
whether on the proved facts, i.e., on those facts which have survived
the scrutiny at the primary level, the accused is guilty. If there remains a
reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt, the doubt must be resolved in
favour of the accused and a verdict of not guilty entered. Neither counsel
questions this latter proposition. The Court of Appeal's statement that
""reasonable doubt does not apply to the individual items of evidence which
make up the Crown's case"" does, however, cast doubt on the role of the
doctrine at the first stage of the process. Was the Court of Appeal wrong? In
my view, both authority and logic suggest that it was.

 

90.                     In
Nadeau v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 570, Lamer J. made the following
comment at p. 573 on the issue of the standard of proof which must be met
for the facts upon which a conviction is based:

 

The jurors cannot accept his version [of the facts], or
any part of it, unless they are satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt, having
regard to all the evidence, that the events took place in this manner;
otherwise, the accused is entitled, unless a fact has been established
beyond a reasonable doubt, to the finding of fact the most favourable to
him, provided of course that it is based on evidence in the record and not mere
speculation. [Emphasis added.]

 

I believe
this statement is addressing the role of the reasonable doubt doctrine at the
primary, i.e., the fact‑finding stage. It requires a fact elicited
through the mouth of a witness to be assessed by the jury in the context of all
the evidence and to be rejected if it has not been proved beyond a reasonable
doubt.

 

91.                     In
R. v. Thatcher, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 652, Chief Justice Dickson, speaking on
this particular point for a unanimous Court, cited the foregoing passage from Nadeau
with approval and applied the reasonable doubt doctrine to the fact‑finding
process. Referring to the judge's charge in Thatcher he said at
p. 701:

 

Moreover, early on in his charge he stated:

 

It is up to you to weigh the evidence of each
witness, one against the other, and determine what you find to be true
and reject what you do not believe. [Emphasis in original.]

 

When the offending passages are read with the above and
subsequent admonitions, it is clear‑‑and, I believe, must have been
clear to the jury‑‑that the trial judge means ""accept beyond a
reasonable doubt"" when he refers to ""accepting"" Crown evidence,
and means ""accept as raising a reasonable doubt"" when he refers to
""accepting"" defence evidence. I believe there was no error made when
the charge is read as a whole.

 

92.                     The
issue was addressed in much greater depth by the High Court of Australia in Chamberlain
v. The Queen, [1984] 58 A.L.J.R. 133. Gibbs C.J. and Mason J. set out the
question as follows at p. 139:

 

        The final question of law that arises is
whether, in a case where the evidence is circumstantial, each fact on which an
inference is sought to be based must itself be proved beyond a reasonable
doubt. In considering this matter it is necessary to keep distinct a number of
questions which tend to be confused. In the first place, the question arises
whether the proper method of approach to the facts is for the jury to consider
each item of evidence separately, and to eliminate it from consideration unless
satisfied about it beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

The Justices
repudiated that approach. They stated at p. 139:

 

        We have no doubt that the position is correctly
stated in the following passage in R. v. Beble, [1979] Qd. R. 278 at
289, that ""It is not the law that a jury should examine separately each
item of evidence adduced by the prosecution, apply the onus of proof beyond
reasonable doubt as to that evidence and reject it if they are not so
satisfied"". At the end of the trial the jury must consider all the evidence,
and in doing so they may find that one piece of evidence resolves their doubts
as to another. For example, the jury, considering the evidence of one witness
by itself, may doubt whether it is truthful, but other evidence may provide
corroboration, and when the jury considers the evidence as a whole they may
decide that the witness should be believed. Again, the quality of evidence of
identification may be poor, but other evidence may support its correctness; in
such a case the jury should not be told to look at the evidence of each witness
""separately in, so to speak, a hermetically sealed compartment""; they
should consider the accumulation of the evidence . . . .

 

93.                     At
page 140 the Justices expressed their agreement with the observation in R.
v. Van Beelen (1973), 4 S.A.S.R. 353 (S.C. in banco), at
p. 379, that it is ""an obvious proposition in logic, that you cannot
be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of an inference drawn from
facts about the existence of which you are in doubt"".

 

94.                     The
Justices then tried to resolve a confusion (p. 140) that had arisen from
another passage in Van Beelen which had been taken by some to suggest
that the jury was literally required to split up their deliberations
into two separate stages:

 

The court [in Van Beelen] said, at p. 374:

 

""But the requirement of proof beyond reasonable
doubt relates to the final stage in the process; the jury is not, in our view,
required to split up the various stages in the process of reasoning leading to
the conclusion of guilt beyond reasonable doubt and to apply some particular
standard of proof to each of those steps...and to instruct them to do so would,
in our view, be confusing and possibly misleading and would tend to the
imposition of an artificial and scholastic straight‑jacket on their
deliberations.

 

        That, of course, does not mean that they ought
to be encouraged or permitted to draw inferences of guilt from doubtful facts.
As a matter of common sense it is impossible to infer guilt beyond reasonable
doubt from facts which are in doubt. There is a clear distinction between
drawing an inference of guilt from a combination of several proved facts, none
of which by itself would support the inference, and drawing an inference of
guilt from several facts whose existence is in doubt. In the first place the
combination does what each fact taken in isolation could not do; in the second
case the combination counts for nothing.""

 

        It is clear that the first part of this
statement was not intended to contradict the second. It refers only to the
manner in which the jury should be directed. It is quite correct to say that
the jury are not required to split up the various stages in the process of
their reasoning: they are not required to make findings on questions of primary
fact, and jurors who agree in reaching the same ultimate conclusion may
nevertheless disagree as to what evidence is to be accepted, or as to what
inferences are to be drawn from evidence which they do accept. However, that
does not mean that the jury may draw an inference of guilt from a fact which is
not proved beyond reasonable doubt. [Emphasis added.]

 

The Justices
then (p. 140) adopted the following passage from Van Beelen as to
what instruction should be given to the jury:

 

We think, as we shall develop later, that the jury
should be told that they can draw inferences only from facts which are clearly
proved, but further than that it is neither necessary nor desirable to go.

 

and rejected
a criticism which had been made of it:

 

        Sir Richard Eggleston in Evidence, Proof and
Probability (2nd ed., 1983), p. 122, expresses the view that this
statement is erroneous. With all respect we do not agree with the criticism of
the learned author, but it must be understood that the court was intending to
say that inferences cannot be drawn from facts that remain doubtful at the
end of the jury's consideration, and did not mean that facts which, viewed in
isolation, seem doubtful must be disregarded. However, in our opinion, it must
follow from the reasoning in R. v. Van Beelen that the jury can draw
inferences only from facts which are proved beyond reasonable doubt.
[Emphasis added.]

 

The Justices
referred at p. 141 to the conflict of authority on the subject in the
United States:

 

In the United States there is a conflict of authority on
the question, and we do not share Wigmore's apparent preference for the view
that it is only the whole issue (or the elements of the offence) that must be
proved beyond a reasonable doubt: Wigmore on Evidence (3rd. ed., 1940),
vol. IX, p. 324.

 

Murphy J.
concurred with Gibbs C.J. and Mason J. at p. 155:

 

        I agree that requirement of proof beyond
reasonable doubt means that any fact should not be accepted for the purpose of
inferring guilt unless, in the light of all the evidence, existence of that
fact is established beyond reasonable doubt. Every crucial element must be
proved beyond reasonable doubt.

 

Brennan J.
added his concurrence at p. 168:

 

        The prosecution case rested on circumstantial
evidence. Circumstantial evidence can, and often does, clearly prove the
commission of a criminal offence, but two conditions must be met. First, the
primary facts from which the inference of guilt is to be drawn must be proved
beyond reasonable doubt. No greater cogency can be attributed to an inference
based upon particular facts than the cogency that can be attributed to each of
those facts. Secondly, the inference of guilt must be the only inference which is
reasonably open on all the primary facts which the jury finds. The drawing of
the inference is not a matter of evidence: it is solely a function of the
jury's critical judgment of men and affairs, their experience and their reason.
An inference of guilt can safely be drawn if it is based upon primary facts
which are found beyond reasonable doubt and if it is the only inference which
is reasonably open upon the whole body of primary facts.

 

Only Deane
J. disagreed on this issue (p. 181).

 

95.                     I
find the position taken by the majority in Chamberlain compelling and
consistent with this Court's approach in Nadeau and Thatcher.
Moreover, as a matter of strict logic the approach has a lot to commend it. How
could one come to a conclusion with any degree of certainty if one has
reasonable doubts about the facts upon which the conclusion is based?

 

96.                     Was
the trial judge in error then in the passages from the charge cited above? In
my view, he was. While the trial judge was correct to direct the jury not to
use facts that were not proved beyond a reasonable doubt in order to found a
conviction, he erred in suggesting (or seeming to suggest) that each fact
should be assessed in isolation from the others. What he should have told the
jury, in my opinion, is that in their ultimate determination of guilt they
could rely only on facts which, when assessed in the context of all the facts,
they found to have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt; that they must not
make a finding of guilt on doubtful facts; but that facts which might seem
doubtful when viewed in isolation might become completely credible against the
backdrop of all the other facts.

 

97.                     It
would be my respectful view that if the trial judge was in error on this point,
and I think he was, the Court of Appeal was also in error. The Court of Appeal
indicated that the only thing that must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt was
the guilt of the accused. The fairly clear implication of the Court of Appeal's
judgment is that the facts underlying this conclusion do not themselves require
to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In my view, this is wrong. It gives the
jury no guidance as to what standard of proof it must apply to the fact‑finding
exercise. In the absence of direction they might apply a balance of
probabilities or even less stringent test. I agree with the Justices of the
High Court of Australia that the jury must be instructed at some point in the
charge that in making a determination as to the guilt of the accused they must
have resort only to facts which, when assessed in the context of all the facts,
have been proved to their satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt. I believe
that a jury would have no difficulty in comprehending such a direction since it
accords with logic and common sense as well as with the law.

 

98.                     In
my view then the trial judge's charge to the jury was in error although not for
the reasons given by the Court of Appeal. I do, however, agree with my
colleague that the trial judge's misdirection mandates the new trial ordered by
the Court of Appeal.

after person charged but prior to conviction‑‑Whether or not right
to liberty infringed‑‑Whether or not principles of fundamental
justice infringed‑‑If section 7 infringed, whether or not
infringement justified under s. 1 .

 

        Respondents Beare and Higgins
were charged with separate criminal offences and were served respectively with
an appearance notice and a summons requiring attendance at R.C.M.P. offices to
be fingerprinted under the Identification of Criminals Act . Section 2 of
that Act provided for the fingerprinting of a person in lawful custody and ss.
453.3(3)  and 455.5(5)  of the Criminal Code  required an appearance and
deemed a person so appearing to be in lawful custody charged with an indictable
offence. Neither respondent attended at the R.C.M.P. offices as required. The
requirement that appearances be made for fingerprinting following charge but
before conviction was unsuccessfully challenged on separate motions but the
appeals, which were heard together, were allowed. The constitutional questions
before this Court queried whether or not s. 2  of the Identification of
Criminals Act  and ss. 453.3(3)  or s. 455.5(5)  of the Criminal Code ,
to the extent that they provided for the fingerprinting of a person charged
with but not convicted of an indictable offence, infringed s. 7  of the Charter ,
and if so, whether or not such infringement was justified by s. 1 . Sections 8 ,
9 , 10  and 11 (c) and (d) of the Charter  were also relied
on.

 

        Held: The appeal should be allowed. The
first constitutional question should be answered in the negative in respect of
each case; it was not necessary to consider the second.

 

        Fingerprinting, while an
invaluable tool of criminal investigation, serves a wide variety of purposes
not all confined to the criminal justice system and the judicial process.
Sections 453.3(3)  and 455.5(5)  are not simple expansions of the authority to
take fingerprints and photographs but rather integral parts of a larger scheme
aimed at reducing the number of persons who are arrested and taken into
custody.

 

        The impugned provisions
infringe the rights guaranteed by s. 7  because they require a person to appear
at a specific time and place and oblige that person to go through an
identification process on pain of imprisonment for failure to comply. The
infringement of these rights, however, does not violate the principles of
fundamental justice for the process does not unduly invade the rights of the
accused. A sense of proportion is necessary in considering the matter.

 

        Subjecting a person charged to
fingerprinting procedures does not violate the principles of fundamental
justice, there being reasonable and probable grounds to believe a person has
committed an offence. Any indignity attached to having one's fingerprints taken
is much less than the stigma attached to many ordinary aspects of law enforcement
in relation to persons in custody charged with an offence. The common law
experience and legislative practice both indicate that custodial fingerprinting
has not been considered fundamentally unfair. Here, the respondents, while not
in custody, should be treated as being in the same position with respect to
fingerprinting as a person in custody. Prior to the Bail Reform Act,
they could have been arrested on reasonable and probable grounds that they had
committed the offences charged.

 

        The impugned provisions did
not violate the principles of fundamental justice through arbitrariness or any
violation of respondents' privacy. The legislation was not arbitrary in its
scope and did not create an arbitrary or irrational statutory scheme.
Discretion, including the police discretion to fingerprint or not, is an
essential, judicially recognized feature of the criminal justice system. The
requirements necessary to issue and confirm an appearance notice offer a
sufficient safeguard to meet the requirements of fundamental justice. A person
who is charged on reasonable and probable grounds with having committed a
serious crime must expect a significant loss of personal privacy incidental to
his being taken into custody.

 

        The issue of the retention of
the fingerprints of an accused who was not convicted did not arise here because
respondents' fingerprints were never taken.

 

        Sections 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 (c)
and (d) of the Charter  were not violated. Section 8  guarantees
the right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure and s. 9  gives
the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned. Neither section was
breached for the reasons like those given with respect to s. 7 . Section 10  (the
right to counsel) and s. 11 (c) (the guarantee against accused persons
being witnesses against themselves) were not applicable here. Section 11 (d)
(the guarantee to a fair trial) could not be breached if the fingerprints used
as evidence were taken in a manner consistent with fundamental justice.

 

        It was not necessary to
consider s. 1  of the Charter .

r. v. beare La Forest J.       

 

r. c. beare Le juge La Forest  

 

1.         La
Forest J.‑‑The issue in this appeal is whether s. 2 of the Identification
of Criminals Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I‑1, and ss. 453.3(3) and 455.5(5)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, as amended by R.S.C.
1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 2, violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ,
in so far as they authorize the fingerprinting of a person who has been
arrested but not yet convicted. The issue arises in two contexts: (a) in
respect of a person to whom an appearance notice has been issued pursuant to s.
451 of the Code; and (b) in respect of a person who has been required by
summons to appear for fingerprinting pursuant to s. 455.5 . In this Court, the
principal question addressed was whether those provisions contravene s. 7  of
the Charter ; ss. 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 (c) and (d) of the Charter 
were also relied on, but no argument regarding these provisions was advanced.
Section 7  reads:

 

        7. Everyone has the right to life,
liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof
except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

 

Facts

 

2.         In February 1983, the respondent, Beare,
was charged with breaking, entering and theft, contrary to s. 306(1) (b)
of the Criminal Code . He was served with an appearance notice requiring
him to attend in court and to appear at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
(R.C.M.P.) offices ""for the purposes of the Identification of Criminals
Act "". The latter Act, by s. 2 , provides that a person in lawful
custody may be subjected to certain processes of identification, the best known
today, of course, being fingerprinting, which has been sanctioned by the
Governor in Council pursuant to this provision; see SOR/48‑412. Section 2 
reads as follows:

 

        2. (1) Any person in lawful
custody, charged with, or under conviction of an indictable offence, or who has
been apprehended under the Extradition Act  or the Fugitive Offenders
Act, may be subjected, by or under the direction of those in whose custody
he is, to the measurements, processes and operations practised under the system
for the identification of criminals commonly known as the Bertillon Signaletic
System, or to any measurements, processes or operations sanctioned by the
Governor in Council having the like object in view.

 

        (2) Such
force may be used as is necessary to the effectual carrying out and application
of such measurements, processes and operations.

 

        (3) The
signaletic cards and other results thereof may be published for the purpose of
affording information to officers and others engaged in the execution or
administration of the law.

 

A person to whom an appearance notice
is given is, by s. 453.3(3)  of the Criminal Code  deemed to be a person
in lawful custody for the purposes of the Identification of Criminals Act .
Section 453.3(3)  at the relevant time read as follows:

 

        453.3 ...

 

        (3) An
appearance notice or promise to appear or a recognizance entered into before an
officer in charge may, where the accused is alleged to have committed an
indictable offence, require the accused to appear at a time and place stated
therein for the purposes of the Identification of Criminals Act , and a
person so appearing is deemed, for the purposes only of that Act, to be in
lawful custody charged with an indictable offence.

 

This provision was subsequently
amended (S.C. 1985, c. 19, s. 77), but in a manner that does not affect the
disposition of this appeal.

 

3.         If a person fails to appear as required
by such notice, a warrant may be issued for his arrest (s. 453.4). He is also
guilty of an offence under s. 133(5) of the Code.

 

4.         In December, 1982, the respondent,
Higgins, was charged with defrauding Soo Security Motorways of more than $200
contrary to s. 338(1)  of the Criminal Code . He was served with a summons
requiring him to attend in court and to appear at R.C.M.P. offices ""for
the purposes of the Identification of Criminals Act "". By section
455.5(5) of the Code, a person so summoned is also deemed to be a person
in lawful custody for the purposes of the Identification of Criminals Act .
Section 455.5(5)  reads:

 

        455.5 ...

 

        (5) A
summons may, where the accused is alleged to have committed an indictable
offence, require the accused to appear at a time and place stated therein for
the purposes of the Identification of Criminals Act , and a person so
appearing is deemed, for the purposes only of that Act, to be in lawful custody
charged with an indictable offence.

 

A person who fails to comply with such
a summons is also subject to arrest by warrant (s. 455.6) and is guilty of an
offence (s. 133(4)).

 

5.         Neither Beare nor Higgins attended at
the R.C.M.P. offices as required. Both challenged the requirement that they
appear for fingerprinting as being a violation of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms . On March 14, 1983, Rutherford J. of the Court of
Queen's Bench of Saskatchewan dismissed Beare's application without recorded
reasons. On April 4, 1983, Higgins' application was also dismissed by Maurice
J. who gave reasons.

 

6.         Higgins' application was for relief
pursuant to the Charter , particularly ss. 8 , 11 (d), 24(1)  and
pursuant to s. 52(1)  of the Constitution Act, 1982 . Though Maurice J.
thought the application contained procedural defects, he nonetheless proceeded
to examine the merits of the case and concluded that the Identification of
Criminals Act  did not contravene ss. 8  and 11 (d) and even if it did,
the Act would be saved by s. 1  of the Charter .

 

7.         Both respondents appealed to the
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. The appeals were heard together. Both argued that
a requirement subjecting an accused to fingerprinting under the Identification
of Criminals Act  before conviction for an indictable offence infringed upon
his rights as guaranteed by the Charter . Though reliance was placed on
ss. 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 (c) and (d) of the Charter , the court
restricted its considerations to s. 7 .

 

8.         By judgment dated April 14, 1987, the
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal allowed the appeals (1987), 56 Sask. R. 173,
[1987] 4 W.W.R. 309, 57 C.R. (3d) 193 (hereinafter cited from (1987), 56 Sask.
R. 173), and ruled that to the extent that they provide for the fingerprinting
of a person charged with but not convicted of an indictable offence, s. 2  of
the Identification of Criminals Act  and ss. 453.3(3)  and 455.5(5)  of the
Criminal Code  violate s. 7  of the Charter  and are of no force and
effect. The violation did not constitute a reasonable limit within the meaning
of s. 1  of the Charter . Separate judgments were given by Bayda C.J.S.
(Brownridge J.A. concurring) and Cameron J.A.

 

9.         In Bayda C.J.S.'s view, the concept
""life, liberty and security of the person"" refers not only to
physical but to mental integrity. The latter, he observed, could be subsumed in
the phrase ""the dignity and worth of the person."" As he saw it, subjecting
a person to fingerprinting prior to conviction violates the elements of dignity
and self‑respect inherent in s. 7  of the Charter . He states at
p. 182:

 

It
is common knowledge that fingerprinting is not carried out universally but only
in respect of those thought to have engaged in criminal activity ... that in
the minds of the public fingerprinting is associated with criminals and
criminal activity: to be fingerprinted is to be treated like a criminal. It is
one thing, however, to have been found by a court to be a criminal and then to
be treated like one. It is quite another not to have been so found
(particularly when the person has an honest belief in his innocence) and to be
treated like one. The humiliation is exacerbated when the person realizes that
the fingerprints remain as a permanent record, a permanent stigma,
notwithstanding the withdrawal or the dismissal of the charge. That such a
person's reputation, self‑respect or dignity may suffer in the process is
patent.

 

10.        Bayda C.J.S. was of the opinion that this
violation was not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice,
given the absence of safeguards in s. 2 of the Act to prevent injury to those
whom there is no need to identify or those who fall subject to the Act but are
not criminals. He noted that the person in authority who has the power to
require the fingerprinting need not have reasonable and probable grounds to
believe the accused had committed the offence. That person could be arbitrary
and capricious. In Bayda C.J.S.'s view the belief of the person who laid the
charge is irrelevant. The final indignity, he noted, is the lack of any
requirement to destroy the fingerprints if the accused is discharged. He
referred to the British statute, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
(U.K.), 1984, c. 60, that incorporates such safeguards.

 

11.        Bayda C.J.S. then went on to consider
whether the legislation might be saved under s. 1  of the Charter  and
concluded that it could not.

 

12.        Cameron J.A. arrived at the same
conclusion by a somewhat different route. After disposing of a number of
procedural and jurisdictional issues not raised in this Court, and referring to
the decisions of this Court in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2
S.C.R. 486, and Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, as
establishing the applicable principles, he went on to discuss the Identification
of Criminals Act  in terms of these principles.

 

13.        To the extent that the Act applies to a
person in custody, accused but not convicted of the commission of a serious
crime, he stated, its purposes are to enable the identity of that person to be
established for three reasons: (1) to assist in determining whether the accused
committed the crime in those cases where the identity of the person who
committed the crime is in issue; (2) to assist in determining if the accused
has been convicted or stands charged of other crimes in order to establish
whether and on what terms the accused might be released pending trial, whether
the complaint ought to be presented by way of summary conviction or indictment,
whether to proceed by way of second conviction, and so on; and (3) to
facilitate the apprehension of the accused should he fail to appear in court.
He, too, noted that there are no provisions governing the ultimate disposition
of the fingerprints in the event of a withdrawal of the charge, a stay or an
acquittal.

 

14.        Cameron J.A. considered that the impugned
provisions of the Act and of the Criminal Code  deprive the person
affected thereby of liberty and security of the person. The person is required
by law to surrender himself into the custody of the authorities, or face arrest
and prosecution, and must submit to the bodily intrusions sanctioned by s. 2 of
the Act. Such bodily force as is necessary to that end may lawfully be used.

 

15.        He went on to say that this violation was
not made in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. Section 2 of
the Act and ss. 453.3(3)  and 455.5(5)  of the Criminal Code  provide no
criteria as to how the discretion allowed by those provisions should be
exercised. The Act does not require fingerprinting; it permits
it. But section 2 is utterly barren of any guidelines by which the authorities
acting under the section are to decide whether, and to what extent, an accused
will be subjected to fingerprinting. Sections 453.3  and 455.5  are equally open
to random and arbitrary action. Anyone charged with an indictable offence may
be required to appear whether or not one or more of the purposes of the Act
will be served thereby. Even if one were to construe ss. 453.3(3)  and 455.5(5) 
as empowering a justice to compel the appearance of an accused for
identification purposes only where it is made to appear that one or more of the
purposes of the Act would be served by that appearance, there would remain
grave flaws, because the sections in issue contain no framework for the exercise
of that power. They do not require, for example, that the justice act only on
credibly based probabilities.

 

16.        Cameron J.A. indicated that the failure
of the law to restrict the exercise of the powers it confers to situations in
which one or more of the legitimate purposes of the Act would be served,
coupled with its failure to provide a principled framework governing the
exercise of that power, result in its undoing. He reviewed the report issued by
the English Royal Commission and the Law Reform Commission of Canada Working
Paper dealing with these matters and concluded that the provisions in issue did
not meet the test of s. 1  of the Charter .

 

17.        The Crown then sought and obtained leave
to appeal to this Court. The following constitutional grounds were stated by
the Chief Justice in respect of the Beare appeal:

 

1. Do
section 2 of the Identification of Criminals Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I‑1,
and s. 453.3(3) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, to the
extent that they provide for the fingerprinting of a person (who is not a young
person as defined by the Young Offenders Act, S.C. 1980‑81‑82‑83,
c. 110, and) who has been charged with but not convicted of an indictable
offence, infringe rights guaranteed by s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2. If
section 2 of the Identification of Criminals Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I‑1,
and s. 453.3(3) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, do
infringe rights guaranteed in s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms , are they justified by s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms  and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act,
1982 ?

 

18.        The Chief Justice stated identical
questions in respect of the Higgins appeal except that s. 455.5(5)  of the Criminal
Code  was substituted for s. 453.3(3) .

 

19.        Following the hearing of the appeals on
December 17, 1987, the Court immediately allowed the appeal and held that the
impugned provisions did not contravene the Charter . Since the accused
had refused and, therefore, not been subjected to fingerprinting, the issue of
their retention did not arise and the Court did not pronounce on this question.
The Court announced it would give reasons later when it would also dispose of
the matter of costs, which counsel for the respondent Beare sought in any
event. That judgment reads as follows:

 

        Since
a decision as to the constitutional validity of the impugned provisions of the Identification
of Criminals Act  and the Criminal Code  is a matter of urgency in the
administration of justice, the Court disposes of these appeals forthwith, its
reasons to follow at a later date.

 

        The
Court finds the provisions constitutional and allows the appeals. The issue of
retention of fingerprints after acquittal does not arise on the facts of these
appeals. The question of costs is reserved.

 

The Nature of the Legislation

 

20.        The process of fingerprinting was
developed in the late nineteenth century and became the primary method of
identification for law enforcement purposes in Canada in 1908; see P.C. 1614,
July 21, 1908, Canada Gazette, April 7, 1917, at p. 3484. By 1948, it
had completely replaced the Bertillon system of identification which relied on
the recording of a series of precise body measurements; see SOR/48‑412.

 

21.        Fingerprinting is an invaluable tool of
criminal investigation because of the ease and rapidity of the process and
because it is virtually infallible, no two persons' fingerprints being alike.
The quick acceptance of fingerprints by courts in the United States and Great
Britain as a convenient and reliable means of identification was later followed
in Canada; see R. v. Bacon (1915), 11 Cr. App. R. 90; People v.
Sallow, 165 N.Y.S. 915 (Gen. Sess. 1917); Pelletier v. Le Roi,
[1952] B.R. 633, at p. 635. Today their scientific reliability and usefulness
to the criminal justice system is fully accepted; see Donald Campbell,
""Fingerprints: A Review,"" [1985] Crim. L. Rev. 195, at
p. 196.

 

22.        Fingerprints serve a wide variety of
purposes in the criminal justice system. These include linking the accused to
the crime where latent prints are found at the scene or on physical evidence;
determining if the accused has been charged with, or convicted of other crimes
in order to decide whether, for example, he should be released pending trial or
whether he should be proceeded against by way of summary conviction or
indictment; ascertaining whether the accused is unlawfully at large or has
other charges outstanding; and assisting in the apprehension of an accused
should he fail to appear. As well, fingerprints taken on arrest are used to
identify prisoners with suicidal tendencies, sex offenders, career criminals
and persons with a history of escape attempts so that they can be segregated or
monitored as may appear appropriate.

 

23.        Fingerprints are also of great assistance
in the judicial process. Thus in addition to their utility in positively
identifying an accused, they may also assist the Crown in determining the
punishment it should seek by revealing, for example, whether the accused is a
first offender or otherwise. This, of course, will be of assistance to the
court in imposing an appropriate sentence.

 

24.        These are only some of the more important
uses to which fingerprints are put. In brief, they have become an integral part
of the criminal justice system at every stage. I should add that they provide
advantages to an innocent accused. They may establish that another has
committed the crime and they may also ensure that the innocent will not be
wrongly identified with someone else's criminal history.

 

25.        Finally, I should, in light of the view
taken by the Court of Appeal, add that use of fingerprints is not confined to
criminal matters, but serves a number of functions outside the criminal
process. These include their use in relation to security clearances, provincial
and municipal licensing of taxi drivers, security guards and others, positions
involving contact with vulnerable members of society, applications for Canadian
citizenship and visas to some foreign countries. The Attorney General for
Alberta points out that it is even used by some parents to ensure the
identification of their children if they become injured or missing.

 

26.        I turn now to the specific purpose of ss.
453.3(3)  and 455.5(5)  of the Criminal Code . These were enacted in 1971
as part of the Bail Reform Act, R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 2, s. 5.
Before that time persons who were to be charged with an indictable offence
would either be arrested or served with a summons. Appearance notices were not
used and summonses were used in only a minority of cases; see Criminal Code ,
Part XIV, ss. 448‑459; Debates of the Senate, March 29, 1971, at
pp. 786‑792. It was to reduce the number of persons being arrested and
held in custody that the Bail Reform Act was enacted; see Debates of
the Senate, ibid. The Act largely reflected the recommendations of the
Report of the Canadian Committee on Corrections, Toward Unity: Criminal
Justice and Corrections, 1969 (The Ouimet Report), which recognized the
need to make new arrangements for fingerprinting and photographing if the
number of people arrested was to be substantially reduced. The Report, at
p. 98, states:

 

As
the Committee envisages that there will be fewer persons in custody if its
recommendations are implemented, it will be necessary to extend the provisions
of the Identification of Criminals Act  to require a person, who has been
summoned to appear to answer a charge of having committed an indictable
offence, to present himself and submit to fingerprinting as directed in the
summons. Failure to do so without lawful excuse should result in arrest.

 

27.        As can be seen then, ss. 453.3(3)  and
455.5(5)  are integral parts of a larger scheme aimed at reducing the number of
persons who are arrested and taken into custody. They are not simple expansions
of the authority to take fingerprints and photographs.

 

Section 7  of the Charter 

 

28.        The analysis of s. 7  of the Charter 
involves two steps. To trigger its operation there must first be a finding that
there has been a deprivation of the right to ""life, liberty and security
of the person"" and, secondly, that that deprivation is contrary to the
principles of fundamental justice. Like other provisions of the Charter ,
s. 7  must be construed in light of the interests it was meant to protect. It
should be given a generous interpretation, but it is important not to overshoot
the actual purpose of the right in question; see R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.,
[1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 344.

 

29.        The Court of Appeal, we saw, found that
the impugned provisions constituted an infringement of the right guaranteed by
the opening words of s. 7 , the majority because fingerprinting offends the
""dignity and self‑respect"" of at least those persons who because
of their self‑perception or the perception of the community would feel
demeaned by being thus treated. In short, the majority thought that being
subjected to fingerprinting was to be treated like a criminal. This approach
appears to be broad and indefinite and to introduce an undesirable notion of
differentiation among those subjected to the procedure. For my part, I prefer
the more specific finding of Cameron J.A. that the impugned provisions infringe
the rights guaranteed by s. 7  because they require a person to appear at a
specific time and place and oblige that person to go through an identification
process on pain of imprisonment for failure to comply. The appellant concedes
this position, as does the Attorney General for Manitoba. Contention thus essentially
revolved around the issue whether the alleged infringement of s. 7  rights
violated the principles of fundamental justice. Because I have come to the
conclusion that these principles have not been violated in these cases, I shall
confine my remarks to that issue.

 

30.        In Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra,
at p. 512, this Court stated that the principles of fundamental justice are to
be found in the basic tenets and principles not only of our judicial system but
also of the other components of our legal system. Consistent with this
approach, the Court in R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 327, held
that to determine whether a legislative scheme for the indeterminate detention
of dangerous offenders violated the principles of fundamental justice, it was
necessary to examine that scheme in light of the basic principles of penal
policy that had animated legislative and judicial practice in Canada and other
common law jurisdictions. Here we are engaged in assessing law enforcement
measures, specifically in the context of a person charged with an offence, and
it is relevant then to consider them against the applicable principles and
policies that have animated legislative and judicial practice in the field.

 

31.        The majority in the Court of Appeal
stressed that for many people it is demeaning to be subjected to the process of
fingerprinting, and it cannot be denied that for many the process is
distasteful. But it must be remembered that the interest of the public in law
enforcement necessitates the subjection of the individual to other distasteful
procedures. It is distasteful, and extremely so for some crimes, merely to be
charged with an offence, to say nothing of the stigma attached to being arrested,
detained and required to answer the charge in a public trial. As Chief Justice
Dickson has stated in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at pp. 119‑20:

 

An
individual charged with a criminal offence faces grave social and personal
consequences, including potential loss of physical liberty, subjection to
social stigma and ostracism from the community, as well as other social,
psychological and economic harms.

 

32.        The stigma attached to such ordinary
aspects of law enforcement and the criminal justice system, I would have
thought, far outweighs any feeling of indignity attached to having one's
fingerprints taken. Yet I do not think that where there is reasonable and
probable cause to believe a person has committed an offence, it can be
seriously argued that subjecting a person to these procedures violates the
principles of fundamental justice.

 

33.        The application of s. 2  of the Identification
of Criminals Act  is confined to persons in or deemed to be in lawful
custody, who are charged with or have been convicted of an indictable offence.
It should be observed that the common law permitted a number of other, in my
view more serious, intrusions on the dignity of an individual or persons in
custody in the interest of law enforcement. As an incident to a lawful arrest,
a peace officer has a right to search the person arrested and to take any
property the officer reasonably believes is connected with the offence charged,
or any weapon found upon such person; see R. v. Morrison (1987), 20
O.A.C. 230. This authority is based on the need to disarm an accused and to
discover evidence. In the course of custodial arrest an accused may be
stripped. Of particular relevance, height, weight and natural or artificial
marks on the body, such as birth marks or tattoo marks, may be used for
purposes of identification; see Adair v. M`Garry, [1933] S.L.T. 482 (J.)

 

34.        These procedures have been permitted because
of the felt need in the community to arm the police with adequate and
reasonable powers for the investigation of crime. Should fingerprinting be
assimilated to these procedures? Many considerations, we saw, argue for that
position. Promptitude and facility in the identification and the discovery of
indicia of guilt or innocence are of great importance in criminal
investigations. This, along with its certitude, which is critical to the
criminal justice system, has resulted in the general use of fingerprinting by
police forces throughout the world. What really requires determination is
whether in the circumstances the process unduly invades the rights of the
accused.

 

35.        In examining this question one must have
a sense of proportion. Is the taking of fingerprints any more serious an
invasion of the right of a person in custody than examining the person's body
for birthmarks and the like? I do not think so and, as I noted, being arrested
and charged for an offence seems to me to be more serious. As Augustus Hand J.
stated in United States v. Kelly, 55 F.2d 67 (2nd Cir. 1932), at
p. 70:

 

It
is no more humiliating than other means of identification that have been
universally held to infringe neither constitutional nor common‑law
rights. Finger printing is used in numerous branches of business and of civil
service, and is not in itself a badge of crime. As a physical invasion it
amounts to almost nothing, and as a humiliation it can never amount to as much
as that caused by the publicity attending a sensational indictment to which
innocent men may have to submit.

 

36.        The view expressed in United States v.
Kelly, supra, was soon afterwards mirrored by the Scottish case of Adair
v. M`Garry, supra, in 1933, which made clear that the Court there
regarded the practice of custodial fingerprinting as comparatively innocuous,
one that if denied would hamper the police in the investigation and detection
of crime. Canadian courts have tended to follow that case and the great weight
of authority in this country is that custodial fingerprinting is justifiable at
common law; see R. v. Buckingham and Vickers (1943), 86 C.C.C. 76
(B.C.S.C.); R. v. Hayward (1957), 118 C.C.C. 365, at p. 372 (N.B.C.A.); R.
v. Nowakowski (1977), 40 C.R.N.S. 144 (B.C.S.C.); R. v. McLarty (No. 2)
(1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 72 (Ont. Ct. S.P.); R. v. Jacobson, Ont. Dist.
Ct., January 31, 1978, unreported; see also R. v. Nielsen and Stolar
(1984), 16 C.C.C. (3d) 39 (Man. C.A.), leave to appeal refused [1985] 1 S.C.R.
xi. In R. v. A.N. (1978), 2 C.R. (3d) 55 (B.C.C.A.), aff'g R. v.
Nowakowski, supra, it is true, Branca J.A. expressed a contrary
view, but the other members of the court expressed no opinion on the matter and
that court later indicated in Brown v. Baugh and Williams (1982), 70
C.C.C. (2d) 71 (B.C.C.A.), that it might be inclined to the view that the
common law would permit the police to fingerprint a suspect in the proper
circumstances and using reasonable force (aff'd [1984] 1 S.C.R. 192, without
reference to this point).

 

37.        In England the issue is not fully
settled, but the courts seem to be leaning in the same direction. It is true
that Scott, L.J. in Dumbell v. Roberts, [1944] 1 All E.R. 326 (C.A.),
expressed the view that the taking of fingerprints of a person charged but not
convicted was inconsistent with the presumption of innocence. However, in Callis
v. Gunn, [1963] 3 All E.R. 677 (Q.B.D.), at p. 681, Lord Parker C.J., after
noting that the other members of the court did not address the issue, referred
favourably to Adair v. M`Garry, supra. However that may be, in
the United States, the Kelly decision, supra, has been followed
and quoted approvingly by most courts, and as has been said, ""As a general
rule, in the absence of statute, peace officers will be permitted to record the
fingerprints of persons lawfully arrested on a felony charge""; see Andre
A. Moenssens, Fingerprints and the Law (1969), c. 4, at p. 43 (the
author reviews the cases at pp. 40‑43). In fact, there is persuasive
authority that their power extends to misdemeanours and can, in certain
circumstances, be used as an investigatory tool in the absence of arrest; see Hayes
v. Florida, 470 U.S. 811 (1985), at p. 816.

 

38.        I find it unnecessary to consider the
latter point or, indeed, to decide definitively whether in the absence of
statute, a peace officer would, at common law, have authority to require an
accused person in custody on a charge for an indictable offence to be
fingerprinted. That is provided for by the impugned measures. But it seems to
me the common law experience strongly supports the view that subjecting a
person to being fingerprinted in those circumstances does not violate
fundamental justice.

 

39.        While the common law is, of course, not
determinative in assessing whether a particular practice violates a principle
of fundamental justice, it is certainly one of the major repositories of the
basic tenets of our legal system referred to in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act,
supra. The common law experience reveals that the vast majority of judges
who have had to consider the matter have not found custodial fingerprinting
fundamentally unfair. Indeed they were prepared to accept the procedure as
permissible at common law and as being similar in principle to the authority to
physically restrain a person in custody, and to physically search that person;
see Adair v. M`Garry, supra.

 

40.        Legislative practice has been similar.
This country is by no means alone in authorizing the police to fingerprint
persons in custody for indictable offences. There is legislation of this kind
in the United Kingdom (see Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (U.K.),
1984, c. 60) and in a large number of the states of the United States; see
Moenssens, supra, at pp. 43‑60. While not conclusive, this too
suggests that compulsory custodial fingerprinting does not offend against the
principles of fundamental justice.

 

41.        Nor, despite the differences in the two
constitutions, is it without relevance that attempts to have custodial
fingerprinting declared unconstitutional under the comparable provision under
the United States Constitution, and for that matter other provisions of that
Constitution, have been almost uniformly rejected; see Moenssens, supra,
at pp. 62‑72. The experience regarding other provisions of the Charter ,
which I shall examine later, is also indicative of the view that should be
taken on this issue. Leaving aside questions respecting procedure that should
be followed before fingerprints are taken, the foregoing material all point to
the conclusion that custodial fingerprinting does not violate the principles of
fundamental justice.

 

42.        The respondents in these cases were not
in custody, but were nonetheless required to subject themselves to
fingerprinting. Their position, however, should not for this purpose differ
from that of a person who has been arrested. Before the Bail Reform Act,
they could have been arrested on the basis that there were reasonable and
probable grounds that they had committed the offences charged. I cannot see how
they can complain about a procedure, like that in the Bail Reform Act,
that permits a lesser intrusion than arrest but requires them to conform to a
procedure to which they could be subjected if arrested.

 

Arbitrariness

 

43.        The judges in the Court of Appeal were of
the view that the impugned provisions violated the principles of fundamental
justice because they operated in an arbitrary manner. Before entering into a
discussion of the specific shortcomings they attributed to these provisions, it
is useful to look at the legislation generally from the standpoint of arbitrariness.

 

44.        I begin by referring to what has already
been said regarding the purposes of the legislation and the many uses to which
fingerprinting has been put in effecting those purposes. In brief, the main
purposes of the Identification of Criminals Act  and the allied
provisions of the Code, as they apply to a person charged with but not
convicted of an offence, are to establish the identity and criminal record of
the accused, to discover whether there are warrants outstanding for his arrest
or if he has escaped from lawful custody, and, in some cases, to gather
evidence which may be relevant to the question of whether or not he committed
the crime with which he has been charged.

 

45.        As already noted, it is appropriate and
necessary for peace officers to check, confirm, or establish the identity of
accused persons in a wide variety of situations. In urban areas, in particular,
individuals are relatively anonymous. Virtually everywhere the population is
very mobile. Peace officers themselves relocate and find themselves working in
new communities, and thus may fail to recognize even long‑time residents.
In this social context, the fact that accused persons often try to conceal
their true identity or criminal past, and sometimes jeopardize innocent persons
in the process, will very frequently justify the imposition of a requirement to
submit to fingerprinting. That is what the impugned legislation seeks to do.

 

46.        The legislation is not arbitrary in its
scope. The Identification of Criminals Act  and ss. 453.3(3)  and 455.5(5) 
of the Criminal Code  do not create an arbitrary or irrational statutory
scheme. They apply only with respect to three categories of accused persons who
have not been convicted of an indictable offence:

 

(i)     those
whom a peace officer has reasonable and probable grounds to believe have
committed an indictable offence and who are arrested in consequence; (s.
450(1) , Criminal Code )

 

(ii)    those
whom any person has reasonable and probable grounds to believe have committed
an indictable offence, and concerning whom a justice considers that the case
for issuing a summons or a warrant has been made out; (s. 455.3 , Criminal
Code )

 

(iii)   those
charged with an indictable offence to whom a peace officer has issued an
appearance notice, and concerning whom a justice, having heard that the peace
officer has personal knowledge or reasonable and probable grounds for believing
that the accused has committed the offence, considers that the case for
confirming the appearance notice, or for issuing a summons or warrants has been
made out; (ss. 455.1 and 455.4 and Form 2, Criminal Code )

 

47.        The impugned provisions, therefore,
operate only with respect to indictable offences which, obviously, constitute
the most serious category of criminal offences. Moreover, with respect to each
class of accused there must be reasonable and probable grounds to believe that
the persons involved have committed an indictable offence. In the case of the
last two categories noted above, a justice must be satisfied that a case has
been made out for confirming or issuing a process requiring the accused to
appear in court.

 

48.        Nor does the statute grant unlimited
powers to use unrestricted methods to establish identity. Only processes which
have been sanctioned by the Governor in Council are authorized. The processes
that have been approved are universally accepted as reliable and efficient and
as minimally intrusive upon the individual.

 

49.        What troubled the Court of Appeal was not
so much the scope of the legislation, but its differential operation and the
inadequacy of the procedures in this regard. The impugned legislation, the
judges noted, permits the taking of fingerprints; it does not require it. The
police, therefore, have a discretion whether to take or not to take the
fingerprints of an accused. For the Court of Appeal, the failure of the
provisions to either eliminate or to narrow or define the basis of discretion
constituted a violation of fundamental justice. Fingerprints, they stated, can
be demanded even when there is no justification for requiring them. This
problem, they believed, could be solved by requiring an officer to show
reasonable and probable grounds for believing fingerprinting is necessary.

 

50.        The trouble with this approach, in my
respectful view, is that it fails to keep in mind the numerous and varied
functions of fingerprints, and that they may be useful in almost any case. It
could seriously impede criminal investigations to impose rigid guidelines and
place upon the courts the burden of determining on second‑hand knowledge
that fingerprinting does not meet any of the important purposes for which it
might legitimately be used.

 

51.        The existence of the discretion conferred
by the statutory provisions does not, in my view, offend principles of
fundamental justice. Discretion is an essential feature of the criminal justice
system. A system that attempted to eliminate discretion would be unworkably
complex and rigid. Police necessarily exercise discretion in deciding when to
lay charges, to arrest and to conduct incidental searches, as prosecutors do in
deciding whether or not to withdraw a charge, enter a stay, consent to an
adjournment, proceed by way of indictment or summary conviction, launch an
appeal and so on.

 

52.        The Criminal Code  provides no
guidelines for the exercise of discretion in any of these areas. The day to day
operation of law enforcement and the criminal justice system nonetheless
depends upon the exercise of that discretion.

 

53.        This Court has already recognized that
the existence of prosecutorial discretion does not offend the principles of
fundamental justice; see R. v. Lyons, supra, at p. 348; see also R.
v. Jones, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 284, at pp. 303‑4. The Court did add that
if, in a particular case, it was established that a discretion was exercised
for improper or arbitrary motives, a remedy under s. 24  of the Charter 
would lie, but no allegation of this kind has been made in the present case.

 

54.        The judges in the Court of Appeal thought
their objections to the discretionary features of the legislation could be met
if the following conditions were satisfied: a peace officer, in addition to
having reasonable and probable grounds for believing the accused had committed
an offence, had reasonable and probable grounds for believing that
fingerprinting would likely provide evidence relating to the offences, or
reasonably doubted the identity of the accused, or believed on reasonable and
probable grounds that fingerprinting would provide evidence of the subject's
identity. In this context, they cited the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984 (U.K.), c. 60, s. 61, and the Law Reform Commission of Canada's study,
Investigative Tests (1984). I am by no means sure this does not ignore
the wide variety of reasons for which fingerprints may legitimately be used.
Nor am I convinced these additional steps would afford any significant
protection to an accused, and if more stringent requirements were imposed they
could unduly limit the police in the exercise of their duty to investigate
crime; see, in this context, similar considerations expressed in relation to
bodily searches in United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218 (1973), at p.
235, per Rehnquist J., and at pp. 237‑38, per Powell J.
Assuming such procedures (or a provision such as that which appears in the
British Act requiring that a decision to fingerprint be made by a senior
officer) would constitute some improvement to the present unstructured system,
I do not think it is constitutionally mandated. As the Court stated in Lyons,
supra, at p. 362, s. 7  of the Charter  guarantees fair procedures
but it does not guarantee the most favourable procedures that can possibly be
imagined. In my view, the requirements necessary to issue and confirm an
appearance notice offer a sufficient safeguard to meet the requirements of fundamental
justice for the taking of fingerprints.

 

55.        Many of the matters relevant here are
more directly related to the arguments regarding privacy raised in the judgment
of Cameron J.A., a matter to which I now turn.

 

Privacy

 

56.        Cameron J.A. thought the impugned
provisions offended against the principles of fundamental justice by violating
the respondents' privacy, and he here quite legitimately referred to ss. 8  to
14  as ""an invaluable key to the meaning of `principles of fundamental
justice' ''. He particularly relied on this Court's decision in Hunter
v. Southam Inc., supra.

 

57.        I rather think most of the arguments
advanced in this context are fully answered by what has already been said
earlier. I shall nonetheless attempt to deal with them specifically.

 

58.        Assuming section 7 includes a right to
privacy such as that inhering in the guarantee against unreasonable searches
and seizures in s. 8  of the Charter , a proposition for which I have
considerable sympathy, it must be remembered that the present Chief Justice in Southam
was careful to underline that what the Constitution guaranteed was a
""reasonable expectation"" of privacy (at p. 159).

 

59.        It seems to me that a person who is
arrested on reasonable and probable grounds that he has committed a serious
crime, or a person against whom a case for issuing a summons or warrant, or
confirming an appearance notice has been made out, must expect a significant
loss of personal privacy. He must expect that incidental to his being taken in
custody he will be subjected to observation, to physical measurement and the
like. Fingerprinting is of that nature. While some may find it distasteful, it
is insubstantial, of very short duration, and leaves no lasting impression.
There is no penetration into the body and no substance is removed from it.

 

60.        I am unable to accept that a provision
providing for fingerprinting as an incident of being taken into custody for a
serious crime violates the principles of fundamental justice. While a search of
one's premises requires a prior authorization based on reasonable and probable
grounds to believe both that the offence has been committed and that evidence
will be found, the custodial fingerprinting process is entirely different. It
involves none of the probing into an individual's private life and effects that
mark a search.

 

61.        Apart from this, the invasion of privacy
on arrest on reasonable and probable grounds is a far more serious violation of
the right to privacy. It is not significantly aggravated by the taking of the
fingerprints of the person in custody. As already mentioned, there are many
cases where the United States courts, including the Supreme Court, have refused
to accord constitutional protection against a general discretion in the police
to take fingerprints from persons in custody; see Moenssens, supra, at
pp. 62‑70.

 

Retention of Prints

 

62.        Finally, the Court of Appeal was much
affected by the fact that there was no provision for the destruction of the
fingerprints of an accused who was not convicted. This issue raises important
considerations, but it does not arise on the facts of the present case. The
fingerprints of the respondents were never taken so they could not, therefore,
be retained. I rather doubt that s. 2  of the Identification of Criminals Act 
deals with this at all, but if it does it has nothing to do with the taking of
fingerprints which is covered by ss. 2(1)  and (2) . Section 2(3)  does provide
for publication of the results of tests for the purpose of affording
information for those engaged in the execution or administration of the law,
but I do not think it authorizes their unconstitutional retention.

 

Other Charter Rights

 

63.        In the courts below, counsel relied on
ss. 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 (c) and (d) in addition to s. 7  of the Charter .
No argument was addressed to this Court on any of these issues, although
counsel for Beare declared he had not abandoned them. In the absence of
argument, it is difficult to deal with these issues and I propose to do so as
best I can in the most narrow and summary fashion possible.

 

64.        Section 8  guarantees the right to be
secure against unreasonable search and seizure. Assuming fingerprinting can be
looked upon as a search (a view which has been rejected in those cases that
have considered it; see R. v. McGregor (1983), 3 C.C.C. (3d) 200 (Ont.
H.C.), and Re M. H. and The Queen (No. 2) (1984), 17 C.C.C. (3d) 443)
(Alta. Q.B.), aff'd without written reasons (1985), 21 C.C.C. (3d) 384 (Alta.
C.A.), leave to appeal to this Court granted September 19, 1985, [1985] 2
S.C.R. ix), it seems clear that fingerprinting would not be unreasonable in the
present cases for the same reasons that it does not violate the principles of
fundamental justice.

 

65.        Section 9  gives the right not to be
arbitrarily detained or imprisoned. I have largely dealt with this issue in
examining arbitrariness in relation to s. 7 . Apart from that, its relevance is
not immediately apparent. The respondents could have been arrested on the basis
that there was reasonable and probable cause for their arrests and, as I noted
earlier, I cannot see how they can complain about a procedure that permits
their not being arrested under the provisions of the Bail Reform Act
subject to their being required to comply with an appearance notice to present
themselves to conform to a procedure for which they could be subjected if they
had been arrested; see in this context Re Jamieson and The Queen (1982),
70 C.C.C. (2d) 430 (Que. S.C.), Re McGregor, supra, and R. v.
Halpern (1986), 73 A.R. 276 (Q.B.)

 

66.        I am unable to grasp the significance of
s. 10  (the right to counsel) to these issues in the circumstances of these
cases. Nor do I see how the respondents could be said to be witnesses in
proceedings against themselves under s. 11 (c) of the Charter  (see
Re Jamieson and The Queen, supra; see also the cases on the much
broader provision of the Fifth Amendment against self‑incrimination in
the United States Constitution, particularly Schmerber v. California,
384 U.S. 757 (1966), at p. 764, discussed in Moenssens, supra, at
pp. 62‑66.

 

67.        Section 11 (d) guarantees a fair
trial. If the fingerprints were obtained in a manner consistent with the
principles of fundamental justice, it is not readily apparent how their use as
evidence could affect the fairness of a trial.

 

Section 1  of the Charter 

 

68.        Since I have determined that the taking
of fingerprints in the present cases does not violate the principles of
fundamental justice within the meaning of s. 7  of the Charter , it
becomes unnecessary to consider s. 1  of the Charter .

 

Disposition

 

69.        Since the Court has already allowed the
appeals, it only remains to reply to the constitutional questions and to
dispose of the matter of costs. For the reasons given, I would reply to the
first constitutional question in each case in the negative. It, therefore,
becomes unnecessary to deal with the second constitutional questions. As to
costs, I see no reason to depart from the ordinary practice in these matters,
and I would make no order as to costs.

Jurisdiction ‑‑ Appeal from summary conviction appeal court ‑‑
Jurisdiction of Court of Appeal.

 

                   Appellant was convicted in
Provincial Court on two counts of unlawful possession of a restricted weapon.
The original owner had purchased the weapons in the United States, had
registered them in Canada when he moved to Winnipeg, and had given the
registration papers, which were in his name, to appellant when appellant bought
the weapons. Appellant's application for a firearms acquisition certificate was
refused by the Winnipeg Police. The police later searched appellant's home and
confiscated the restricted weapons. The convictions were quashed by the summary
conviction appeal court but were restored by the Court of Appeal. The
constitutional question before the Court dealt with whether s. 106.7(1)  of the Criminal
Code  contravened s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms . Also at issue was whether the Court of Appeal erred in deciding
the appeal on a question of fact or, in the alternative, on a question of mixed
fact and law.

 

                   Held (Dickson C.J. and Lamer J. dissenting): The
appeal should be dismissed. The constitutional question should be answered in
the negative.

 

                   Per McIntyre, La Forest and L'Heureux‑Dubé
JJ.: A question of law involving the admissibility of evidence was raised here.
To set aside an acquittal, the Crown must satisfy the Court that the result
would not necessarily have been the same if the error made at trial had not
occurred. The Crown met that test.

 

                   Parliament in enacting Part
II.1 of the Criminal Code  intended to prohibit the acquisition and use
of weapons except as permitted by the strict controls it prescribed. Only a
person possessing a restricted weapon for which he has no registration
certificate can be convicted under s. 89(1). If a certificate of registration
is not obtained, a criminal offence arises from the mere possession of the
restricted firearm. Far from reversing any onus, s. 106.7 provides that a
document purporting to be a valid registration certificate is evidence and
proof of the statements contained therein and exempts an accused from
prosecution.

 

                   Although the accused must
establish that he falls within the exemption, there is no danger that he could
be convicted under s. 89(1), despite the existence of a reasonable doubt as to
guilt, because the production of the certificate resolves all doubts in favour
of the accused and in the absence of the certificate no defence is possible
once possession has been shown.

 

                   It was not necessary to
consider s. 1  here. The impugned legislation, however, did meet the Oakes
test. Firstly, its objective was sufficiently important to warrant overriding a
constitutionally protected right. Secondly, the proportionality test was met.
The provisions were rational, fair and not arbitrary; they impaired the
protected right as little as possible; and, the measures adopted were carefully
tailored to balance the community interest and the interest of those wanting to
legally possess weapons.

 

                   Per Beetz J.: Given the dates of pre‑Charter 
trial and post‑Charter  summary conviction appeal, it was assumed
without deciding that the Charter  applied; the reasons of McIntyre J.
were concurred in.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. (dissenting): Any burden on the
accused that permits a conviction despite the presence of a reasonable doubt
violates the presumption of innocence, regardless of the nature of the point
the accused was required to prove. Otherwise, an accused, forced but unable to
persuade the finder of fact of his or her innocence on a balance of
probabilities, would be convicted of a criminal offence despite the existence
of a reasonable doubt as to his or her guilt. The differences between defences
which deny the existence of an essential element of an offence and defences
that admit the existence of those elements do not affect the review of a
provision under s. 11 (d). When the facts give rise to the possibility of
either type of defence, the Crown should be required to disprove them by proof
of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

                   Lack of registration, whether
or not it is an ""essential element"" of s. 89(1) of the Code,
is essential to the verdict. Section 106.7(1)  relieves the Crown of the onus of
proof beyond a reasonable doubt and requires the person charged under s. 89(1)
to ""prove"" possession of a registration certificate on a balance of
probabilities. The accused, therefore, is required to raise a more than a
reasonable doubt. An accused, unable to meet this persuasive burden, could be
convicted of unlawful possession of a restricted weapon notwithstanding the
potential existence of a reasonable doubt.

 

                   The presumption of innocence
guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter  is not subject to statutory
or common law exceptions and is infringed by any provision requiring that the
accused bear a persuasive burden. In some instances, however, the accused may
be required to point out some evidential basis to raise a defence which the
Crown must then disprove beyond a reasonable doubt. Factors such as ease of
proof and a rational connection go to the justification for an infringement and
should be considered in the s. 1  analysis.

 

                   The Code contains a
comprehensive `gun control' legislative scheme intended to discourage the use
of firearms. The objective behind Part II.1 in general and s. 106.7(1)  in
particular relates to concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and
democratic society. The proportionality test in Oakes, however, was not
met. There was no rational connection between the provision and the objective.
The proved fact (possession of a restricted weapon) did not prove the presumed
fact (lack of a registration certificate). The presumption of innocence was not
impaired ""as little as possible"" by the challenged provision. To
authenticate the certificate, the accused must testify (and so choose between
his constitutionally guaranteed rights not to testify or to be presumed
innocent) or call the local registrar of firearms as a defence witness. The
Crown can disprove the existence of a registration certificate with information
from the local registrar of firearms as to whether or not a certificate has
been issued and, as a backup, from the central registry of all registration
certificates.

 

                   Section 106.7(1)  is not
completely invalid notwithstanding the invalidity of its application here.
While the nature of the registration figured highly in the s. 1  analysis here,
the justification for s. 106.7(1)  in connection with other documents or permits
in Part II.1 could likely involve different issues and a different s. 1 
analysis.

 

                   Per Lamer J. (dissenting): The disposition and the
reasons of the Chief Justice, except for the objective assigned to s. 106.7
under the s. 1  scrutiny, were concurred in.

 

                   Section 106.7(1)  is neither
particular nor essential to weapons legislation. It is a purely evidentiary
section intended to relieve the prosecution of the inconvenience of securing a
certificate from the appropriate authority attesting to the absence of any
record establishing registration. The objective, when the cost of this
convenience is expressed in terms of a restriction on an accused's rights, was
not sufficiently important to warrant overriding an accused's rights under s.
11 (d).

                   APPEAL from a judgment of the
Manitoba Court of Appeal (1983), 25 Man. R. (2d) 295 (on a rehearing following
a preliminary judgment of that Court (1983), 25 Man. R. (2d) 164, 5 D.L.R.
(4th) 524) allowing an appeal from a decision of Barkman Co. Ct. J. (1983), 22
Man. R. (2d) 46, allowing an appeal from conviction by Allen Prov. Ct. J.
Appeal dismissed, Dickson C.J. and Lamer J. dissenting. The constitutional
question should be answered in the negative.

 

                   J. J. Gindin, for the appellant.

 

                   Bruce Miller, for the respondent.

 

                   Julius A. Isaac and Yvon Vanasse, for the intervener the
Attorney General of Canada.

 

                   The following are the reasons
delivered by

 

1.                       The Chief Justice
(dissenting)‑‑Section 106.7(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C‑34, requires an accused charged with a firearms offence to
prove that he or she held the necessary permit or certificate for the firearm.
The constitutional validity of this section is the primary question in this
case. A secondary question is raised as to the jurisdiction of a provincial
court of appeal on an appeal from a summary conviction appeal court. At the
outset, I would like to mention that this case has been argued throughout on
the basis of s. 106.7(1). Section 730 of the Code has not been in issue.

Facts

 

2.                       Arnold
Godfried Schwartz was charged under s. 89(1)  of the Criminal Code  (i)
that he did unlawfully have in his possession a restricted weapon, to wit: a
.44 Magnum revolver for which he did not have a registration certificate issued
to him; (ii) that he did unlawfully have in his possession a restricted weapon,
to wit: a .38 Special revolver for which he did not have a registration
certificate issued to him. The evidence disclosed that Schwartz had bought the
two handguns in 1978 from one of his employees, Horst Schimiczek, who had
acquired the .38 Special in Texas and the .44 Magnum in North Dakota.
Schimiczek had moved to Winnipeg, duly registered the two weapons, and then
sold the guns to Schwartz. He gave Schwartz the registration papers, in
Schimiczek's name. Later, an application in Schwartz's name for a firearms
acquisition certificate, the necessary first step to obtain a registration
certificate, was received by the Firearms Section of the City of Winnipeg
Police Department. At the time, the Firearms Section was under control of Staff
Sergeant Gordon Pilcher, who reviewed the application and determined that a
notice of intention to refuse a firearms acquisition certificate should be sent
to Schwartz. A notice to this effect was delivered to Schwartz by double registered
mail.

 

3.                       Approximately
nine months after the notice was mailed, members of the Winnipeg Police
Department executed a search of Schwartz's home, and located and confiscated a
.44 Magnum and a .38 Special.

 

4.                       Schwartz
proceeded to trial before Allen Prov. Ct. J. and was convicted on both charges.
He was fined $50 on each charge. On appeal, Barkman Co. Ct. J. allowed the
appeal and quashed the convictions. The Crown then appealed to the Manitoba
Court of Appeal (Hall J.A., Matas J.A. concurring, and Huband J.A. dissenting
in part). The acquittals were set aside and convictions restored. Leave was
granted by this Court to appeal the judgment of the Manitoba Court of Appeal.

Legislative and
Constitutional Provisions

 

5.                       The
relevant legislative and constitutional provisions follow:

 

Criminal Code 

 

        89. (1) Every one who has in his possession a restricted weapon
for which he does not have a registration certificate

 

(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for five years; or

 

(b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

 

        106.7 (1) Where, in any proceedings under any of sections 83 to
106.5, any question arises as to whether a person is or was the holder of a
firearms acquisition certificate, registration certificate or permit, the onus
is on the accused to prove that that person is or was the holder of such
firearms acquisition certificate, registration certificate or permit.

 

        (2) In any proceedings under any of sections 83 to 106.5,
a document purporting to be a firearms acquisition certificate, registration
certificate or permit is evidence of the statements contained therein.

 

Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms 

 

        1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  guarantees the
rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits
prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society.

 

        11. Any person charged with an offence has the right

 

                          ...

 

(d) to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according
to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal;

 

                          III

 

Judgments of the Manitoba
Courts

 

Provincial Judges Court

 

6.                       Allen
Prov. Ct. J. found the appellant guilty on both counts. He stated, in part:

 

The fact is there comes a situation in each case where the evidence is
so overwhelming and points clearly in one direction that one would have to
speculate and resort to pure conjecture to have a reasonable doubt. I do not
have a reasonable doubt.

 

7.                       Section
106.7(1) of the Code, imposing an onus on the accused, does not appear
to have been raised in argument in support of the case for the Crown nor relied
upon by Allen Prov. Ct. J. The constitutional validity of the section was not
challenged before him.

 

County Court of Winnipeg

 

8.                       There
were three major grounds of appeal before Barkman Co. Ct. J. [(1983), 22 Man.
R. (2d) 46]. The first was that it was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt
that the accused possessed the restricted weapons. The second was that some of
the evidence concerning the lack of registration was hearsay and therefore
inadmissible. The third ground was that the evidence concerning lack of
registration could only be admitted if notice were given under s. 30 of the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑10.

 

9.                       Defence
counsel objected to the admission of evidence of Sergeant Pilcher relating to
information contained in a file compiled by staff members under his
supervision. Counsel also objected to Sgt. Pilcher testifying about any
documents that might have been placed in the file after he was transferred out
of the Firearms Section. Barkman Co. Ct. J. held that the trial judge erred by
admitting the evidence of Sgt. Pilcher which did not relate specifically to
things done by Pilcher himself; Sgt. Pilcher had gone on to other duties; such
evidence was hearsay and could only be admitted after giving notice pursuant to
s. 30  of the Canada Evidence Act .

 

10.                     Barkman
Co. Ct. J. considered as properly admitted the evidence of Sgt. Pilcher to the
effect that (1) he refused an application by the accused for a firearms
acquisition certificate; (2) he wrote a refusal letter; (3) he searched the
file of the city of Winnipeg Police regarding the accused in 1979 and did not
find a registration certificate for a restricted weapon, and he had the file
with him in court; (4) the address of the house of the accused was situated in
the city of Winnipeg area for registration of firearms. According to the
evidence, no one to whom a certificate had been refused could get a certificate
during the five years following. The evidence of Sgt. Pilcher was the only
evidence before the judge relating to the registration of the restricted
weapons, except for the evidence of the previous owner, Mr. Schimiczek, who testified
that he spoke to the accused about registration of the weapons in the early
part of 1981 and the accused then told him that he had not yet registered them.

 

11.                     Barkman
Co. Ct. J. further held [at p. 48] that Sgt. Pilcher could give evidence as to
what he did and saw personally, but ""his evidence as to what he saw is not
evidence of the truth of the information contained in the documents which he
saw in the file in question"". He held that Allen Prov. Ct. J. had
improperly admitted as an exhibit the application for a firearms acquisition
certificate in Schwartz's name as it had not been identified by the person
receiving it as having been submitted by Schwartz. He concluded [at p. 49] that
the remaining evidence, together with the testimony of Schimiczek, ""falls
far short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did not have
registration certificates issued to him for the restricted
weapons . . . .""

 

12.                     Counsel
for the Crown, after arguing unsuccessfully against the exclusion of the so‑called
hearsay evidence, then contended that even if such evidence were not
admissible, this would not affect the conviction of the appellant because s.
106.7(1) of the Code placed the onus on the accused to satisfy the Court
that the weapons were properly registered. Counsel for Schwartz argued in
response that s. 106.7(1) of the Code was either inapplicable to his
client or unconstitutional by reason of s. 11 (d) of the Charter .
Barkman Co. Ct. J. held that s. 106.7(1)  was not ambiguous and that it
applied to the appellant. He then went on to consider the judgment of the
Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Oakes (1983), 145 D.L.R. (3d) 123,
aff'd [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103. Barkman Co. Ct. J. referred to the three factors
mentioned by Martin J.A. in Oakes, underlined in the passage below, at
pp. 50‑51, to be taken into consideration in determining whether it is
reasonable for Parliament to place the burden of proof on the accused in
relation to an ingredient of the offences in question:

 

(a) the magnitude of the evil sought to be suppressed, it
is to my mind a great evil that is sought to be suppressed by the requirement
of registration of restricted weapons since registration will not be granted
where a person has within the last five years (1) been convicted of an offence
on indictment in which violence against another person was used, threatened or
attempted; etc (see s. 194(3)(b)); (b) the difficulty of the prosecution
making proof of the presumed fact. Since the advent of the computer and in
accordance with the evidence of Sergeant Pilcher that records are maintained in
Ottawa as to persons who are refused certificates or permits, it would not be
difficult for the Crown to prove lack of registration; (c) the relative ease
with which the accused may prove or disprove the presumed fact. The accused
need only produce the registration certificate or permit to prove the
registration (see s. 106.7(2)) in the circumstances of this case, but in other
situations it may be more difficult. [Emphasis added.]

 

13.                     Barkman
Co. Ct. J. went on to point out that the circumstances of the case before him
were such as to satisfy the threshold question of legitimacy of the reverse
onus. However, this provision also applied to ss. 89(3), 91(1), and 94(1).
Under these sections it could be very difficult for the accused to prove the
fact of registration by another person. He held that (a) there was no rational
connection between the proven fact (possession) and the presumed fact (lack of
registration), and (b) in applying the reverse onus to all of ss. 83 to 106.5,
it may be impossible for an accused to prove the fact of registration. Section
106.7(1) was therefore constitutionally invalid. He concluded that the trial
judge erred by admitting hearsay evidence and that s. 106.7(1) did not apply
because it offended s. 11 (d) of the Charter . Barkman Co. Ct. J.
allowed the appeal and quashed the conviction.

 

Manitoba Court of Appeal

 

14.                     The
ground of appeal taken to the Manitoba Court of Appeal was in these terms:

 

THAT the learned County Court Judge erred in law in ruling Section
106.7(1)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada was unconstitutional in that the
said section contravened the provisions of Section 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

15.                     It
would appear that before the Court of Appeal of Manitoba, counsel agreed to
argue only the constitutional question. This was entirely appropriate as
appeals to the Court of Appeal from a summary conviction appeal court are
limited to questions of law. In a preliminary judgment by the Manitoba Court of
Appeal ((1983), 25 Man. R. (2d) 164), Matas J.A. stated, at p. 166:

 

...the decision of Barkman, C.C.C.J., on the constitutional point is
inextricably linked to the question of law arising out of the first question
[the evidentiary question]. Implicit in the acquittal based on the
constitutional question is the decision of the learned Chief County Court judge
on the admissibility of evidence given at the trial by Sergeant Pilcher, the
officer in charge of the firearms section and applications for firearms
acquisitions and permits for restricted weapons in the City of Winnipeg. In my
opinion, it is inappropriate for this court to consider constitutional
questions in the context of a prosecution unless all the available material is
properly before the court. In order to have a decision of this court, based on
all the available material, I would grant leave to the Crown to argue the
evidentiary point.

 

He therefore adjourned the
disposition of the appeal pending re‑hearing.

 

16.                     Upon
the re‑hearing, the Court of Appeal ((1983), 25 Man. R. (2d) 295),
allowed the Crown's appeal (Huband J.A. dissenting in part). Hall J.A. held
that Barkman Co. Ct. J. erred in law by ruling inadmissible certain evidence
given by Sgt. Pilcher. He further held at p. 297 that ""the evidence of
Sergeant Pilcher and that of the witness Schimiczek is sufficient to support
the implicit finding of the learned trial judge that no registration
certificates had ever been issued to the accused for the restricted weapons and
that therefore he was not the holder of such
certificates . . . ."" Though he was of the view that
it was unnecessary to decide the issue, Hall J.A. agreed with Huband J.A.'s conclusion,
discussed below, that s. 106.7(1)  was a reasonable limit on the presumption of
innocence. Matas J.A. concurred with Hall J.A. on the evidentiary issue but
expressed no opinion on the constitutional point.

 

17.                     Huband
J.A., dissenting in part, disagreed with Hall J.A.'s conclusion on the evidence
and therefore felt it incumbent to rule on the constitutionality of s.
106.7(1) . In Huband J.A.'s view, there was an added reason to address the
constitutional issue. The appeal to the Court of Appeal, pursuant to s. 771 of
the Code, was on a question of law alone. He stated, at p. 299, that
""The consideration of Staff Sergeant Pilcher's evidence involves the court
in a question of sufficiency of evidence which ... is a question of fact rather
than law.""

 

18.                     Relying
on R. v. Appleby, [1972] S.C.R. 303, and refusing to follow the Ontario
Court of Appeal's approach in R. v. Oakes, supra, Huband J.A.
held that s. 106.7(1)  does not contravene the presumption of innocence
according to law. In the alternative, he was of the view that, although it is
true that mere possession of a restricted weapon does not logically lead to an
inference that the weapon is unregistered, ""proof of registration is so
easily provided by the accused himself that it becomes reasonable to require an
accused to answer an onus upon him at that point"". Huband J.A. therefore
would have allowed the appeal relying on s. 106.7(1) of the Code.

 

19.                     It
is difficult to find a common thread in any of the issues in any of the
decisions of the Manitoba courts. The court of first instance found the accused
guilty on the evidence presented, without recourse to s. 106.7(1) of the Code.
On appeal, Barkman Co. Ct. J. held that the evidence of the lack of a
registration certificate was inadequate in the absence of s. 106.7(1)  and that
that section was unconstitutional. He held that the ease of proof concerning
possession of a permit was not difficult for the police but utterly impossible
for an accused if one looked at all of the offences to which s. 106.7(1) 
applied. Moving to the Court of Appeal, the picture is less clear. Hall J.A.
concluded that the Crown succeeded on the evidential point and although it was
therefore unnecessary to consider s. 106.7(1) , he would nonetheless have upheld
it. Matas J.A. was content to leave the constitutional point to another day and
resolved the case simply on the evidentiary point. Finally, Huband J.A., in
dissent on this point, would appear to have shared the views of Barkman Co. Ct.
J. on the evidentiary point. Although he would have resolved the evidentiary
point in favour of the accused, he would uphold s. 106.7(1)  and find the
accused guilty.

 

                           IV

 

Issues

 

20.                     Before
this Court, a constitutional question was stated as follows:

 

Is section 106.7(1) of the Criminal Code  of Canada
constitutionally invalid in that it contravenes the provisions of s. 11 (d)
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

The Attorney General of
Canada and the Attorneys General of Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario
served notices of intervention. All the provincial Attorneys General
subsequently withdrew their interventions.

 

21.                     In
addition to the constitutional question, the appellant submits that the Court
of Appeal erred in deciding the appeal on a question of fact or, in the
alternative, on a question of mixed fact and law. I propose first to address
this latter issue, and then turn to the constitutional issue in this appeal. I
note that although the trial in the Provincial Court occurred before the Charter 
came into force, no issue was raised as to whether s. 11 (d) should
apply, all subsequent proceedings having taken place after April 17, 1982.

 

                           V

 

The Jurisdiction of the Court
of Appeal

 

22.                     The
appellant submits that the Court of Appeal erred in deciding the appeal on a
question of fact or mixed fact and law, namely, the sufficiency of evidence.
The respondent Crown submits, however, that the Court of Appeal was faced with
a question involving the admissibility, not sufficiency, of evidence; the
question before the Court of Appeal was a question of law; as a result that
court had jurisdiction to hear the case.

 

23.                     The
notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal filed by the Deputy Attorney General
for Manitoba, reproduced above, alleged that Barkman Co. Ct. J. erred in law in
holding s. 106.7(1) unconstitutional. In addition, the appeal was ""upon
any other point in law the evidence may disclose"". The Crown appeal was
pursuant to s. 771 of the Code, limiting the jurisdiction of the Court
of Appeal to questions of law alone. As stated earlier, the Court of Appeal, per
Matas J.A., granted leave to argue ""the evidentiary point."" It is in
relation to the Court of Appeal's reasons given after the rehearing that the
appellant alleges that the Court of Appeal decided the case on a question of
fact or, in the alternative, mixed law and fact. Section 771(2) of the Code
provides that ""Sections 601 to 616 apply mutatis mutandis to an
appeal under this section."" It is well‑settled that the question
whether a trial verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence
is not a ""question of law"" under s. 605(1)(a) of the Code.
Sufficiency of proof is a question of fact reserved for the trial judge. See Sunbeam
Corporation (Canada) Ltd. v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 221, and Rose v.
The Queen, [1959] S.C.R. 441.

 

24.                     It
should be noted, however, that a summary conviction appeal court is not
restricted to questions of law alone. Section 755(1) of the Code
provides that in appeals from a summary conviction, ""sections 610 to 616,
with the exception of subsections 610(3) and 613(5), apply mutatis mutandis"".
Section 613(1)(a) permits a summary conviction appeal court to allow an
appeal if the verdict is ""unreasonable or cannot be supported by the
evidence"" or if the trial judge erred ""on a question of law"" (R.
v. Ponsford (1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d) 433 (Alta. C.A.)) This is not to say
that a summary conviction appeal court is entitled to retry the case (R. v.
Colbeck (1978), 42 C.C.C. (2d) 117 (Ont. C.A.))

 

25.                     Counsel
for the appellant refers to several passages of the reasons of the Court of
Appeal in support of his submission that the court decided the appeal on a
question of fact. Hall J.A., for example, stated the first of the two issues in
the following terms:

 

(1) did the learned judge of appeal err in finding that the
evidence fell short of providing beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did
not have registration certificates issued to him for the restricted weapons...?

 

Moreover, Hall J.A. stated
that ""the evidence of Sergeant Pilcher and that of the witness
Schimiczek is sufficient to support the implicit finding of the learned trial
judge that no registration certificates had ever been issued to the accused for
the restricted weapons . . . ."" Matas J.A. concurred
with this part of Hall J.A.'s reasons, stating that ""on the evidentiary
issue the appeal of the Crown should be allowed and the conviction
restored"". The appellant also relies on Huband J.A.'s statement that
""The consideration of Staff Sergeant Pilcher's evidence involves the court
in a question of sufficiency of evidence which ... is a question of fact rather
than law"".

 

26.                     It
cannot be denied, however, that the examination of the sufficiency of evidence
by Hall J.A. occurred in the context of his finding that Barkman Co. Ct. J.
erred in law ""by ruling inadmis­sible certain unspecified evidence of
Sergeant Pilcher relating to information contained in a file compiled by staff
members under his supervision on the ground that it did not relate specifically
to things done by him and was therefore hearsay and could only be admitted
under s. 30  of the Canada Evidence Act "". The majority of the Court
of Appeal was correct in assuming, and the Crown correct in submitting, that
the absence of legal justification for admitting evidence at trial involves a
question of law.

 

27.                     Assuming
the Court of Appeal to be correct on its disposition of this question of law,
however, the court in my view erred by proceeding to reverse the acquittal
without relying on s. 106.7(1) of the Code. Although the appeal before
Barkman Co. Ct. J. was not de novo, the combined effect of s. 771(1) and
(2), s. 755(1), and s. 613(1)(a) is that for purposes of review, the
findings of Barkman Co. Ct. J. are to be treated as if they were the findings
of a judge at first instance. Before it can set aside the decision of the
summary conviction appeal court acquitting the accused, the Court of Appeal
must be satisfied that Barkman Co. Ct. J. would have convicted Schwartz but for
his decision that the trial judge erred in the admission of hearsay evidence: Vézeau
v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277.

 

28.                     Barkman
Co. Ct. J. had before him the bulk of Sgt. Pilcher's evidence. His summary of
the evidence which he admitted shows that the only major piece of evidence
excluded was the application for a firearms acquisition certificate. Taken as a
whole, the evidence is ambivalent whether a firearms acquisition certificate,
and later on the registration certificate, might have been issued to the
accused some time after 1979, when Sgt. Pilcher was no longer in charge of the
file. To set aside the acquittals the jurisprudence of this Court requires that
the Crown satisfy the Court that the verdict would not necessarily have been
the same had the trial judge not erred with respect to the evidentiary issue.
In my view, the Crown did not satisfy that onus and it cannot be said with any
degree of certainty that Barkman Co. Ct. J. would have upheld the convictions
but for his decision to exclude some of the evidence. Hall J.A. in my opinion
therefore erred by entering a conviction without finding it necessary to resort
to the ""reverse onus"" provision of s. 106.7(1). This Court must
consider the application, and hence the constitutionality, of s. 106.7(1).

 

                           VI

 

Constitutional Issues:
Section 11 (d) and the Presumption of Innocence

 

29.                     In
R. v. Oakes, supra, R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
636, R. v. Holmes, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 914, R. v. Whyte, [1988] 2
S.C.R. 3, this Court had occasion to address in detail the scope of the s. 11 (d)
Charter  right ""to be presumed innocent until proven guilty
according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial
tribunal"", and there is no need to review at length the principles
contained in those cases. It suffices to say that Oakes stands for the
proposition that ""a provision which requires an accused to disprove on a
balance of probabilities the evidence of a presumed fact, which is an important
element of the offence in question, violates the presumption of innocence in
s. 11 (d)"" (p. 132). Similarly in Vaillancourt,
Lamer J. held, for the majority on this point, that the presumption of innocence
requires that the trier of fact be convinced of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt
(at p. 655):

 

Any provision creating an offence which allows for the conviction of an
accused notwithstanding the existence of a reasonable doubt on any essential
element infringes ss. 7  and 11 (d).

 

        Clearly, this will occur where the provision requires the
accused to disprove on a balance of probabilities an essential element of the
offence by requiring that he raise more that just a reasonable doubt.

 

30.                     In
Holmes, two members of the Court took the view that any burden on the
accused that permitted a conviction despite the presence of a reasonable doubt
violated the presumption of innocence, regardless of the nature of the point
the accused was required to prove. In Whyte, this theme was repeated. In
response to the argument that the presumption of innocence only requires the
Crown to prove the essential elements of an offence, the Chief Justice said at
p. 18:

 

        The short answer to this argument is that the distinction
between elements of the offence and other aspects of the charge is irrelevant
to the s. 11 (d) inquiry. The real concern is not whether the accused
must disprove an element or prove an excuse, but that an accused may be
convicted while a reasonable doubt exists. When the possibility exists, there
is a breach of the presumption of innocence.

 

        The exact characterization of a factor as an essential element,
a collateral factor, an excuse, or a defence should not affect the analysis of
the presumption of innocence. It is the final effect of a provision on the
verdict that is decisive. If an accused is required to prove some fact on the
balance of probabilities to avoid conviction, the provision violates the
presumption of innocence because it permits a conviction in spite of a
reasonable doubt in the mind of the trier of fact as to the guilt of the
accused. The trial of an accused in a criminal matter cannot be divided neatly
into stages, with the onus of proof on the accused at an intermediate stage and
the ultimate onus on the Crown.

 

(See also Donald Stuart, Canadian
Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1987), at pp. 388‑91; Richard Mahoney,
""The Presumption of Innocence: A New Era"" (1988), 67 Can. Bar Rev.
1, at pp. 4‑13). To hold otherwise would result in the unacceptable
situation that an accused, forced but unable to persuade the finder of fact of
his or her innocence on a balance of probabilities, will be convicted of a
criminal offence despite the existence of a reasonable doubt as to his or her
guilt.

 

31.                     The
cornerstone of our theory of criminal liability is that society should only
sanction those people who are personally guilty of breaking the law. Only when
guilt is established can society justly impose criminal penalties. This
principle permeates the criminal law and is one of the basic premises of the
presumption of innocence. It follows that the Crown is required to prove the
guilt of the accused and bears this burden for all the issues raised by a
charge. In this respect, a criminal prosecution is fundamentally different from
a civil suit, which serves different ends and operates on different
assumptions. Theories of proof in civil suits, under both common law and civil
law, have been strongly influenced by Roman law, which requires the defendant
to raise and prove exceptions to a suit. (See David Finley, ""The
Presumption of Innocence and Guilt"" (1984), 39 C.R. (3d) 115.) Shifting
the onus of proof is acceptable in civil actions, as the well‑known maxim
res ipsa loquitur shows.

 

32.                     Over
the years, some evidentiary rules of private law have crept into the criminal
law, notably reversals of the onus of proof. These influences from civil
actions are now subject to review under the Charter , particularly the
guarantee of the presumption of innocence. In the final result, if a rule of
evidence results in the possibility of a conviction in spite of a reasonable
doubt, the presumption of innocence is violated. The exact role that a rule of
evidence plays in the prosecution does not matter. The Court in Whyte
recognized that there are differences between defences which deny the existence
of an essential element of an offence and defences that admit the existence of
those elements, but held that that difference does not affect the review of a
provision under s. 11 (d). Both types of defences assert innocence; both
deny guilt. When the facts give rise to the possibility of either type of
defence, the Crown should be required to disprove them. Laws governing criminal
liability should not be analyzed in private law terms as rules and exceptions.
All substantive issues raised in a criminal prosecution are related to the
fundamental issue of guilt and innocence. They should all be decided by the
same standard, proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

33.                     Viewed
in this light, it matters little whether or not the lack of registration is an
""essential element"" of s. 89(1) of the Code. It is essential
to the verdict. If the lack of registration is an essential element of the
offence, then s. 106.7(1) relieves the Crown of the onus of proof of part of
the offence charged. If a registration certificate is simply a defence to the
charge, then the Crown is not required to disprove that defence beyond a
reasonable doubt, which it is normally required to do. However the question of
registration is characterized, s. 106.7(1) relieves the Crown of the onus of
proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The section places the onus on a person
charged under s. 89(1)  to ""prove"" that he or she is or was the holder
of a registration certificate. This Court in R. v. Appleby, supra,
and again in R. v. Whyte, supra, held that statutory provisions
requiring the accused to ""prove"" or ""establish"" some fact
cannot be read as simply imposing an evidential burden on the accused. When a
statute requires the accused to establish or prove something, the accused must
do more than raise a reasonable doubt. The accused must establish the required
fact on a balance of probabilities. Section 106.7(1) must therefore be
understood as requiring an accused charged under s. 89(1)  to establish on a
balance of probabilities that he or she held a registration certificate for the
restricted weapon. Thus, s. 106.7(1) embraces the possibility that an accused
unable to meet this persuasive burden will be convicted of unlawful possession
of a restricted weapon contrary to s. 89(1) , despite the potential existence of
a reasonable doubt that the possession was in fact lawful.

 

34.                     The
Attorney General of Canada argues that the presumption of innocence entrenched
by s. 11 (d) of the Charter  is subject to exceptions that the
common law has always recognized. One of these exceptions, it is argued, is
that the common law requires an accused to prove that he or she comes within a
statutory exception or proviso, especially when licences or other privileges
are involved. The Attorney General argues that s. 106.7(1)  is nothing more than
a statutory version of this common law rule and is therefore consistent with s.
11 (d) of the Charter . The Attorney General of Canada referred the
court to R. v. Edwards, [1974] 2 All E.R. 1085 (C.A. Cr. Div.), R. v.
Lee's Poultry Ltd. (1985), 43 C.R. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.), and Halsbury's
Laws of England, vol. 11, 4th ed., para. 357, in support of this
proposition.

 

35.                     It
is worth noting that Professor Glanville Williams has some critical words for
Parliaments and courts alike that are too quick to allow exceptions to the
basic principle that the Crown bears the onus of proof:

 

        When it is said that a defendant to a criminal charge is
presumed to be innocent, what is really meant is that the burden of proving his
guilt is upon the prosecution. This golden thread, as Lord Sankey expressed it,
runs through the web of the English criminal law. Unhappily, Parliament regards
the principle with indifference‑‑one might almost say with
contempt. The Statute Book contains many offences in which the burden of
proving his innocence is cast on the accused. In addition, the courts have
enunciated principles that have the effect of shifting the burden in particular
classes of case.

 

        The sad thing is that there has never been any reason of
expediency for these departures from the cherished principle; it has been done
through carelessness and lack of subtlety. What lies at the bottom of the
various rules shifting the burden of proof is the idea that it is impossible
for the prosecution to give wholly convincing evidence on certain issues from
its own hand, and it is therefore for the accused to give evidence on them if
he wishes to escape. This idea is perfectly defensible and needs to be
expressed in legal rules, but it is not the same as the burden of proof.

 

(Glanville Williams, The
Proof of Guilt (3rd ed. 1963), pp. 184‑85). The author goes on to
argue that it is consistent with the presumption of innocence to expect the
accused to point out evidence that puts in play a particular defence, but it is
neither necessary nor desirable that the accused be required to prove anything.
If the evidence suggests a defence, the Crown must disprove it beyond a
reasonable doubt. The onus of proof remains on the Crown throughout. Other
commentators have made the same argument: Rupert Cross, The Golden Thread of
the English Criminal Law (1976), at pp. 11‑13; Mahoney, ""The
Presumption of Innocence"", supra, at pp. 18‑21; Stuart, Canadian
Criminal Law, supra, at pp. 39‑45.

 

36.                     This
Court has long recognized that there is a distinction between the degree of
evidence necessary to put an issue into play, requiring the trier of fact to
consider it, and the degree necessary to convince beyond a reasonable doubt. In
Latour v. The King, [1951] S.C.R. 19, Justice Fauteux for the Court
distinguished between the requirement of establishing a case and of introducing
evidence. He pointed out that the onus is on the Crown throughout to establish
the case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, while the accused need
do no more than raise a doubt. Fauteux J. noted that the accused is never
required to establish a defence, but need only show that the evidence,
including Crown evidence, indicates a defence may be available. The jury is
then required to acquit if it finds affirmatively that the defence existed or
if it is left in doubt on the point.

 

37.                     Sunbeam
Corporation (Canada) Ltd., supra, provides another illustration of
the principle. The Court was faced with the question whether the sufficiency of
evidence could be a question of law; Justice Ritchie for the majority held that
it could not. He recognized that the accused was never required to give evidence
(at p. 228):

 

I do not think that any authority is needed for the proposition that,
when the Crown has proved a prima facie case and no evidence is given on
behalf of the accused, the jury may convict, but I know of no authority
to the effect that the trier of fact is required to convict under such
circumstances. [Emphasis in original.]

 

The Crown is always required
to persuade the trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt, and the accused can
rely on the Crown's own evidence to put a defence in play. This principle was
reaffirmed by Justice Pigeon for the majority in R. v. Proudlock, [1979]
1 S.C.R. 525, where he held that the phrase ""in the absence of any
evidence to the contrary"" meant that the accused need only raise a
reasonable doubt. Pigeon J. commented that in some cases the accused could do
this by reference to the Crown's evidence while in other cases the accused
would have to adduce evidence or run the risk of conviction.

 

38.                     Judges
and academics have used a variety of terms to try to capture the distinction
between the two types of burdens. The burden of establishing a case has been
referred to as the ""major burden,"" the ""primary burden,""
the ""legal burden"" and the ""persuasive burden."" The burden
of putting an issue in play has been called the ""minor burden,"" the
""secondary burden,"" the ""evidential burden,"" the
""burden of going forward,"" and the ""burden of adducing
evidence."" While any combination of phrases has its advantages and
drawbacks, I prefer to use the terms ""persuasive burden"" to refer to
the requirement of proving a case or disproving defences, and ""evidential
burden"" to mean the requirement of putting an issue into play by reference
to evidence before the court. The party who has the persuasive burden is required
to persuade the trier of fact, to convince the trier of fact that a certain set
of facts existed. Failure to persuade means that the party loses. The party
with an evidential burden is not required to convince the trier of fact of
anything, only to point out evidence which suggests that certain facts existed.
The phrase ""onus of proof"" should be restricted to the persuasive
burden, since an issue can be put into play without being proven. The phrases
""burden of going forward"" and ""burden of adducing evidence""
should not be used, as they imply that the party is required to produce his or
her own evidence on an issue. As we have seen, in a criminal case the accused
can rely on evidence produced by the Crown to argue for a reasonable doubt.

 

39.                     It
is important not to identify the evidential burden solely with the accused. The
Crown has the evidential burden of leading evidence which, if believed, would
prove each element of the offence charged. If the Crown does not even meet this
evidential requirement, the case never goes to the trier of fact; the accused
has a right to a directed verdict of acquittal.

 

40.                     In
Oakes, supra, the Court examined and rejected the idea that the
presumption of innocence guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter  is
subject to statutory exceptions. To read the phrase ""according to
law"" in s. 11 (d) as permitting Parliament to alter the normal rule
whenever it chose to do so by statute would be completely contrary to the
concept of an entrenched constitutional right. Oakes, Vaillancourt
and Whyte held that statutory persuasive burdens on the accused infringe
the presumption of innocence. The common law is likewise required to conform to
s. 11 (d). A requirement that the accused bear a persuasive burden,
whether in a statute or at common law, will infringe s. 11 (d).

 

41.                     The
Edwards case, supra, makes clear that the common law of England
does in some cases place a persuasive burden of proof on the accused, but that
case was decided in a system where both Parliament and the courts can make
inroads on the presumption of innocence. It is of limited aid in interpreting
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . This Court has already
rejected English authority that the presumption of innocence is subject to
statutory exceptions; it is also necessary to reject English authority that the
presumption of innocence is subject to common law exceptions.

 

42.                     Having
said that, I would not wish to be understood to say that the Crown must lead
evidence to anticipate each and every possible defence. One of the underlying
ideas of the common law principle set out in Edwards is that it is not
possible for the Crown to know in advance what defence the accused will raise.
It is up to the accused to point out evidence, in either the Crown's case or in
the defence evidence, if any, that will support a defence. Once the accused
raises a defence the Crown must disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

43.                     The
decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Lee's Poultry Ltd., supra,
must now be read in the light of this Court's decisions in Oakes, Vaillancourt,
and Whyte. In that case, a provincial statute required the accused to
prove that it held the necessary permit. Brooke J.A. for the Ontario Court of
Appeal followed Edwards and held that in some circumstances a statutory
or common law reversal of the onus of proof will not violate s. 11 (d).
Brooke J.A. also relied on Martin J.A.'s decision in R. v. Oakes. He
held that the provision in question did not create a presumption, but simply
expressed in statutory form a well‑ recognized exception to general rules
of pleading and proof. He was also influenced by the ease with which an accused
could prove a licence existed and by the fact that it was rationally open to
the accused to prove the existence of the licence. He therefore held that the
provision did not breach s. 11 (d).

 

44.                     It
is necessary, however, to distinguish the analysis under s. 11 (d) from
that under s. 1 . What is important under s. 11 (d) is whether or not a
provision requires the accused to prove some fact, with a possibility of a
conviction in spite of a reasonable doubt. Factors such as ease of proof and a
rational connection go to the justification for an infringement and should be
considered in the s. 1  analysis. Lee's Poultry Ltd. is therefore of
little assistance on the meaning of s. 11 (d).

 

45.                     To
sum up, the Charter 's guarantee of the presumption of innocence places
the onus on the Crown throughout a case to prove guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt. Section 11 (d) is not qualified by exceptions, whether statutory
or at common law, that place the onus of proof on the accused. While the Crown
need not initially disprove every possible defence or exception, it does not
necessarily follow that the accused must prove a defence. In some instances,
the accused must point out some evidential basis to raise a defence which the
Crown must then disprove beyond a reasonable doubt, but any provision which
places a persuasive burden on the accused, with the possibility of a conviction
despite a reasonable doubt, will infringe s. 11 (d). Section 106.7(1)  is
such a provision.

 

                          VII

 

Constitutional Issues:
Section 1 

 

46.                     The
respondent and the Attorney General of Canada submit in the alternative that s.
106.7(1) is demonstrably justified under s. 1  as a reasonable limit in a free
and democratic society. To decide this point, it is necessary to refer to the
principles of s. 1  analysis set out in this Court's decision in Oakes, supra.
Two criteria must be met. First, the objective must be ""of sufficient
importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right or
freedom."" Second, the limit must be reasonable and demonstrably justified,
which requires it to pass ""a form of proportionality test"" (R. v.
Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 352). This second
criterion has three components. The measures must be carefully tailored and
rationally connected to the objective. They must impair the right in question
as little as possible. Finally, there must be proportionality between the
effects of the measure and the objective of the legislation (Oakes, supra,
at p. 139).

 

47.                     Part
II.1 of the Code, which contains s. 106.7(1), represents the latest
attempt by Parliament to strike the proper balance between the interest of
Canadian society in protecting its members from violent actions and the freedom
of individuals to possess and use guns for legitimate purposes. It embodies
wholly legitimate societal concerns for stricter regulation and control of guns
and other offensive weapons. The Crown and Attorney General of Canada argue
that s. 106.7(1) must be considered in the context of the statutory scheme
respecting restricted weapons.

 

48.                     The
policy of Part II.1 is to limit the ownership of dangerous weapons to those
people who will use them in an honest, responsible fashion. Some types of
weapons are prohibited altogether. The availability of other types of weapons,
notably handguns, is restricted, while long‑guns are subject to less
strict control. To acquire any type of permitted firearm, a firearms
acquisition certificate is required (s. 95(3)). An application for a firearms
acquisition certificate will be rejected if the firearms officer has
""notice of any matter that may render it desirable in the interest of the
safety of the applicant or any other person that the applicant should not
acquire a firearm"" (s. 104(1)). To possess a restricted weapon, a
registration certificate is required in addition to the firearms acquisition
certificate. Registration certificates can only be issued to applicants over
eighteen who need the restricted weapon to protect life, for use in their
occupation, for use in target practice, or for part of a gun collection (s.
106.1(3)). A person who wishes to possess a restricted weapon must apply to the
local registrar of firearms for a registration certificate (s. 106.1(1)). The
local registrar must examine the weapon and check that the person is eligible
for a registration certificate. If the person is eligible, the local registrar
forwards the application to the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police (s. 106.1(3)). If the local registrar has notice of any matter
suggesting that in the interests of safety it would not be advisable for the
applicant to have a restricted weapon, the local registrar must inform the
Commissioner (s. 106.1(6)). Upon receipt of the application from the local
registrar, the Commissioner issues the registration certificate (s. 106.1(7)),
unless the Commissioner has notice of any matter suggesting that in the
interests of safety it is not desirable that the applicant have a restricted
weapon (s. 106.4(3)). The registration certificate only entitles the owner to
keep the weapon at his or her residence or place of business (s. 106.1(8)). A
carrying permit is required to take the weapon off the premises mentioned in
the certificate (ss. 89(2), 106.2(1)).

 

49.                     Part
II.1 creates a number of offences with respect to the acquisition, possession
and use of firearms. Section 83(1) provides that the use of a firearm during
the commission of an indictable offence is itself an indictable offence.
Section 84 prohibits the careless use of a firearm. Section 88(1) provides that
every one who has a prohibited weapon in his or her possession commits an
indictable offence. Section 89(1) , under which the appellant was charged,
prohibits the possession of an unregistered restricted weapon. There are
numerous other offences relating to the sale, delivery or acquisition of
firearms and other offensive weapons (ss. 91‑97).

 

50.                     Part
II.1 thus expresses a clear legislative intention to prohibit the acquisition,
possession and use of all restricted weapons except under the authority of a
firearms acquisition certificate and a registration certificate, or under
statutory exemptions such as those mentioned in s. 90 with respect to peace
officers and police officers. The Code thus contains, as noted in McGuigan
v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 284, ""a comprehensive `gun control'
legislative scheme intended to discourage the use of firearms by the criminal
element of our society"". That the objective behind Part II.1 in general
and s. 106.7(1) in particular ""relate[s] to concerns which are pressing
and substantial in a free and democratic society"" is self‑evident.
The provisions satisfy the first stage of the approach to s. 1  set out in Oakes.

 

51.                     It
may be wondered whether the specific objective of s. 106.7(1) is simply one of
administrative convenience, which is rarely if ever an objective of sufficient
importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right. If so,
that alone may be enough to decide the s. 1  analysis. Without deciding this point,
I prefer to go on to the proportionality analysis, for two reasons. First, the
objective of the section must be evaluated in the context of Part II.1, where
it is located, and its place in the system of firearm regulation taken into
account. Second, for reasons which I hope to make clear later on, the
constitutionality of the application of s. 106.7(1) must be considered in
relation to the particular offence in question. Because of the variety of
offences created in Part II.1 the role played by s. 106.7(1) will vary with the
offence. This in turn will affect the factors to be considered in deciding
whether the application of the section can be upheld under s. 1 . The
determining factor may in some cases be found in the interplay between s.
106.7(1) and the offence provision. Consideration of the objective alone does
not appear to take this interplay into account; the proportionality analysis is
necessary to do so.

 

52.                     The
next part of the Oakes inquiry is the proportionality between the
provision and the infringement. In evaluating the proportionality of s.
106.7(1), it is important to remember how restrictive is the overall system of
registering restricted weapons. There is one person in all of Canada who can
issue registration certificates, and that is the Commissioner of the R.C.M.P.
(s. 106.1(7)). The Commissioner is required by statute to keep a registry of
all registration certificates issued (s. 106.6(1)(a), and that
centralized computer registry, the Canadian Police Information Centre Telex, is
available for any police force to consult (Martin L. Friedland, ""Gun
Control in Canada: Politics and Impact,"" in A Century of Criminal
Justice (1984), at pp. 120‑21; Evaluation of the Canadian Gun
Control Legislation, First Progress Report (1981), at pp. 83 and 91
(hereinafter First Progress Report)). Although the certificates are
issued by the Commissioner, all of the preliminary screening is done by the
local registrar of firearms, who investigates applicants to be certain they
meet the requirements for possession of a restricted weapon and do not pose any
threat to safety (Friedland, at pp. 120‑21; First Progress Report,
at pp. 91‑93; Hawley, Canadian Firearms Law (1988), at pp. 23‑37).
The local registrar is almost always a member of the local police force with
jurisdiction over the certain area, or occasionally a civilian employed by the
police (First Progress Report, at pp. 76‑77). Finally, a person
can possess a restricted weapon at only one of two places: the person's
residence, or his or her ordinary place of business (s. 106.1(8)). The local
registrar has no authority to issue a registration certificate authorizing the
owner to keep the weapon at any other place (R. v. Wilson (1984), 17
C.C.C. (3d) 126 (Alta. Q.B.)) It is an offence for the owner to keep the weapon
at any place other than that listed on the registration certificate, or even to
take it off the listed premises without a carrying permit (s. 89(2)).

 

53.                     The
combination of the strict limits contained in the registration certificate and
the local administration of the application system means that it ""should
not be at all difficult"" for the Crown to prove that the accused does not
have a registration certificate for the weapon. In any area, there will be one
local registrar who has jurisdiction over the location of the accused's
residence and normal place of business. (In some cases where an accused lives
within one police jurisdiction and works in another, there will be two local
registrars who could process the application.) If that local registrar has not
received an application for a registration certificate, then no one else could
have received one.

 

54.                     The
first stage of the proportionality inquiry is whether there is a rational
connection between the provision and the objective. In this case, the Attorney
General of Canada argued strongly that there was a rational connection between
the objective of the legislation and s. 106.7(1). In Oakes, this Court
held that in the case of a statute which reversed the onus of proof, in order
to satisfy this branch of s. 1  analysis, there must be a rational connection
between the basic or proved fact and the presumed fact. Here, the proved fact,
possession of a restricted weapon, in no way tends rationally to prove the
presumed fact, that the accused does not have a registration certificate.

 

55.                     Even
if a less stringent rational connection should be applied to offences
prohibiting certain acts in the absence of a permit or licence, in my view the
present appeal is governed by the principles set out in R. v. Holmes, supra.
As in that case, I do not think that the provision here challenged impairs
""as little as possible"" the presumption of innocence (R. v. Big M.
Drug Mart Ltd., supra, at p. 352, Oakes, supra, at p.
139). Presumably, the objective behind Part II.1 does not include convicting
persons who are able to raise a reasonable doubt as to their guilt but are
unable to establish their innocence on a balance of probabilities. The
legislative objective behind Part II.1 can just as easily be met, in the
absence of s. 106.7(1), by not requiring an accused to prove on a balance of
probabilities that the firearm is or was duly registered. The most that should
be necessary is that the accused be required to point to evidence suggesting
that the weapon is or was registered. Since the fact of non‑registration
must be proven for a conviction under s. 89(1) , the Crown must be able to
provide the trier of fact with sufficient evidence, be it oral or documentary,
to justify concluding beyond a reasonable doubt that the firearm in fact is not
or was not registered.

 

56.                     The
Attorney General of Canada argued that even if s. 106.7(1) places the onus of
proof on the accused contrary to s. 11 (d), the weight of that burden is
greatly reduced by the addition of s. 106.7(2), which I set out again for ease
of reference:

 

        106.7 ...

 

        (2) In any proceedings under any of sections 83 to 106.5,
a document purporting to be a firearms acquisition certificate, registration
certificate or permit is evidence of the statements contained therein.

 

The Attorney General of
Canada argues that this provision, when coupled with s. 24(1) of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I‑23, provides a means for the accused to meet
the burden of proof set out by s. 106.7(1) without any danger of self‑crimination.

 

57.                     One
objection to reverse onus clauses is that they may force the accused into the
witness box, sacrificing the right to remain silent to the requirement that he
or she prove a fact on a balance of probabilities or risk conviction. The close
links between the two rights were recognized before and after the enactment of
the Charter , which now guarantees them both in s. 11 (c) and (d).
(See R. v. Proudlock, supra, at pp. 550‑51; Dubois v.
The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 350, at pp. 356‑58; Ratushny, ""The
Role of the Accused in the Criminal Process"", in Beaudoin and Tarnopolsky,
eds., The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms : Commentary, at pp.
358‑59). Even if the reverse onus clause only relates to one issue, as is
the case with s. 106.7(1) , an accused who testifies to meet the onus on that
point is open to cross‑examination on the entire case. Had Parliament
provided a way for the accused to enter evidence of the certificate without
being required to testify, the arguments of the Attorney General of Canada
would be more compelling. I am not, however, satisfied that Parliament has done
so in s. 106.7(2) .

 

58.                     My
reason for concluding that Parliament has not so provided is based on the
common law relating to the admission of documents into evidence and the
interpretation of s. 106.7(2). Before any document can be admitted into
evidence there are two obstacles it must pass. First, it must be authenticated
in some way by the party who wishes to rely on it. This authentication requires
testimony by some witness; a document cannot simply be placed on the bench in
front of the judge. Second, if the document is to be admitted as evidence of
the truth of the statements it contains, it must be shown to fall within one of
the exceptions to the hearsay rule (Delisle, Evidence: Principles and
Problems, at pp. 103‑105; Ewart, Documentary Evidence in Canada,
at pp. 12, 13, 33; Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 7, 3rd ed., paras. 2128‑2135).
These are two distinct issues and in my opinion s. 106.7(2) only addresses the
latter. A registration certificate, once admitted, is evidence of the
statements it contains, namely that the person it names had complied with the
registration requirements for a restricted weapon. How does the document get
admitted into evidence?

 

59.                     One
of the hallmarks of the common law of evidence is that it relies on witnesses
as the means by which evidence is produced in court. As a general rule, nothing
can be admitted as evidence before the court unless it is vouched for viva
voce by a witness. Even real evidence, which exists independently of any
statement by any witness, cannot be considered by the court unless a witness
identifies it and establishes its connection to the events under consideration.
Unlike other legal systems, the common law does not usually provide for self‑authenticating
documentary evidence.

 

60.                     Parliament
has provided several statutory exceptions to the hearsay rule for documents,
but it less frequently makes exception to the requirement that a witness vouch
for a document. For example, the Canada Evidence Act  provides for the
admission of financial and business records as evidence of the statements they
contain, but it is still necessary for a witness to explain to the court how the
records were made before the court can conclude that the documents can be
admitted under the statutory provisions (see ss. 29(2)  and 30(6) ). Those
explanations can be made by the witness by affidavit, but it is still necessary
to have a witness. Exceptionally, s. 241 of the Criminal Code  allows for
certificates of analysis for breath and blood samples to be evidence of the
facts alleged in them without proof of the authenticity of the document (s.
241(1) (e) to (i)), but the prosecution must give notice of the
intention to use the certificates and the accused can require that the analyst
attend at trial for cross‑examination (s. 241(6)  and (7) ). There are also
common law exceptions to this principle, but the certificate now in issue does
not fall within them.

 

61.                     In
light of the common law of evidence relating to documents, I do not think that
s. 106.7(2) can be interpreted as anything more than a provision which allows a
certificate to be evidence of the truth of the statements it contains, as an
exception to the hearsay rule. It does not mean that a registration certificate
is a self‑authenticating document that can be received as evidence
without a witness. The use of the word ""purporting"" may indicate that
if the certificate is admitted and the Crown wishes to challenge its
authenticity it must do so by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but the word
""purporting"" by itself is not enough to make the document self‑authenticating,
contrary to the general common law approach to documentary evidence. Section
106.7(2) does not make it possible for the accused to put the certificate
before the court without some witness identifying it.

 

62.                     There
will always be one other person who can testify whether the accused had a
registration certificate, and that is the local registrar of firearms who
processed the application. The accused could avoid testifying by calling this
person instead. As soon as this suggestion is made, it undermines the argument
that it is more difficult for the Crown to lead evidence on the question of a
registration certificate than it would be for the accused: the local registrar
of firearms will likely be a police officer, probably a member of the same
force that laid the charges.

 

63.                     Section
106.7(1) will either force the accused to testify, in effect requiring him or
her to choose between the constitutionally guaranteed rights not to testify or
to be presumed innocent, or will require the accused to call a police officer
as a defence witness to testify about information contained in police files. In
either case, it cannot be said that Parliament has impaired the presumption of
innocence as little as possible.

 

64.                     It
is true of course that it would be very easy for the accused in this case to
testify whether or not he had a registration certificate, but in almost every
case, the accused is one of the people best able to explain what happened. Yet
it is a fundamental value in our society that we not force the accused to
testify, even when the accused is the only person who can answer the question.
When there are other witnesses available, as in the present situation, there is
even less reason to expect the accused to explain events.

 

65.                     What
is the consequence of a conclusion that s. 106.7(1) cannot be salvaged by s. 1 
and that the Crown must disprove the existence of a registration certificate
when that is in issue? The very comprehensiveness of the gun control scheme of
Part II.1 suggests that the prosecution will be able to meet this requirement.
A registration certificate for a restricted weapon is issued for a limited
territory only. It will be a relatively easy matter for the Crown to determine
if the person has a registration certificate, by enquiring with the local
registrar for the area where the accused lives or has a place of business. The
local registrar, almost always a police officer or employee of the police, will
be able to say whether any application from the accused has ever been received;
if not, it is reasonable to conclude the accused did not have a registration
certificate, as no other official could have processed the application. As a
back‑up, there is also the central registry which the Commissioner is
required by statute to maintain of all registration certificates issued,
revoked, or refused (s. 106.6). This information is entered on the Canadian
Police Information Centre Telex, a centralised computer data bank for the
entire country. While it may be the case under some regulatory schemes that it
is very difficult for the prosecution to find out whether or not an accused has
a required permit or licence, that is not the case here. The police have access
to the information, since they are almost invariably the persons responsible
for the administration of the Part II.1 registry system, and in any event can
consult the computer registry.

 

66.                     It
is not unreasonable to require the Crown to consult information within the
knowledge of the police and to be ready if necessary to produce that
information in court. If the argument of convenience to the accused is to be
available at all to justify the reversal of the onus of proof under s. 1 , it
can only be where it is very difficult for the Crown to meet that onus. If it
is possible as a general matter for the Crown to meet the onus, then it should
be required to do so, even if it would be easier for the accused to prove the
matter. When the police actually have the records in question, or access to
them, it is hard to argue that it is difficult for them to prove the absence of
the necessary certificate. It is worth noting as well, that the Canada Evidence
Act , s. 26(2) , explicitly provides for proof by affidavit of an officer
having charge of such records that a search has been made and that the officer
has been unable to find the appropriate licence or document has been issued.

 

67.                     That
this is not an impossible task is illustrated by the facts of this case: Allen
Prov. Ct. J. convicted the appellant at trial without using s. 106.7(1). The
Crown led enough evidence at trial to persuade Allen Prov. Ct. J. beyond a
reasonable doubt that the appellant did not have a registration certificate. It
is true that Barkman Co. Ct. J. took a different view of the evidence, but that
does not mean the Crown will never be able to prove its case. The Crown could
have called Sgt. Pilcher's successor to establish that no certificate was
issued after 1979. It could have applied under s. 30  of the Canada Evidence
Act  to enter the contents of the file as evidence. In this case, the Crown
simply failed to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

68.                     I
would conclude that the application of s. 106.7(1) to a person charged with an
offence under s. 89(1)  is constitutionally invalid. This does not mean,
however, that s. 106.7(1) is completely invalid. The section 1  analysis in this
case has depended heavily on the nature of registration certificates, including
the strict limitations on the area of possession of the restricted weapon and
the highly localised administration of the registry system. The section 1 
analysis of the presumption in connection with other Part II.1 offences,
concerning different certificates or permits, may have a different outcome. For
example, firearms acquisition certificates are valid throughout Canada (s.
104(12)). Carrying permits and transport permits allow the owner of a
restricted weapon to possess it in different areas, possibly crossing from one
police jurisdiction to another (s. 106.2(10)). The justification for s.
106.7(1) in connection with these documents will likely involve different issues
and a different s. 1  analysis. Since this case does not involve these types of
permits or certificates, I would limit the holding in this case to the
conclusion that the application of s. 106.7(1) to a person charged with an
offence under s. 89(1)  cannot be justified under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

69.                     There
is a final point. Parliament has provided in other cases for proof by way of
documentary evidence, without the necessity for a witness in court. The
certificate of a breathalyzer analyst, referred to earlier, is one such
example. The Canada Evidence Act  provides another way to prove matters
by document. There does not seem to be any difficulty for Parliament to allow
similar proof of the files of the local registrar, or possibly of the contents
of the Commissioner's central registry.

 

                          VIII

 

Conclusion

 

70.                     In
sum, it is my opinion that s. 106.7(1)  of the Criminal Code  violates s.
11 (d) of the Charter . The application of s. 106.7(1)  to a person
charged under s. 89(1)  cannot be justified under s. 1 . I would therefore answer
the constitutional question in the affirmative.

 

71.                     I
would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal of
Manitoba and restore the verdict of acquittal on each of the two charges.

 

           The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

72.                     Beetz J.‑‑Given
the dates of the pre‑Charter  trial and the post‑Charter 
summary conviction appeal, I assume without deciding that the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  applies to this case, and I agree with
Justice McIntyre.

 

        The judgment of
McIntyre, La Forest and L'Heureux‑Dubé was delivered by

 

 

73.                     McIntyre J.‑‑I
have read the reasons of the Chief Justice which have been prepared for
delivery in this appeal. With deference, I am unable to agree with the result
he has reached and with the reasons which have led to his conclusion. I will accordingly
express my views on this appeal. The Chief Justice has set out the facts,
outlined the dispositions made in the courts below and the essence of the
reasons given by the judges in those courts.

 

74.                     The
issues raised in the appeal were stated by the appellant in these terms. He
submitted that the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in deciding the appeal
on a question of fact, or in the alternative, on a question of mixed law and
fact; also, that the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in deciding that s.
106.7(1)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada is constitutionally valid and
does not contravene the provisions of s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms . As to the first ground, I agree with the
Chief Justice that a question of law was raised in this appeal before the Court
of Appeal. It involved a question of the admissibility of evidence which, as
the Chief Justice said, is a clear question of law.

 

75.                     I
would agree with the Chief Justice that in order to set aside an acquittal, in
this case that recorded by Barkman Co. Ct. J. on the first appeal [(1983), 22
Man. R. (2d) 46] the Crown must satisfy the Court that the result would not
necessarily have been the same if the error made at trial had not occurred. I
do not accept, however, considering the evidence adduced and the nature of the
evidence excluded, that the Crown failed to meet that test. This disagreement
does not assume great significance here, however, because it is evident from
the reasons of Barkman Co. Ct. J. that his acquittal of the appellant depended
upon his finding that s. 106.7(1)  of the Criminal Code  offended s. 11 (d)
of the Charter . After stating that the evidence called by the Crown (the
appellant gave no evidence) was insufficient to establish guilt, he said:

 

        I am therefore of the opinion that the accused should not have
been convicted unless the provisions of s. 106.7(1)  are applicable.

 

Then, after considering the
section and the provisions of s. 11 (d) of the Charter , he
concluded by saying:

 

        I therefore find the learned provincial court judge erred in
admitting hearsay evidence and I find that s. 106.7(1)  does not apply because
it offends s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

He had already found that the
appellant had possession of the weapons and his acquittal then depended on his
finding that s. 106.7(1)  was unconstitutional. In other words, he rejected the
section on the basis that it reversed the onus of proof. The issue of the
constitutionality of the section is therefore vital to a decision in this case.

 

76.                     I
turn to the constitutional point. Section 89(1)  and s. 106.7  of the Criminal
Code , the sections with which we are primarily concerned in this appeal,
form part of Part II.1 of the Code which deals with firearms and other
offensive weapons. The Code has included provisions for the control, use
and possession of firearms since the enactment of the 1892 Criminal Code,
S.C. 1892, c. 29, s. 105. That section prohibited the possession of pistols and
air guns at other than specific places and, as well, provided for exemptions
from the operation of the section. Since that time, there have been successive
amendments which without exception have strengthened the controls upon
possession and use of firearms. The history of this process is summarized by
Martin L. Friedland, A Century of Criminal Justice (1984), commencing at
p. 125. He concludes, at p. 128, with what may be considered a sober warning:

 

        Canada has been fortunate in having had a gradual development
of control over firearms for the past 100 years. We have never had to face a
situation as in the United States today, which appears to many observers to be
almost out of control.

 

This is a consideration which
may well be significant in any judicial approach to the construction of Part
II.1 of the Code. It is evident that the strict control of handguns has
been and remains an essential feature of the Canadian gun control laws.

 

77.                     It
is clear that the overall intent of Parliament in enacting Part II.1 of the
Criminal Code  was to prohibit the acquisition and use of weapons save in
accordance with the strict controls it prescribed. Section 89(1)  under which
the appellant was charged gives effect to this intention by providing that:

 

        89. (1) Every one who has in his possession a restricted weapon
for which he does not have a registration certificate

 

(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for five years; or

 

(b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary
conviction.

 

 

 

It is evident then that only
one possessing a restricted weapon for which he has no registration certificate
can be convicted under the section. If a certificate of registration is not
obtained, a criminal offence arises from the mere possession of the restricted
firearm. Section 89(1)  does not apply to anyone who has a valid certificate
which is a condition precedent to the lawful possession of the weapons.

 

78.                     The
argument is made that s. 106.7(1)  imposes a reverse onus of proof upon the
accused in a prosecution under s. 89(1) . Section 106.7(1)  reads:

 

        106.7 (1) Where, in any proceedings under any of sections 83 to
106.5, any question arises as to whether a person is or was the holder of a
firearms acquisition certificate, registration certificate or permit, the onus
is on the accused to prove that that person is or was the holder of such
firearms acquisition certificate, registration certificate or permit.

 

79.                     In
pre‑Charter  cases the imposition of a reverse onus upon an accused
was frequently recognized and accepted as an exception to the general rule
requiring proof by the Crown of all elements of an offence beyond a reasonable
doubt. It was settled, as well, that where the accused was required to
discharge an onus relating to an element of a criminal offence, he had to do so
according to the civil standard of proof, that is, he had to establish the
matter on a balance of probabilities. A statement of the rule, as then
accepted, is to be found in R. v. Appleby, [1972] S.C.R. 303. It must be
recognized now, however, that a statutory provision which imposes a burden of
proof or disproof of an element of an offence on an accused creates an
impermissible reverse onus under the Charter : see R. v. Vaillancourt,
[1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, at p. 655;  R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103; and R.
v. Whyte, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 3. It has been held that any statutory provision
which could have the effect of permitting a conviction, notwithstanding the
existence of a reasonable doubt as to guilt, would contravene s. 11 (d)
of the Charter  which guarantees the right to be presumed innocent until
proven guilty according to law.

 

80.                     In
my view, however, these principles cannot be of assistance to the appellant
here. There is no reverse onus imposed upon the accused by s. 106.7(1) , despite
the words which are employed in the section. The holder of a registration
certificate cannot be made subject to a conviction under s. 89(1) . He is not
required to prove or disprove any element of the offence or for that matter
anything related to the offence. At most, he may be required to show by the
production of the certificate that s. 89(1)  does not apply to him and he is
exempt from its provisions. Far from reversing any onus, s. 106.7  provides in
subs. (2) that a document purporting to be a valid registration certificate is
evidence and, therefore, prima facie proof of the statements contained
therein and in the case at bar conclusive proof, as provided in s. 24(1) of the
Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I‑23, set out hereunder:

 

        24. (1) Where an enactment provides that a document is evidence
of a fact without anything in the context to indicate that the document is
conclusive evidence, then, in any judicial proceedings, the document is
admissible in evidence and the fact shall be deemed to be established in the
absence of any evidence to the contrary.

 

As Hart J.A. stated in R.
v. Conrad (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 482 (N.S.C.A.), at p. 487, dealing with a
charge under s. 87  of the Criminal Code :

 

The crime is to carry a weapon concealed, and all persons who do so are
guilty of the offence. Certain persons are, however, exempted from this
prohibition provided they establish their right to exemption before the court.
The requirement that they affirmatively establish their privilege of possessing
and carrying a restricted weapon does not, in my opinion, interfere with or
impede their right to be presumed innocent. The existence of their privilege is
not a fact which must be negatived [sic] by the Crown beyond a
reasonable doubt in proving the offence charged. No presumption of guilt arises
from the combination of ss. 87  and 106.7(1)  of the Criminal Code . This
is not a situation where a person is deemed to be guilty of an offence unless
he establishes his innocence. He is in fact deemed to be not guilty of an
offence under s. 87  if he holds a permit of exemption, but the burden is cast
upon him to establish that he falls within the exemption given to him.
[Emphasis added.]

 

Although the accused must
establish that he falls within the exemption, there is no danger that he could
be convicted under s. 89(1) , despite the existence of a reasonable doubt as to
guilt, because the production of the certificate resolves all doubts in favour
of the accused and in the absence of the certificate no defence is possible
once possession has been shown. In such a case, where the only relevant
evidence is the certificate itself, it cannot be said that the accused could
adduce evidence sufficient to raise doubt without at the same time establishing
conclusively that the certificate had been issued. The theory behind any
licensing system is that when an issue arises as to the possession of the
licence, it is the accused who is in the best position to resolve the issue.
Otherwise, the issuance of the certificate or licence would serve no useful
purpose. Not only is it rationally open to the accused to prove he holds a
licence (see R. v. Shelley, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 196, at p. 200, per
Laskin C.J.), it is the expectation inherent in the system.

 

81.                     Therefore,
in my view, s. 106.7(1)  does not violate s. 11 (d) of the Charter .
On that basis, I would dismiss the appeal and uphold the conviction.

 

Section 1  Analysis

 

82.                     In
view of the conclusion that I have reached on the constitutional question, it
is not necessary for me to consider the application of s. 1  of the Charter .
However, since the question has been raised and argued, I will deal with s. 1 
for the purposes of this discussion on the assumption that s. 106.7(1)  does
infringe the s. 11 (d) right. In my view, s. 106.7(1)  is clearly
sustainable as a reasonable limit prescribed by law which can be demonstrably
justified in a free and democratic society. The Chief Justice by reference to R.
v. Oakes, supra, has set out the general approach to s. 1  which that case
dictates. On the basis of the Oakes test, the impugned section is
clearly sustainable. The purpose of Part II.1 and its component sections,
including s. 89(1) , most assuredly aims at an objective ""of sufficient
importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right or
freedom"" (see Oakes, p. 138). The private possession of weapons and
their frequent misuse has become a grave problem for the law enforcement
authorities and a growing threat to the community. The rational control of the
possession and use of firearms for the general social benefit is too important
an objective to require a defence. Therefore, I agree with the Chief Justice in
his conclusion that the provisions of Part II.1, in general, and s. 106.7(1) ,
in particular, satisfy the first test, that is, that they serve an important
social objective.

 

83.                     The
second test in Oakes involves a consideration of proportionality. In my
view, s. 106.7(1)  meets that test as well. This Court has repeatedly observed
that the proportionality test must be flexible to avoid a rigid confinement of
the Court's consideration to fixed and unchanging standards. The Chief Justice
has said in Oakes, at p. 139:

 

Although the nature of the proportionality test will vary depending on
the circumstances, in each case courts will be required to balance the
interests of society with those of individuals and groups.

 

A certain element of common sense
must dictate: the Chief Justice observed in Oakes, at p. 138, that:

 

...there may be cases where certain elements of the s. 1  analysis are
obvious or self‑evident.

 

In R. v. Edwards Books and
Art Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 713, he stated at pp. 768‑69:

 

The Court stated that the nature of the proportionality test would vary
depending on the circumstances. Both in articulating the standard of proof and
in describing the criteria comprising the proportionality requirement the Court
has been careful to avoid rigid and inflexible standards.

 

Again, at pp. 781‑82:

 

A ""reasonable limit"" is one which, having regard to the
principles enunciated in Oakes, it was reasonable for the legislature to
impose. The courts are not called upon to substitute judicial opinions for
legislative ones as to the place at which to draw a precise line. [Emphasis
added.]

 

La Forest J. (concurring in
the result in Edwards Books, supra) made the following comment,
at pp. 794‑95:

 

        Let me first underline what is mentioned in the Chief Justice's
judgment, that in describing the criteria comprising the proportionality
requirement, the Court has been careful to avoid rigid and inflexible
standards. That seems to me to be essential. Given that the objective is of
pressing and substantial concern, the Legislature must be allowed adequate
scope to achieve that objective. It must be remembered that the business of
government is a practical one. The Constitution must be applied on a realistic
basis having regard to the nature of the particular area sought to be regulated
and not on an abstract theoretical plane . . . .

 

        By the foregoing, I do not mean to suggest that this Court
should, as a general rule, defer to legislative judgments when those judgments
trench upon rights considered fundamental in a free and democratic society.
Quite the contrary, I would have thought the Charter  established the
opposite regime. On the other hand, having accepted the importance of the
legislative objective, one must in the present context recognize that if the
legislative goal is to be achieved, it will inevitably be achieved to the
detriment of some. Moreover, attempts to protect the rights of one group will
also inevitably impose burdens on the rights of other groups. There is no
perfect scenario in which the rights of all can be equally protected.

 

        In seeking to achieve a goal that is demonstrably justified in
a free and democratic society, therefore, a legislature must be given
reasonable room to manoeuvre to meet these conflicting pressures. Of course,
what is reasonable will vary with the context. Regard must be had to the nature
of the interest infringed and to the legislative scheme sought to be
implemented.

 

And, in R. v. Morgentaler,
[1988] 1 S.C.R. 30, the Chief Justice said, at pp. 73‑74:

 

In Oakes, at p. 139, the Court referred to three considerations
which are typically useful in assessing the proportionality of means to ends.
First, the means chosen to achieve an important objective should be rational,
fair and not arbitrary. Second, the legislative means should impair as little
as possible the right or freedom under consideration. Third, the effects of the
limitation upon the relevant right or freedom should not be out of proportion
to the objective sought to be achieved.

 

84.                     In
my view, the proportionality test in Oakes is easily satisfied in this
case. Before going further, it will be helpful to state in simple terms just
what is required of persons who wish to possess and use restricted weapons.
They are required to register the weapons. Having done so, they are provided
with a certificate which excludes them from the provisions of Part II.1 within
the terms of their certificate. If a question arises as to the existence of a permit
or certificate, they are required to produce it. That is the burden imposed
upon a person lawfully in possession of a restricted weapon. In this way, the
legislative purpose implicit in s. 89(1)  of the Criminal Code  is
recognized and given effect. A condition precedent to the lawful possession of
a restricted weapon is the obtaining of a valid registration certificate by the
possessor. If the certificate is not held, a criminal offence has been
committed by the mere fact of possession. Thus, a balance has been struck
between the interest of the community in the control of possession and use of
firearms and the interest of those who desire to possess and make lawful use of
firearms. Considering then the first branch of the proportionality test, it is
completely ""rational, fair and not arbitrary"" that where any question
arises as to whether the proper certificate has been issued the accused be
expected to produce it. This is particularly true where, as here, the impugned
legislative provisions provide to the lawful weapon holder an absolute defence
or immunity from prosecution. It is, in my view, irrelevant that possession of
a restricted weapon ""in no way tends rationally to prove"" any lack of
registration certificate, for the possession of the weapon in the absence of
the certificate is an offence complete in itself. In addition, as has been
pointed out earlier, there is no possibility that a person could be convicted
despite the existence of a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. This could not
occur. In my view, therefore, it is totally unreasonable to require the Crown
to prove the non‑occurrence of an event (registration) for which the Criminal
Code  itself provides the only relevant evidence directly to the affected
party. As Brooke J.A. said in R. v. Lee's Poultry Ltd. (1985), 17 C.C.C.
(3d) 539 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 544 regarding the comment by Dubin J.A. during the
argument on that case:

 

""How could it be unfair to ask a person to produce his licence or
evidence that he has one? Surely, it is the sensible thing to do"".

 

85.                     Secondly,
s. 106.7(1) should impair as little as possible the right to be presumed
innocent. The Chief Justice objects to an obligation on an accused to produce a
licence on the basis that it may force the accused into the witness box.
Reference was made to a passage from pp. 184‑85, Glanville Williams,
The Proof of Guilt (3rd ed. 1963), in support of the argument against
making exceptions to the principle that the Crown bear the onus of proof. The
words which follow the excerpt referred to by the Chief Justice, however, cast
light upon the question of requiring the accused to enter the witness box. The
learned author continued his discussion, at p. 185, with the following:

 

There is a clear if subtle difference between shifting the burden of
proof, or risk of non‑persuasion of the jury, and shifting the evidential
burden, or burden of introducing evidence in proof of one's case. It is not a
grave departure from traditional principles to shift the evidential burden,
though such a shifting does take away from the accused the right to make a
submission that there is no case to go to the jury on the issue in question,
and it may in effect force him to go into the witness‑box.

 

In any event, the risk of
cross‑examination upon going into the witness box would be relatively
small, given that the only relevant issue to which it would ordinarily be
addressed is as to whether a registration certificate had been properly
acquired and, in any event, under s. 13  of the Charter  and the judgments
of this Court in Dubois v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 350, and R. v.
Mannion, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 272, which applied its provisions, the cross‑examination
could not be used against the accused in any other case and an accused would be
exposed to no danger in that respect. Of more importance, however, is the fact
that the concern is more academic than real because the mere existence of a
valid certificate would ordinarily forestall any criminal proceedings. It
becomes improbable, to say the least, that an accused will ever be forced to
testify merely to produce his licence. In my view, the fact that an accused
might be required to enter the witness box to tender his certificate would not
be a matter of great significance and certainly not one which would justify a
finding of unconstitutionality of s. 106.7(1) . Therefore, in my view,
Parliament has impaired very minimally the presumption of innocence by
requiring an accused to show his licence as proof of lawful possession.

 

86.                     Finally,
there is no doubt that the third test of proportionality, as between the
limitation of the Charter  right and the objectives sought to be
achieved, is also amply demonstrated. It has been suggested that it
""should not be at all difficult"" for the Crown to prove a negative,
namely, that no certificate had been issued. This, however, is to deny the many
problems of proof which the licensing system was itself designed to avoid.
First is the problem of the number of registrars who could deal with the
application for registration. The local registrar can issue a certificate based
on the normal place of business even though the accused lives in another city
or province. If an accused carries on several businesses in diverse areas or resides
at varying locations, is it reasonable to expect that several local registrars
be called to testify that after a search of their records they could find no
certificate issued? I am unable to agree with the Chief Justice in his
conclusion that:

 

If that local registrar had not received an application for a
registration certificate, then no one else could have received one.

 

It is not necessarily an easy
matter for the Crown to prove non‑registration. The existence of a
central computerized registry system offers no complete answer to the problems
facing the Crown in meeting the burden the Chief Justice would impose. To
authenticate the accuracy of a computer file could involve extensive
evidentiary procedures and much would need to be proven in order to verify the
completeness of the computer record and the absence of a certificate for an
accused. This would be an inordinate burden on the Crown in criminal
enforcement when Parliament itself adopted the reasonable alternative of
providing the accused with a certificate which would establish his innocence by
its mere production.

 

87.                     The
measures adopted in Part II.1 of the Criminal Code  are carefully
tailored to effect a balance between the community interest and that of those
who desire to possess weapons lawfully and they are clearly appropriate to the
objectives sought. Only minimal interference is made with the right of the
individual weapon possessor. His rights from a practical point of view are
limited to the least extent possible. Even if there is merit in the suggestion
that the Crown, using computers and modern technology, could easily negate the
fact of the existence of a permit, Parliament has made a reasonable choice in
the matter and, in my view, it is not for the Court, in circumstances where the
impugned statutory provision clearly involves, at most, minimal ‑‑
or even trivial‑‑interference with the right guaranteed in the Charter ,
to postulate some alternative which in its view would offer a better solution
to the problem, for to do so is to enter the legislative field, so far at least
not entirely removed from Parliament. I would therefore hold that any limits
imposed by s. 106.7(1)  of the Criminal Code  are sustainable under s. 1 
of the Charter .

 

88.              A
constitutional question was posed in these terms:

 

Is section 106.7(1) of the Criminal Code  of Canada
constitutionally invalid in that it contravenes the provisions of s. 11 (d)
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

89.                     I
would answer the question in the negative, dismiss the appeal and restore the
conviction.

 

        The following are the
reasons delivered by

 

 

90.                     Lamer J.
(dissenting)‑‑I agree with the Chief Justice in all regards except
for the objective he assigns to s. 106.7(1) when under the s. 1  scrutiny he
takes the section through the Oakes test. While I certainly do agree
with him that ""to discourage the use of firearms by the criminal element
of our society"" is an objective which ""relate(s) to concerns which
are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society"", and that
such an objective ""satisfi[es] the first stage of the approach to s. 1  set
out in Oakes"", I am, with respect, of the view that is the object
the attainment of which is sought through making it an offence to possess
unregistered restricted weapons, under s. 89(1)  and the various other sections
restricting or prohibiting possession or use of different types of weapons.

 

91.                     Section
106.7(1) is not particular nor essential to weapons legislation. It is a purely
evidentiary section which could be appended or directed to any number of laws
requiring the licensing of persons or the registration of certain things, such
as in this case guns, but also automobiles under provincial legislation, dogs
under municipal by‑laws, to name but a few. The objective of a section
such as s. 106.7(1) is to relieve the prosecution of the inconvenience‑‑a
slight one in these days of computers and of instant communication facilities‑‑of
securing a certificate from the appropriate authority attesting to the absence
of any record establishing registration. It is in no way part of the arsenal in
the war against crime involving weapons. Its sole purpose is administrative
convenience. When the cost of this convenience is the restriction of an
accused's rights under s. 11 (d) in the context of the prosecution of a Criminal
Code  offence, it is clearly not an objective of sufficient importance to
warrant overriding such a right. This to me ends the s. 1  enquiry.

 

92.                     Before
concluding, I should add that this is not to say that, in a setting where
imprisonment is not available as a penalty and where conviction does not carry
the stigma of a criminal record, administrative convenience could not prevail
over the rights of the citizen. But this is not the case here.

 

93.                     Subject
to these remarks, I concur in the reasons of the Chief Justice and in his
disposition of this appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

 

                   Criminal
law ‑‑ Appeal ‑‑ Powers of the Court of Appeal ‑‑
Defence of insanity raised at trial ‑‑ Jury's verdict of guilty ‑‑
Court of Appeal refusing to interfere with jury's verdict because there was
evidence to support it ‑‑ Whether Court of Appeal had a duty under
s. 613(1)(d) of the Criminal Code to review the evidence and to arrive at its
own conclusion on the issue of insanity ‑‑ Whether verdict
unreasonable ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, s.
613(1)(a), (d).

 

                   At
the accused's trial on two counts of second degree murder the principal defence
was insanity. Defence psychiatrists testified that the accused was suffering at
the time of the killing from toxic psychosis, a major mental illness, which
caused a break with reality and led to the accused's believing that he was
acting in self‑defence. The psychiatric evidence, however, was
conflicting on the crucial issue of whether the accused was capable of
appreciating the nature and quality of his acts and of knowing that they were
wrong. The jury found the accused guilty on both counts. The accused asked the
Court of Appeal to set aside the conviction and to substitute a verdict of not
guilty by reason of insanity pursuant to s. 613(1) (d) of the Criminal
Code . The Court found that, although there was ample evidence upon which
the jury could properly return a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity,
it was satisfied that the evidence was also capable of reasonably supporting
the jury's conclusion, according to the view which they took of it, that the
defence of insanity had not been proved by the accused on the balance of
probabilities. The Court concluded that it was not at liberty to come to its
own conclusion on the issue of insanity and thereby disregard the verdict
pronounced by a jury. In light of the statutory presumption of sanity, a court
of appeal ought not to interfere with the verdict of a jury unless on
consideration of all the evidence, it is satisfied that it was one which no
jury acting judicially and properly instructed could have reached. This appeal
is to determine whether the Court of Appeal erred (1) in its interpretation and
application of s. 613(1) (d) of the Criminal Code , and (2), in
finding that the verdict of the jury was not unreasonable and could be
supported by the evidence.

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   The
Court of Appeal correctly interpreted and applied s. 613(1) (d) of the Criminal
Code . Section 613(1) (a) governs the determination on appeal of
issues of insanity and s. 613(1) (d) operates in two ways: first, to
enable a court of appeal to determine the issue as would have a trial court
when the issue has not been raised below; and second, to enable the court,
whether acting under s. 613(1) (a) or s. 613(1) (d), to enter, in
the appropriate case, a verdict of ""not guilty on account of
insanity"". This conclusion is consistent with the history of the section
and the proper role of appeal courts. It is also supported by the manner in
which courts of appeal throughout Canada have exercised their jurisdiction
under s. 613(1) (a) and (d) as regards issues of insanity in the
context of appeals against conviction:

 

                   (1)
When raised for the first time in appeal, the court will examine the issue and,
if it is satisfied that the accused was insane at the time of the wrongful act,
it will exercise its power under s. 613(1) (d) to quash the conviction
and substitute the special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.

 

                   (2)
If insanity has been raised at trial and there has been an error of law in the
form of a misdirection on the issue and if the court is satisfied that a proper
direction would have resulted in a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity,
it will substitute that verdict; if the court is not satisfied that, absent the
misdirection, the inevitable verdict would have been not guilty by reason of
insanity, it will decline to act under s. 613(1) (d) but will order a new
trial.

 

                   (3)
If there has been no misdirection, but the verdict is either unreasonable or
cannot be supported by the evidence, the court will set aside the conviction
and substitute the special verdict provided for under s. 613(1) (d).

 

                   (4)
If there has been no error of law and the verdict cannot be said to be
unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence, the court will decline to
interfere with the verdict.

 

                   This
Court, after reviewing the evidence, is in agreement with the Court of Appeal's
finding that there was evidence to support the jury's conclusion and that the
verdict was not unreasonable.

                   The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

                   Lamer J.‑‑ This is an appeal from a judgment of the
Ontario Court of Appeal (1986), 12 O.A.C. 339, upholding Noël Mailloux's
conviction on two counts of second degree murder.

 

The Facts

 

1.                In
February 1983 the appellant, while riding in the rear seat of a car, killed 18‑year‑old
Cindy Thompson and 4‑year‑old Stewart Hawley, who were passengers
in the front seat, by shooting them in the head. He also wounded two other
people. He was indicted on two counts of second degree murder, and at the trial
raised the defences of insanity and, alternatively, intoxication.

 

2.                The
evidence led at trial revealed that the appellant was a member of a motorcycle
club, a drug pusher, and highly suspicious of members of rival clubs. During
the week of the shooting he had taken a great deal of cocaine and slept little.
Defence psychiatrists testified that Mailloux's paranoid personality became
aggravated by the cocaine and the result was a very rare condition, toxic
psychosis. The psychiatrists said that this was a major mental illness which
caused a break with reality and led to the appellant believing that he was
acting in self‑defence. However, on the crucial issue of whether the
appellant was capable of appreciating the nature and quality of his acts and of
knowing that they were wrong, the psychiatric evidence was conflicting. On
examination in chief both psychiatrists said that he was not capable; under
cross‑examination they said that he was. The jury found the appellant
guilty of second degree murder on both counts.

 

3.                Mailloux's
appeal was argued on a number of grounds relating to the trial judge's
direction to the jury on ""disease of the mind"", on whether the
accused met the requirements of s. 16(2)  of the Criminal Code , and on
intoxication. All of these grounds were rejected by the Court of Appeal and are
not at issue before this Court, as the appellant was granted leave to appeal
only on the correct interpretation to be placed on s. 613(1)(d) of the Code.

 

The Legislation

 

4.                For
a greater understanding of the issues in this appeal, I set out the relevant
provisions of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34:

 

          16. (1) No person shall be convicted of an offence in
respect of an act or omission on his part while he was insane.

 

          (2) For the purposes of this section a person
is insane when he is in a state of natural imbecility or has disease of the
mind to an extent that renders him incapable of appreciating the nature and
quality of an act or omission or of knowing that an act or omission is wrong.

 

          (3) A person who has specific delusions, but
is in other respects sane, shall not be acquitted on the ground of insanity
unless the delusions caused him to believe in the existence of a state of
things that, if it existed, would have justified or excused his act or
omission.

 

          (4) Every one shall, until the contrary is
proved, be presumed to be and to have been sane.

 

          613. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction or
against a verdict that the appellant is unfit, on account of insanity, to stand
his trial, or against a special verdict of not guilty on account of insanity,
the court of appeal

 

(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the
opinion that

 

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that
it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,

 

(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside
on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or

 

(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;

 

                                                                    ...

 

(d) may set aside a conviction and find the
appellant not guilty on account of insanity and order the appellant to be kept
in safe custody to await the pleasure of the lieutenant governor where it is
of the opinion that, although the appellant committed the act or made the
omission charged against him, he was insane at the time the act was committed
or the omission was made, so that he was not criminally responsible for his
conduct; [Emphasis added.]

 

The Ontario Court
of Appeal

 

5.                Before
the Court of Appeal the appellant argued that given the psychiatric evidence,
the drug abuse, and the bizarre nature of the accused's conduct, the Court of
Appeal should substitute a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity pursuant
to s. 613(1)(d) of the Code. In response to this argument
Lacourcière J.A. held (at pp. 343‑44):

 

          Dealing first with our power to substitute a
verdict under s. 613(1) (d), there certainly was ample evidence upon which the
jury could properly return a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.
However, we are satisfied that the evidence was also capable of reasonably
supporting the jury's conclusion, according to the view which they took of it,
that the defence of insanity had not been proved by the accused on the balance
of probabilities.

 

          This court is not at liberty to come to its
own conclusion on the issue of insanity and thereby disregard the verdict
pronounced by a jury. Having regard to the statutory presumption of sanity,
this court ought not to interfere with the verdict of a jury unless on
consideration of all the evidence, we are satisfied that it was one which no
jury acting judicially and properly instructed could have reached. See R. v.
Prince (1971), 6 C.C.C. (2d) 183 at p. 185. [Emphasis added.]

 

The Points at Issue

 

a) Whether the
Court of Appeal for Ontario erred in law in the interpretation and application
of s. 613(1) (d) of the Criminal Code .

 

As I am of the view
that the Court of Appeal did not err, the second issue to dispose of this
appeal is

 

b) Whether the
Court of Appeal erred in finding that the verdict of the jury was not
unreasonable and could be supported by the evidence.

 

The Appellant's
Arguments

 

6.                I
should mention that I find great assistance in this case in the factums of both
the appellant and the respondent who have covered and analyzed thoroughly the
history of s. 613(1) (d) and the case law in this country and in the
U.K., even though my reading of the history is somewhat different.

 

7.                Appellant
argues that the Court of Appeal was wrong in applying the test set out at s.
613(1) (a)(i), that is, whether the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be
supported by the evidence. Though acknowledging that provincial courts of
appeal have consistently refused to interfere with a jury's verdict in insanity
cases when there is evidence to support it, the appellant says that they have
been in error in so refusing. The plain meaning of the words used in s. 613(1) (d)
of the Criminal Code  impose upon a court of appeal a positive duty to
review the evidence and to arrive at its own conclusion on the issue of
insanity regardless of the applicability of the other provisions of s. 613 . In
that regard, the appellant relies upon the primary rule of statutory
construction, namely, that the terms of a statutory enactment are to be given
their plain and rational meaning in order to promote the objects of the
statute.

 

8.                Furthermore,
the object of s. 613(1) (d) is to ensure compliance with s. 16(1) of the Code
and to ensure an appropriate balance to the statutory presumption of sanity
under s. 16(4) of the Code.

 

9.                The
section should be interpreted in the manner contended for because:

 

a) A court of appeal which seeks to invoke the section
may only ""set aside a conviction""; it cannot ""allow the
appeal"" as provided in s. 613(1) (a).

 

b) Where a conviction is ""set aside"" the court
of appeal must ""find the Appellant not guilty on account of
insanity""; it cannot order a new trial . . . [A] judicial finding must be
based on evidence. In order to make such a finding the court must, of its own
accord, review the evidence and reach an opinion.

 

c) The section specifically requires that the court of
appeal may only set aside the conviction, ""where it is of the
opinion"" that the Appellant was insane at the relevant time . . .

 

d) A fresh review of the evidence permits a court of
appeal to determine whether the medical evidence of insanity was unjustifiably
rejected by the jury, whether the non‑medical evidence of insanity was
given due weight by the jury in light of the medical evidence and the
surrounding circumstances of the case, and whether on the whole of the case the
Appellant satisfied the burden of demonstrating insanity on a balance of
probabilities.

 

The Arguments of
Respondent Crown

 

10.              The
Crown invites us not to give a literal interpretation to s. 613(1) (d)
but a purposive one, taking into account the context within which the section
is to be found, its legislative history, and, finally, the proper role of
courts of appeal in relation to the review of findings of facts.

 

11.              The
Crown's position is stated as follows:

 

a) where the issue of insanity has not been raised
at trial, s. 613(1) (d) empowers a Court of Appeal to explore, on its own
motion, the merits of the defence and to substitute a special verdict of not
guilty by reason of insanity, thereby conforming to the mandatory provision of
s. 16(1):

 

                                                                    ...

 

b) where the issue of insanity has been considered
by the trier of fact, s. 613(1) (d) permits a Court of Appeal, having proper
regard to the well settled division of functions separating the roles of the
triers of fact and courts of review, to substitute the special verdict of not
guilty by reason of insanity, where,

 

i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it
is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,

 

ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside
on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or

 

iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice,

 

that is, by
applying s. 613(1) (a).

 

Analysis

 

12.              The
first question which must be addressed is whether s. 613 is worded in such a
way that it is clear and without any ambiguities that only s. 613(1) (d)
governs a court of appeal's jurisdiction as regards an insanity issue. If so,
and absent any absurdity resulting from such an interpretation, that would end
the matter in favour of the appellant's position.

 

13.              Because
of the way the section is structured, I think that it is unclear whether s.
613(1) (a) applies to an insanity issue or not. At first blush, s.
613(1) (d) appears all‑encompassing. However, the reference to
verdicts on insanity issues at the beginning of the whole section makes it
debatable whether that reference is introductory to s. 613(1) (d) only or
whether it is also introductory to s. 613(1) (a).

 

14.              As a
plain reading of the whole section can be supportive of either view, we should
seek out the purpose of the section as regards insanity issues before a court
of appeal, having regard to the proper respective functions of trial and appeal
courts. The legislative history of the section is most useful in that regard.

 

15.              Prior
to 1923, insanity issues were dealt with in appeal under the general appeal
provisions which were at the time ancestor sections of s. 613(1) (a).
There was no provision such as s. 613(1) (d), which was introduced in its
actual form in 1961, and in a somewhat different form in 1923.

 

16.              The
courts of appeal were then generally enabled, when allowing an appeal, to order
a new trial or enter an acquittal, as is the case today. Of course, on an
insanity issue, as there was no section enabling them to substitute the verdict
of not guilty by reason of insanity that the trial court should in their view
have entered, and as they did not want to acquit simpliciter, one finds, upon
reviewing the cases over that period, that pleas of insanity successful in
appeal resulted in the ordering of a new trial (see for example, R. v.
Blythe (1909), 15 C.C.C. 224 (Ont. C.A.))

 

17.              In
1923, by virtue of s. 9 of An Act to amend the Criminal Code, S.C. 1923,
c. 41, new ss. 1014 and 1016 were added to Part XIX of the existing Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1906, c. 146:

 

          1014. (1) On the hearing of any such appeal against
conviction the court of appeal shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion‑‑

 

(a) that the verdict of the jury should be set
aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having
regard to the evidence; or

 

(b) that the judgment of the trial court should
be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision of any question of law; or

 

(c) that on any ground there was a miscarriage of
justice; and

 

(d) in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.

 

          (2) The court may also dismiss the appeal if,
notwithstanding that it is of opinion that on any of the grounds above
mentioned the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is also of
the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually
occurred.

 

          (3) Subject to the special provisions
contained in the following sections of this Part, when the court of appeal
allows an appeal against conviction it may

 

(a) quash the conviction and direct a judgment
and verdict of acquittal to be entered; or

 

(b) direct a new trial;

 

and in either case may make such other order as justice
requires.

 

          (4) When the court of appeal directs a new
trial in the case of an appellant convicted, under the provisions of Part XVI
or Part XVIII of this Act, of an indictable offence, if his consent or election
was necessary to give jurisdiction to the magistrate or judge before whom he
was tried, the new trial shall be before a jury if the appellant so requests in
his notice of appeal or notice of application for leave to appeal, but
otherwise shall, in the discretion of the court of appeal, be either before the
proper magistrate or judge or before a jury.

 

          1016. (1) If it appears to the court of appeal that an
appellant, though not properly convicted on some count or part of the
indictment, has been properly convicted on some other count or part of the
indictment, the court may either affirm the sentence passed on the appellant by
the trial court or pass such sentence in substitution therefor as the court
thinks proper, and as may be warranted in law by the verdict on the count or
part of the indictment on which the court considers that the appellant has been
properly convicted.

 

          (2) Where an appellant has been convicted of
an offence and the jury or, as the case may be, the judge or magistrate, could
on the indictment have found him guilty of some other offence, and on the
actual finding it appears to the court of appeal that the jury, judge or
magistrate must have been satisfied of facts which proved him guilty of that
other offence, the court of appeal may, instead of allowing or dismissing the
appeal, substitute for the verdict found a verdict of guilty of that other
offence, and pass such sentence in substitution for the sentence passed by the
trial court as may be warranted in law for that other offence, not being a
sentence of greater severity.

 

          (3) Where on the conviction of the appellant
the jury have found a special verdict, and the court of appeal considers that a
wrong conclusion has been arrived at by the trial court as to the effect of
that verdict, the court of appeal may, instead of allowing the appeal, order
such conclusion to be recorded as appears to the court to be in law required by
the verdict, and pass such sentence in substitution for the sentence passed by
the trial court as may be warranted in law.

 

          (4) If on any appeal it appears to the
court of appeal that, although the appellant was guilty of the act or omission
charged against him, he was insane at the time the act was done or omission
made so as not to be responsible according to law for his actions, the court
may quash the sentence passed by the trial court and order the appellant to be
kept in strict custody, in such place and such manner as to the court of appeal
seems fit, until the pleasure of the lieutenant‑governor of the province
is known. [Emphasis added.]

 

18.              But
nothing changed in 1923, with the introduction of s. 1016(4). Issues of
insanity continued to be dealt with through those general provisions of s. 1014
which are similar to s. 613(1) (a). A review of the cases shows that,
whenever successful, such appeals resulted in new trials under s. 1014 (see R.
v. Gibbons (1946), 86 C.C.C. 20 (Ont. C.A.)) The courts did not resort to
the power available under s. 1016(4) (see Hébert v. The Queen, [1955]
S.C.R. 120). It is to be noted that s. 1016(4) did not enable the courts to
quash the conviction but enabled them only to modify the sentence. The courts
obviously felt it unfair, a sentiment that was also later expressed by the
McRuer Commission, to let an improper conviction stand when the proper remedy,
that is a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, was available in lower
courts albeit only after undergoing a new trial.

 

19.              What
was then the purpose of s. 1016(4)? In seeking an answer one must not overlook
the fact that a new trial could be triggered through the general provisions of
s. 1014 only if there had been below an error of law, unreasonable findings, or
miscarriage of justice as regards the issue of insanity. This could occur only
if insanity was an issue raised at trial. In my view, s. 1016(4) was introduced
to enable a court of appeal to give some relief, albeit incomplete, to the
accused when the insanity issue was raised for the first time in appeal.

 

20.              As I
have said, I have found no instances in which s. 1016(4) and its successor
section (until it was modified in 1961) was resorted to. This is probably
because of the fact that, when insanity issues were not raised at trial by the
defence, they could and were in this country successfully raised when
appropriate by the Crown. In 1961, what was s. 1016(4), and has since become s.
613(1) (d) at the time of this case, was amended. The only change that
was made enabled the court, when applying the section, to enter an acquittal by
reason of insanity.

 

21.              The
question therefore becomes:

 

Was Parliament, in
fact, making a fundamental change to the dynamics of the appeal process and to
the traditional role of appeal courts and giving them full unfettered first
instance jurisdiction by allowing all insanity issues to be determined under s.
613(1) (d), including the cases where the issue was raised at trial and
determined by the trier of fact?

 

or

 

By giving appeal
courts the power to enter the verdict that the trial court should have entered,
was Parliament addressing the two mischiefs I have identified in the historical
review; first, the anomaly of having to order a new trial after reviewing the finding
below, and second, the injustice of leaving untouched the verdict of guilty
because the issue of insanity, though successful in the court of appeal, had
been raised in that court for the first time?

 

With respect for
the contrary view, I think the latter to be the sounder, as being more
consistent with the history of the section and the proper role of appeal
courts.

 

22.              Indeed,
a few years earlier, the Royal Commission on the Law of Insanity as a Defence
in Criminal Cases was in the process of investigating this entire area. The Report
of the Royal Commission on the Law of Insanity as a Defence in Criminal Cases
(1956), also known as the McRuer Report on Insanity, ultimately recommended to
Parliament that the power under the predecessor of s. 613(1) (d) only to
substitute a sentence and not to change the verdict was inconsistent with a
verdict rendered under s. 523 (now s. 542), under which the accused person is
declared to be ""acquitted on account of insanity"". As the Commission
noted (at p. 37):

 

It is also inconsistent with the whole concept of
Canadian law, under which no one should be found guilty of a criminal offence
who is not criminally responsible according to the definition of criminal
responsibility contained in the Criminal Code .

 

23.              Nowhere
in the report did the Commission discuss or suggest ‑‑ let alone
justify ‑‑ that the traditional role of courts of appeal should be
so fundamentally different when dealing with issues of insanity. The
Commission's only concern was that alluded to in the passage cited above.

 

24.              That
recommendation was adopted by Parliament without more discussion in 1961, as is
indicated by the statement of the Minister of Justice at the time, the
Honourable Davie Fulton (Debates of the House of Commons, 1960‑61,
vol. VI, at p. 6570):

 

Mr. Chairman, in respect to clause 26 [the proposed s.
592(1)(d) now s. 613(1) (d)], my hon. friends opposite asked if I
could give the background. Clause 26 is the clause which arises out of the
recommendation of the McRuer commission on the law of insanity.

 

25.              I am
therefore of the view that s. 613(1) (a) governs the determination in
appeal of issues of insanity and that s. 613(1) (d) operates in two ways:
first, to enable a court of appeal to determine the issue as would have a trial
court when the issue has not been raised below; and second, to enable the
court, whether acting under s. 613(1) (a) or s. 613(1) (d), to
enter, in the appropriate case, a verdict of ""not guilty on account of
insanity"". I am supported in this view by the manner in which courts of
appeal throughout Canada have exercised their jurisdiction under s. 613(1) (a)
and (d) as regards issues of insanity in the context of appeals against
conviction, which was usefully summarized by respondent's counsel in its
factum, substantially as follows:

 

1.       When
raised for the first time in appeal the court will examine the issue and if it
is satisfied that the appellant was insane at the time of the wrongful act, it
will exercise its power under s. 613(1) (d) to quash the conviction and
to substitute the special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.

‑‑       R. v. Hendry (1985), 37 Man.
R. (2d) 66 (Man. C.A.)

 

2.       If
insanity has been raised at trial and there has been an error of law in the
form of a misdirection on the issue and,

 

a)       if the court is satisfied that a proper
direction would have resulted in a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity,
it will substitute that verdict;

‑‑       R. v. Winters (1985), 51
Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 271 (Nfld. C.A.);

 

b)       if the court is not satisfied that, absent
the misdirection, the inevitable verdict would have been not guilty by reason
of insanity, it will decline to act under s. 613(1) (d) but will order a
new trial.

 

‑‑       R. v. O'Brien, [1966] 3

‑‑       R. v. Baltzer (1974), 27
C.C.C. (2d) 118 (N.S.S.C. App. Div.)

 

3.       If
there has been no misdirection, but the verdict is either unreasonable or
cannot be supported by the evidence, the court will set aside the conviction
and substitute the special verdict provided for under s. 613(1) (d).

437 (Ont. C.A.);

 

‑‑       R. v. Scono (1986), 13
O.A.C. 23 (Ont. C.A.)

 

4.       If
there has been no error of law and the verdict cannot be said to be
unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence, the court will decline to
interfere with the verdict.

‑‑       R. v. Leboeuf (1979), 57
C.C.C. (2d) 257 (Que. C.A.)

 

26.              Now,
I turn to the second issue. Stated in technical terms, the finding by the jury
was that the accused had not rebutted by a preponderance of evidence the
presumption of sanity. After reviewing the evidence, I am in agreement with the
Court of Appeal's finding that there was evidence supportive of the jury's
conclusion and that the verdict, in that regard, was not unreasonable.

 

27.              I
would therefore dismiss this appeal.

                   Evidence ‑‑
Evidence obtained in violation of the Charter ‑‑ Whether or not
evidence should be excluded for bringing administration of justice into
disrepute.

 

                   The constable in
charge of the drug section at an R.C.M.P. detachment sought and obtained a
search warrant under s. 10(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. The search
warrant named four officers. A change in shift caused the constable in charge
to seek authorization by telephone from the justice of the peace to substitute
two other officers. Two officers not named in the amended warrant assisted in
executing the search warrant.

 

                   When the police arrived
to search the appellant's apartment appellant was arrested for possession of
marijuana and read the standard police warning. Appellant attempted to
telephone his lawyer but the constable in charge told appellant that he could
not telephone until the police had ""matters under control"": the
police wanted to question two other men in the apartment and to locate two
registered revolvers. The drugs and paraphernalia were seized by two officers
named in the warrant. Appellant was allowed to telephone his lawyer from the
police station an hour and forty minutes after the search began. He had not
made a further request to use the telephone after his initial request and the
police did not advise him again of his right to retain counsel.

 

                   The trial judge
found that appellant's right to counsel had been violated, excluded the
evidence seized by the police and, absent other evidence, dismissed the charge.
The Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial. The two
major issues raised here were: (1) was the search invalid because it did not
comply with the requirements of s. 10 of the Narcotic Control Act and
therefore unreasonable under s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  and (2) should the evidence discovered in the search have been
excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter  because of the denial of the
right to counsel or the alleged breach of s. 8 .

 

                   Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and Beetz, McIntyre, La
Forest and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ.: A warrant issued under s. 10(2) of the Narcotic
Control Act for the search of a dwelling place for narcotics is
significantly wider in scope than a normal search warrant issued under s. 443 
of the Criminal Code . This wider scope is counterbalanced by the
requirement that specific officers be named in the warrant and that they
personally execute it and be responsible for the control and conduct of the
search. If the named officers are truly in control, participate in the search,
and are present throughout, the use of unnamed assistants who are closely
supervised by them does not invalidate the search or the warrant. The naming
requirement is not met by a warrant directed to a large number of peace
officers.

 

                   The section 8 
guarantee against unreasonable search or seizure was not breached here. The
search warrant was validly issued and validly executed. Advance authorization
for searches by an impartial official capable of acting judicially is
important. Even if the substitution of the two officers by telephone
authorization was not authorized by the Narcotic Control Act, respect
for the spirit of s. 8  of the Charter  and awareness of the limitations
on police search powers was shown.

 

                   The police violated
the appellant's right to counsel. The violation of this right did not occur
when the constable in charge initially prevented him from telephoning his
lawyer because of the need to ensure a potentially volatile situation was under
control. The police had no reason not to allow the appellant to telephone a
lawyer once the accused had been arrested, the weapons located, and the other
two people had left, and the police were clearly in control. The denial of
counsel began from that point.

 

                   Section 24(2)  does
not require a causal link between the Charter  infringement and the
discovery of the evidence. All evidence gathered following a violation of a Charter 
right should be considered as within the scope of s. 24(2) . The first inquiry
under s. 24(2)  is to determine whether a Charter  violation occurred in
the course of obtaining the evidence. A temporal link between the infringement
of the Charter  and the discovery of the evidence, while not
determinative, figures prominently in this assessment, particularly where the Charter 
violation and the discovery of the evidence occur in the course of a single
transaction. A temporal connection will not suffice when the evidence is too
remote.

 

                   The narcotics in
this appeal were obtained in a manner that infringed the Charter . The
chain of events was sufficient to clear the first branch of s. 24(2) .

 

                   The factors
concerning the fairness of the trial are especially important when the right to
counsel has been violated because of the concern that an accused may have been
incriminated by statements improperly elicited by the police. Nevertheless, s.
24(2) is not an automatic exclusionary rule: not every breach of the right to
counsel will result in the exclusion of evidence. Here, the Charter 
breach was inadvertent and was not part of a larger pattern of disregard for Charter 
rights, no self‑incriminatory statements were elicited, and the accused
was not mistreated. The admission of the marijuana would not render the trial
unfair. Indeed, the exclusion of the evidence, not its admission, would tend to
bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

 

                   Per Lamer J.: The reasons of Dickson C.J.
were concurred in. To require some nexus when ""evidence is obtained in a
manner that infringed the Charter "" is too difficult a test to apply
and the approach proposed by Le Dain J. in R. v. Therens
should be followed.

 

                   Per Wilson J.: Appellant's right to
counsel was violated when he was denied the use of the telephone to call his
lawyer upon being advised that he was under arrest. Notwithstanding the
understandable concern of the police to get ""matters under control"",
there is no internal qualification in s. 10 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  permitting the police to postpone the
appellant's exercise of his right to counsel. Section 10 (b) uses the
words ""without delay"". Section 1  of the Charter  is the sole
source of reasonable limits. These limits must be ""prescribed by law""
and cannot be imposed by the police in their discretion except in a case of
extreme urgency or threat to their own safety. This is not such a case.

 

                   A search conducted
in face of a Charter  violation cannot be a reasonable search under s. 8 
even if conducted pursuant to a valid search warrant. The legislation
authorizing the issuance of search warrants does not expressly or by necessary
implication or through its operating requirements override the citizen's s. 10 (b)
rights.

 

                   The admission of
the evidence in this case would not, however, bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.

                   The judgment of
Dickson C.J. and Beetz, McIntyre, La Forest and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ.
was delivered by

 

1.                       The
Chief Justice‑‑The appellant Joseph Colin Strachan was
charged with unlawfully having in his possession a narcotic, to wit, cannabis
(marijuana) for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 4(2) of the Narcotic
Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1. He was acquitted at trial. The
trial verdict was reversed on appeal. The appellant now appeals as of right to
this Court.

 

2.                       This case involves
evidence seized during a search of a dwelling‑house under a search
warrant issued under s. 10(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. The appellant
argues that the search was unreasonable, and therefore contrary to s. 8  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms . He further submits that his right to
counsel under s. 10 (b) of the Charter  was denied. He contends
that the evidence of the drugs and drug‑related paraphernalia found in
the dwelling was properly excluded by the trial judge under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .

 

3.                       It should be noted that
this case has been argued throughout on the law as it stood prior to the Criminal
Law Amendment Act, 1985, S.C. 1985, c. 19, ss. 69‑71, which amended
the search warrant provisions of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34,

The Facts

 

5.                       On September 9, 1983,
Constable Bisceglia was the officer in charge of the Drug Section of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police (R.C.M.P.) Detachment in Campbell River, British
Columbia. That day, a confidential source told him that the appellant had a
quantity of marijuana at his apartment. Two other sources had given Constable
Bisceglia the same tip within the previous few days. Early in the afternoon,
Constable Bisceglia appeared before a justice of the peace and applied under s.
10 of the Narcotic Control Act for a warrant to search a dwelling for
narcotics. The justice of the peace issued the search warrant. In compliance
with s. 10(2) of the Act, the warrant named Constables Bisceglia, Arseneault,
Clark, and Underhill, all of the R.C.M.P., as the peace officers authorized to
enter and search the dwelling. The warrant was valid between 3:00 p.m. and 7:00
p.m. of that day.

 

6.                       The officers went to the
appellant's apartment at 4:00 p.m. but no‑one was home. They did not
attempt to enter but went about other duties. At approximately 6:00 p.m.,
Constable Arseneault learned that the appellant was at home, but was leaving
shortly for Vancouver, and would not be back for two or three days. Constable
Bisceglia decided to execute the warrant immediately, but Constables Clark and
Underhill were about to go off duty. Constable Bisceglia telephoned the justice
of the peace who had issued the search warrant, explained the circumstances,
and asked if it would be possible to substitute two other officers. The justice
of the peace authorized the substitution and the officers went to the
appellant's apartment, arriving there around 6:20 p.m. All four were dressed in
civilian clothes.

 

7.                       The police officers
knocked on the door. The appellant answered. Two other men were in the
apartment, in the living room. Constable Bisceglia gave the appellant a copy of
the search warrant, showed his identification, and arrested the appellant for
possession of marijuana. He then read the standard police warning, including
the right to counsel guaranteed by the Charter . The appellant
immediately picked up the phone and said he was going to call his lawyer, but
Constable Bisceglia told him that he could not telephone until the police had
""matters under control."" Constable Bisceglia then asked the appellant
for his full name, address and age, and for some identification. He also asked
the appellant some questions concerning his marijuana usage. Constable
Bisceglia then asked the other two men for their names. Approximately forty
minutes after the police entered the apartment, the two men left. While
Constable Bisceglia interviewed the appellant and the two men, the other
officers searched the apartment. After the two men left, Constable Bisceglia
assisted in the search. Constable Vanschaik and Corpo­ral McBratney, the two
substituted officers, did not seize items they discovered in the search, but
pointed them out to Constables Bisceglia and Arseneault to seize. Constables
Bisceglia and Arseneault together seized about 300 grams of ""green plant‑like
material,"" a set of scales, plastic bags, a ""hook up"" [sic]
pipe, and a ""huge number"" of bills totalling $3,193. After the
conclusion of the search, the police took the accused to the police station,
arriving there around 8:00 p.m. He was then allowed to telephone his lawyer.

 

8.                       At the voir dire on
the admission of the evidence, Constable Bisceglia was asked to explain what he
had meant when he told the appellant that he could not telephone his lawyer
until the officers had matters under control. Constable Bisceglia explained
that he wanted to find out who were the two additional occupants of the
apartment. He was also aware that the appellant had two restricted firearms at
the apartment, for which the appellant had the appropriate registration
certificates. Constable Bisceglia explained that he wanted to locate the two revolvers.

 

9.                       After his initial attempt
to contact counsel, the appellant made no further request to use the telephone.
The police officers did not advise him again of his right to retain counsel
after the initial warnings.

Judgments of the
British Columbia Courts

 

1. County
Court (unreported)

 

10.                     A voir dire was held
on the validity of the search warrant and its execution. Four issues were
raised: (i) whether the warrant as originally issued complied with the
requirements of s. 10(2) of the Narcotic Control Act; (ii) whether the
substitution of two officers for two of the named officers invalidated the
warrant; (iii) whether the participation of two officers, not named in the
warrant, invalidated the search; and (iv) whether there was a breach of the
accused's right to retain and instruct counsel under s. 10 (b) of the Charter .

 

11.                     Millward Co. Ct. J., sitting
without a jury, decided the first three issues against the accused. He held
that the formalities of s. 10(2) had been followed when the warrant originally
was issued. Without commenting on whether or not the justice of the peace had
the power to substitute the two officers, Millward Co. Ct. J. held the warrant
was still valid when executed. On the third point, he held that the search was
not unlawful simply because unnamed officers assisted the named officer in
executing the search.

 

12.                     Millward Co. Ct. J. then
examined the Charter  point. He held that the police had denied the
accused his right to counsel by refusing to allow him to telephone his lawyer.
He did not accept that the initial denial could be justified by either of the
grounds advanced by the police, the presence of unknown third parties or the
knowledge that the accused had two restricted weapons in the apartment. Even
assuming that those two factors justified the denial of counsel, Millward Co.
Ct. J. noted that the police had matters under control once the accused was
arrested and the other two people had left. Millward Co. Ct. J. held that at
that point at the latest, the accused should have been permitted to telephone
his lawyer. The failure to allow him to do so was a ""flagrant denial""
of the right to counsel. Millward Co. Ct. J. then considered whether the
evidence seized by the police should be excluded under s. 24(2) . He accepted
that there was no causal connection between the denial of the right to counsel
and the evidence obtained by the search. Millward Co. Ct. J. considered the
judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Rao (1984), 40 C.R.
(3d) 1, another case concerning a denial of the right to counsel during a
search. Although in that case there was evidence that the police grossly abused
and mistreated the accused, Millward Co. Ct. J. decided that the two cases were
parallel. He said:

 

        Here, there is no suggestion that the police
officers abused or mistreated the accused man in any way. Apart from that
element, I find the two cases to be parallel. And it is my respectful view of
the facts here that the flagrant denial to the accused person of his
constitutional right to consult counsel immediately after having been informed
of his right to do so by the officer cannot be condoned in a free and
democratic society. And it is my further view that the admission of the
evidence of search and seizure that took place following that denial would
bring the administration of justice into disrepute. And so, I rule that the
evidence is not admissible.

 

13.                     As the Crown had no other
evidence, the charge was dismissed.

 

2.      Court
of Appeal (reported at (1986), 25 D.L.R. (4th) 567)

 

14.                     The Crown appealed to the
British Columbia Court of Appeal, composed of Hinkson, Craig, and Esson JJ.A.
Counsel for the Crown conceded that the police had violated the accused's right
to counsel when they refused to allow him to communicate with his lawyer. The
issue was whether the material should have been excluded under s. 24(2) ,
particularly in the absence of any direct causal relationship between the Charter 
breach and the discovery of the evidence. Esson J.A., speaking for the Court of
Appeal, in a long and scholarly judgment, held that the evidence ought not to
have been excluded, set aside the acquittal, and ordered a new trial.

 

15.                     Esson J.A. reviewed this
Court's decision in R. v. Therens, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 613. He concluded
that the majority's decision was closely tied to the type of evidence under
consideration in that case, namely, potentially incriminating evidence that the
person was required by law to provide to the police. Esson J.A. considered that
even if the majority in R. v. Therens interpreted s. 24(2)  to allow for
automatic exclusion, that interpretation was limited to the type of evidence
there in issue. He thought the case left open the scope of the exclusionary
rule in general. He also considered that the case did not establish that there
must be a causal relationship between a Charter  violation and the
obtaining of evidence, but the presence or absence of a causal relationship is
an important factor in the decision.

 

16.                     Esson J.A. then examined the
trial judge's decision in this case. He disagreed with the trial judge's
reliance on the R. v. Rao case, supra, since in that case there
was an illegal, unreasonable search and gross mistreatment of the accused.
Esson J.A. held that those were relevant considerations. He quoted the
following passage, at p. 585, from the judgment of Martin J.A. in R. v. Rao:

 

        The trial judge found, however, that the
respondent was detained and, notwithstanding that he was detained, he was
denied the right to communicate with a lawyer despite his request to be allowed
to do so. Further, it seems clear on the facts found by the trial judge that
the respondent was denied the right to communicate with his lawyer after he had
been arrested. The trial judge also found that the respondent was grossly
abused and mistreated by one or more officers (not Constables Sills and
Lapierre) and that the police misconduct threw light on their mental attitude
in denying the respondent the right to communicate with counsel. On the
findings of the trial judge there was a gross abuse of power and a flagrant
denial to the respondent of his constitutional rights which cannot be condoned
in a free and democratic society. On the facts found by the trial judge he was
entitled to hold that the admission of the evidence of the seizure of the
narcotics would bring the administration of justice into disrepute and, on the
facts found by him, I would have reached the same conclusion.

 

By contrast, Esson
J.A. pointed out that there was no such illegal conduct in this case. Unlike
the trial judge, he thought Constable Bisceglia had a genuine reason to be
concerned about the presence of guns and strangers in the apartment and pointed
out there was no challenge to the constable's good faith in advancing this
reason for wanting to get things ""under control."" Esson J.A. also
disagreed with the trial judge's characterization of the Charter 
violation as a ""flagrant denial"" of the right to counsel. While any
denial of the right to counsel is a serious matter, Esson J.A. stated that some
violations are more serious than others. He observed, at p. 587:

 

        It has been said that the right to consult
counsel is of such fundamental importance in criminal cases that any violation
of the right must be viewed seriously. I do not disagree with that. The fact
remains that some violations are more serious than others. In deciding whether
to exclude evidence, regard must be had to the relative seriousness of the
particular violation. This violation was towards the less serious end of the
scale.

 

He saw nothing
exceptional about this case to distinguish it from other cases where the right
to counsel was denied, and thought that calling the denial ""flagrant""
added nothing to the analysis. Esson J.A. believed the trial judge's approach
amounted to an automatic exclusion of evidence whenever the right to counsel
was violated.

 

17.                     Esson J.A. then went on to
consider the scope of the exclusionary rule under s. 24(2) . He considered the
language of the section and cases in British Columbia and Ontario that had
interpreted it. He also made an extensive survey of the automatic exclusion rule
in the United States. He concluded that the American rule had evolved in a
society much different from Canada, a society of extreme racial prejudice and
brutal police misconduct. While the automatic exclusion rule may be necessary
in that setting, he did not think it appropriate in Canada. He expressed
himself as being in entire agreement with the reasons of Zuber J.A. dissenting
in R. v. Duguay (1985), 18 D.L.R. (4th) 32 (Ont. C.A.), and added, at
p. 589:

 

Without repeating what he said, I wish to draw attention
to certain aspects of the majority judgment which, in my respectful view,
illustrate some troubling aspects which underlie the treatment of s. 24(2)  as a
rule of virtual automatic exclusion. One aspect is the acceptance of the
American exclusionary rule as part of our law without considering whether the
reasons for its adoption exist in Canada and without regard for its undoubted
adverse effects. A second aspect is the tendency to treat police as being
inherently untrustworthy and lacking in respect for the law, and as likely to
act properly only if exposed to the risk of deterrent measures. Related to this
second aspect is a tendency to treat crime as relatively insignificant and thus
to regard its prevention and detection as less important to society than
control of police behaviour. The two aspects are related in that they find
their clearest, if not their only, support in American jurisprudence.

 

Esson J.A. also
considered that the language of s. 24(2)  made it clear that exclusion was not
to be an automatic remedy for every Charter  violation. He concluded that
exclusion should be confined to those relatively rare cases where there is some
real reason to describe a Charter  violation as flagrant, and in which
exclusion would not unduly prejudice the public interest in law enforcement.
Esson J.A. concluded that even if there had been a causal connection in this
case, there was very little in the circumstances which would justify a
conclusion that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute. Since there was no causal connection, the remedy of
exclusion was clearly not appropriate.

 

18.                     Esson J.A. also rejected the
accused's argument that the search warrant was invalid. He thought that the
position was simply that only two of the four authorized officers carried out
the search, with the assistance of two other officers. In such circumstances
the search was lawful. Since no other challenge to the search was made, there
was no breach of s. 8 .

 

                           IV

 

Issues

 

19.                     The accused appeals as of
right, under s. 618(2)(a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34,
from the setting aside of the acquittal by the British Columbia Court of
Appeal. The respondent Crown concedes the appellant's right to counsel under s.
10 (b) was violated, but argues that the evidence should not be excluded.
Two major issues are raised by the appeal: (1) was the search invalid because
it did not comply with the requirements of s. 10 of the Narcotic Control Act
and was thus unreasonable under s. 8  of the Charter  and (2) should the
evidence discovered in the search have been excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter 
because of the denial of the right to counsel or the alleged breach of
s. 8 ?

 

20.                     Counsel for the appellant
alleges that the Court of Appeal erred in holding that:

 

 

 

(a)     The incriminating evidence obtained by the
police in this case should be treated differently from other classes of
evidence, such as the result of a breathalyzer test, when considering whether
or not it should be excluded under section 24(2)  of the Charter ;

 

(b)     the admission of the evidence obtained
while the rights of the Appellant under Section 10 (b) of the Charter  were being
denied, would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute;

 

(c)     a search conducted pursuant to a search
warrant issued under section 10(2) of the Narcotic Control Act, supra,
which authorized four named peace officers to search, was valid notwithstanding
that the search was conducted by four peace officers, only two of whom were so
named.

 

                           V

 

The Validity of
the Search Warrant

 

21.                     Although the appellant's
argument concentrates largely on the exclusion of evidence, he also contests
the validity of the search warrant and the substitution of two unnamed officers
for two of the named officers. The appellant argues that the substitution was
not authorized by the Narcotic Control Act and that the search was
illegal. He argues from this that the search was in breach of s. 8  of the Charter ,
which would be an additional reason to exclude the evidence under s. 24(2) .

 

22.                     One of the appellant's
points can be disposed of very quickly. Appellant in his factum argues that the
search warrant was invalid from the start, because s. 10(2) of the Narcotic
Control Act speaks of ""a peace officer named therein"". Appellant
argues that since s. 10(2) uses the singular, it is questionable whether a
warrant under s. 10(2) can name more than one peace officer. This argument is
answered completely by s. 26(7) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. I‑23, which states: ""Words in the singular include the plural,
and words in the plural include the singular."" Section 10(2) of the Narcotic
Control Act authorizes a justice to name more than one officer in the
warrant. The warrant in this case was validly issued.

 

23.                     The next question is whether
the substitution of the two unnamed officers for two of the named officers
affected the validity of the warrant. The appellant argues there is no
authority in the Narcotic Control Act to allow the issuing justice to
substitute some officers for others. The appellant argues the warrant was
invalidly executed because of the improper substitution.

 

24.                     It is not necessary in this
case to decide whether a justice can amend a warrant in the way attempted by
the justice in this case. The warrant was executed by two of the four named
officers. The question is whether or not those two officers could rely on the
assistance of other officers, not named in the warrant, to carry out the
search. If named officers can be assisted by unnamed officers, it matters not
whether the purported substitution was valid.

 

25.                     Two provincial courts of
appeal have considered whether a named officer can be assisted by unnamed
officers; both have concluded that assistance is permitted. In R. v. Fekete
(1985), 44 C.R. (3d) 92, the Ontario Court of Appeal (Martin, Zuber and Goodman
JJ.A.) held that while a named officer cannot delegate the execution of the
warrant to anyone else, he or she can execute the search with the assistance of
unnamed officers. Zuber J.A. for the court pointed out that s. 10(4) of the Narcotic
Control Act expressly authorizes the named officer to call for assistance
to break open anything necessary to be searched. Zuber J.A. held that this
subsection simply illustrates the power of the named officer to rely on
assistants.

 

26.                     The Alberta Court of Appeal
considered the same issue in R. v. Heikel and MacKay (1984), 57 A.R.
221, in connection with a search warrant issued under the Food and Drugs Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. F‑27. Section 37(2) of that Act is equivalent to s. 10(2)
of the Narcotic Control Act and requires that the officer be named in
the warrant. Kerans J.A., speaking for himself, McClung and Harradence JJ.A.,
held that the requirement of a named officer is to ensure there is some
specified person or persons responsible and accountable for the search. So long
as the search and seizures are carried out under the supervision and control of
the named officers the purpose of the requirement is met without undermining
the rule. Mere assistance by people not named in the warrant does not make the
search unlawful. See also R. v. Lebrocq (1984), 35 Alta. L.R. (2d) 184
(Alta. Q.B.)

 

27.                     It has even been said in one
case that only one officer should be named in the warrant; R. v. Baylis
(1986), 47 Sask. R. 15 (Sask. Q.B.) Diel­schneider J., faced with a warrant
that named thirty‑four members of the R.C.M.P. and one police service
dog, ""Rocky"", held that the inclusion of all the names was
unnecessary and unfortunate. This case was reversed on appeal on a different point.

 

28.                     A warrant issued under s.
10(2) of the Narcotic Control Act to search a dwelling place for
narcotics is significantly wider in scope than a normal search warrant issued
under s. 443  of the Criminal Code . For example, a narcotic search
warrant can be executed ""at any time,"" while a warrant under s. 443 
can normally be executed only during the day (s. 444). In addition, things
seized under a Criminal Code  warrant must be taken by the police officer
to a justice for disposition (s. 443(1) ), but there is no such requirement
under s. 10(2) . The requirement that the officer be named in the warrant to
search for narcotics, first enacted in s. 10(2) of the Narcotic Control Act,
S.C. 1960‑61, c. 35, is an important restriction that appears to have
been added to counterbalance the wider scope of a search warrant issued under
the section. There must be some person responsible for the way the search is
carried out.

 

29.                     This requirement is met when
the officer or officers named in the warrant execute it personally and are
responsible for the control and conduct of the search. The use of unnamed
assistants in the search does not violate the requirement of s. 10(2) so long
as they are closely supervised by the named officer or officers. It is the
named officers who must set out the general course of the search and direct the
conduct of any assistants. If the named officers are truly in control,
participate in the search, and are present throughout, then the use of
assistants does not invalidate the search or the warrant.

 

30.                     The concern of Dielschneider
J. in R. v. Baylis seems to have been that naming too many officers may
foster irresponsibility. The warrant should make it clear who is in charge of,
and responsible for, the search. Several courts have held that the naming
requirement is not met by a warrant directed to a particular set of peace
officers: R. v. Goodbaum (1977), 1 C.R. (3d) 152 (Ont. C.A.); Campbell
v. Clough (1979), 23 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 249 (P.E.I.S.C.); R. v.
Davidson (1982), 40 N.B.R. (2d) 702 (N.B.Q.B.T.D.); R. v. Newson
(1985), 41 Alta. L.R. (2d) 375 (Alta. Q.B.) Listing an entire drug squad by
name in a warrant may undermine the effectiveness of the naming requirement
just as much as a failure to name anyone at all.

 

31.                     The facts of this case
suggest that the requirement of s. 10(2) was met. Constable Bisceglia, one of
the named officers, appears to have been in charge of the search. The decision
when to execute the warrant was made by him, and he seems to have directed the
search procedure once the police were admitted to the apartment. The respondent
admits that the two unnamed officers found some of the materials seized and may
have touched them, but they were taken into possession by the named officers
who had the direction of the search. The validity of the search should not
depend on the minor details of the actual physical process of execution. The
important point is that the search was conducted under the close control and
supervision of two officers named in the warrant.

 

32.                     The facts of this case do
not suggest that s. 8  of the Charter  was breached. In Hunter v.
Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, the Court established the importance of
advance authorization for searches by an impartial official capable of acting
judicially. Faced with a suspect who was about to leave town and the loss of
two of the named officers, Constable Bisceglia telephoned the justice for
permission to substitute two other officers. Even if the substitution was not
authorized by the Narcotic Control Act, Constable Bisceglia showed
respect for the spirit of s. 8  of the Charter  and awareness of the
limitations on police search powers. The search warrant was validly issued and
validly executed.

 

 

                           VI

 

Section 10 (b)
and the Right to Counsel

 

33.                     The respondent has conceded
in this Court and in the Court of Appeal, that the police violated the
appellant's right to counsel when they refused to allow him to telephone a
lawyer until after he was taken to the police station. Because of that
concession, it is not necessary to consider the violation of the right to
counsel in depth in this case, but it is nevertheless opportune to comment on
one aspect.

 

34.                     The trial judge rejected the
argument that Constable Bisceglia needed to get the situation ""under
control"" before allowing any telephone calls and held that the violation
of the right to counsel occurred as soon as the Constable refused to let the
appellant telephone his lawyer. Esson J.A. disagreed with the trial judge on this
point and held that Constable Bisceglia's concern to stabilize the situation
was a proper one. Although it is not necessary to decide the point in this
case, I would be inclined to agree with Esson J.A. The combination of an arrest
in the accused's home, the presence of two unknown people, and the knowledge
that two restricted weapons were in the apartment, was a potentially volatile
situation. It is true the accused had the proper registration permits for the
weapons, but, notwithstanding, the possibility of their use was a serious
matter for a police officer to consider while taking a person into custody. In
my opinion, Constable Bisceglia was justified in preventing any new factors
from entering the situation until some of the unknowns had been clarified. Thus
I would say that the violation of s. 10 (b) did not occur when Constable
Bisceglia initially prevented the appellant from telephoning his counsel. But
once the accused had been arrested, the weapons located, and the other two
people had left, the police were clearly in control and there was no reason why
they should not have allowed the appellant to telephone a lawyer. I would hold
that the denial of counsel began from that point.

 

                          VII

 

Section 24 and the
Exclusion of Evidence

 

35.                     Counsel for the Crown
submitted that the narcotics should not be excluded under s. 24(2) . The
respondent advanced two arguments for this submission. First, the Crown
contended that there was no direct relationship between the breach of the accused's
right to counsel and the discovery of the drugs. Absent a causal connection,
the evidence could not be said to have been obtained in a manner that infringed
the Charter , and therefore s. 24(2)  could not be invoked to exclude the
evidence in question. Second, and in the alternative, the respondent submitted
that on the test enunciated in R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, for
exclusion under s. 24(2) , the evidence ought not to be excluded. I will
consider each of these arguments in turn.

 

A.      Was
the Evidence Obtained in a Manner that Infringed the Charter?

 

36.                     The respondent's first
argument rests on a restrictive interpretation of the scope of s. 24(2) .
Section 24(2)  is a special remedial provision. It is set apart from s. 24(1) ,
the general remedial section of the Charter . Section 24(2)  sets out the
conditions in which the exclusion of evidence may be granted in an application
for a remedy under s. 24(1) . In R. v. Therens and R. v. Collins,
majorities of the Court held that s. 24(2)  provides the sole basis for the
exclusion of evidence; evidence cannot be excluded under s. 24(1)  alone. The
wording of s. 24(2)  suggests that two conditions must be met before evidence
will be excluded: (i) the evidence must be ""obtained in a manner that
infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed"" by the Charter 
and (ii) the admission of the evidence in the proceedings ""would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute"". In Crown counsel's submission,
there must be a causal connection between the Charter  breach and the
evidence sought to be excluded. Evidence does not clear the first hurdle in s.
24(2)  unless it is the product of, or derived from the exploitation of, a Charter 
violation.

 

37.                     This Court has discussed the
meaning of the phrase ""obtained in a manner that infringed or denied
rights and freedoms guaranteed by this Charter "" on only one
occasion. In R. v. Therens, Le Dain and Lamer JJ. each considered the
first requirement of s. 24(2) . Le Dain J., speaking for himself and McIntyre J.
in dissent, suggested that the first branch of s. 24(2)  generally requires only
a temporal connection. He rejected a more stringent interpretation calling for
a causal connection between the Charter  violation and the discovery of
the evidence (at p. 649):

 

        In my opinion the words ""obtained in a
manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this
Charter "" particularly when they are read with the French version, obtenus
dans des conditions qui portent atteinte aux droits ou libertés garantis par la
présente charte, do not connote or require a relationship of causation. It
is sufficient if the infringement or denial of the right or freedom has
preceded, or occurred in the course of, the obtaining of the evidence. It is
not necessary to establish that the evidence would not have been obtained but
for the violation of the Charter . Such a view gives adequate recognition
to the intrinsic harm that is caused by a violation of a Charter  right
or freedom, apart from its bearing on the obtaining of evidence. I recognize,
however, that in the case of derivative evidence, which is not what is in issue
here, some consideration may have to be given in particular cases to the
question of relative remoteness.

 

Lamer J. disagreed
with the view that a temporal link is sufficient for the purposes of the first
branch of s. 24(2) . He was of the view that there must be some additional nexus
between the Charter  violation and the evidence but, he did not elaborate
on what this requirement might be. Justice Estey, speaking for himself and
Beetz, Chouinard and Wilson JJ., did not address the question but applied s.
24(2)  to exclude breathalyser readings taken in violation of the accused's
right to counsel.

 

38.                     In the present appeal, Esson
J.A. rejected the Crown's submission that s. 24(2)  requires a causal link
between the Charter  infringement and the discovery of the evidence. He
considered R. v. Therens and held that it did not stand for the
proposition that s. 24(2)  requires a causal nexus. In his view the language of
s. 24(2)  militated against such an interpretation. If present, a causal link
was one factor to take into account in the later s. 24(2)  determination whether
admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute. Esson J.A. concluded that the evidence was obtained in a manner that
infringed the Charter .

 

39.                     I am inclined to agree with
Esson J.A. and to reject the approach to the first requirement of s. 24(2) 
advanced by the Crown. In my view, reading the phrase ""obtained in a
manner"" as imposing a causation requirement creates a host of
difficulties. A strict causal nexus would place the courts in the position of
having to speculate whether the evidence would have been discovered had the Charter 
violation not occurred. Speculation on what might have happened is a highly
artificial task. Isolating the events that caused the evidence to be discovered
from those that did not is an exercise in sophistry. Events are complex and
dynamic. It will never be possible to state with certainty what would have
taken place had a Charter  violation not occurred. Speculation of this
sort is not, in my view, an appropriate inquiry for the courts.

 

40.                     A causation requirement also
leads to a narrow view of the relationship between a Charter  violation
and the discovery of evidence. Requiring a causal link will tend to distort the
analysis of the conduct that led to the discovery of evidence. The inquiry will
tend to focus narrowly on the actions most directly responsible for the
discovery of evidence rather than on the entire course of events leading to its
discovery. This will almost inevitably lead to an intellectual endeavour
essentially amounting to ""splitting hairs"" between conduct that
violated the Charter  and that which did not.

 

41.                     An illustration of this
problem may be drawn from the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal
in R. v. Cohen (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 156. The facts of that case are
very similar to those of R. v. Collins. The accused was under
surveillance for possession of cocaine by the R.C.M.P. Drug Squad. As the
accused left an apartment building and approached her car, an R.C.M.P. officer
grabbed her and placed a choke hold on her throat. The choke hold revealed
nothing. A female R.C.M.P. officer then frisked the accused and searched her
purse. Several packets of cocaine were discovered inside the accused's purse.
Defence counsel conceded that there were reasonable and probable grounds for
believing that the accused was in possession of cocaine. The Crown conceded
that the choke hold was unreasonable, the R.C.M.P. officer having testified
that persons generally do not carry cocaine in the mouth.

 

42.                     The majority (Taggart and
Craig JJ.A.) of the British Columbia Court of Appeal held that the cocaine was
not obtained as a result of an unreasonable search. The majority drew a
distinction between the choke hold which was unreasonable, and the subsequent
frisk of the accused's person and search of her purse which did not violate s.
8 . In reaching this conclusion, the majority adopted a strict causal approach
to the actions that culminated in the discovery of the cocaine. They did not
consider the drugs found in the accused's purse tainted in any way by the
earlier choke hold. Anderson J.A. in dissent rejected this approach. He
regarded as narrow and technical the Crown's contention that the drugs could
only be excluded under s. 24(2)  if they had been found as a direct result of
choking the accused. Such an interpretation, Anderson J.A. suggested, would
render almost nugatory the purposes sought to be achieved by the inclusion of
s. 24(2)  in the Charter . I agree with Anderson J.A. that the approach of
the majority is overly narrow. In my view, directing the initial inquiry in s.
24(2)  to the existence of a causal connection between the Charter 
violation and the evidence whose exclusion is sought will encourage this type
of restrictive approach to the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter .

 

43.                     Imposing a causation
requirement in s. 24(2)  would generally have the effect of excluding from
consideration under that section much of the real evidence obtained following a
violation of the right to counsel. Violations of the right to counsel may
frequently occur in the course of a valid arrest or, as in the present appeal,
in the execution of a valid search power. In these situations, real evidence
discovered on the person of the accused or in the course of the search will
not, subject to one exception, have a direct causal relationship with the
denial of the right to counsel. Derivative evidence, obtained as a direct
result of a statement or other indication made by the accused, is the only type
of real evidence that may be said to be causally connected to violations of the
right to counsel in these situations. With the exception of derivative
evidence, infringements of the right to counsel occurring in the course of
arrest or execution of a search warrant, can only be causally connected to self‑incriminating
evidence. R. v. Manninen, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1233, is a case in point. A
strict causal requirement would tend to preclude real evidence discovered after
a violation of s. 10 (b) from being considered under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .

 

44.                     In situations other than
valid arrest or reasonable execution of a search warrant, it may be possible to
argue that the presence of counsel might have prevented the discovery of real
evidence. This could be the case, for example, under the personal search
provisions of the Customs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑40, considered in
R. v. Simmons, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 495, or under the provisions of the new Customs
Act, S.C. 1986, c. 1. These provisions permit a person about to be searched
to request a second authorization before the search is conducted. Persons who
are not given the opportunity to consult counsel in this situation may be
unaware of their right to request a second opinion and the search may proceed
without further authorization. It would be possible to argue that had the
person been informed of the right to counsel, counsel would have advised the
person to demand a second opinion and this might have been that a search should
not be conducted. Imposing a causal requirement would result in treating
violations of s. 10 (b) differently depending on the role counsel could
have performed and would invite idle speculation on what might have happened if
the accused had exercised the right to counsel.

 

45.                     In my view, it is not useful
to create a requirement in the first stage of s. 24(2)  that would separate
violations of s. 10 (b) into two categories based on the role of counsel.
Nor is it fruitful to read into the first stage a condition that would limit
the scope of s. 24(2)  to self‑incriminating or derivative evidence for
certain s. 10 (b) violations. Ordinarily only a few Charter 
rights, ss. 8 , 9  and 10 , will be relevant to the gathering of evidence and
therefore to the remedy of exclusion under s. 24(2) . So long as a violation of
one of these rights precedes the discovery of evidence, for the purposes of the
first stage of s. 24(2)  it makes little sense to draw distinctions based on the
circumstances surrounding the violation or the type of evidence recovered. A
better approach, in my view, would be to consider all evidence gathered following
a violation of a Charter  right, including the right to counsel, as
within the scope of s. 24(2) .

 

46.                     In my view, all of the
pitfalls of causation may be avoided by adopting an approach that focuses on
the entire chain of events during which the Charter  violation occurred
and the evidence was obtained. Accordingly, the first inquiry under s. 24(2) 
would be to determine whether a Charter  violation occurred in the course
of obtaining the evidence. A temporal link between the infringement of the Charter 
and the discovery of the evidence figures prominently in this assessment,
particularly where the Charter  violation and the discovery of the
evidence occur in the course of a single transaction. The presence of a
temporal connection is not, however, determinative. Situations will arise where
evidence, though obtained following the breach of a Charter  right, will
be too remote from the violation to be ""obtained in a manner"" that
infringed the Charter . In my view, these situations should be dealt with
on a case by case basis. There can be no hard and fast rule for determining
when evidence obtained following the infringement of a Charter  right
becomes too remote.

 

47.                     If a Charter 
violation has occurred in the course of obtaining the evidence, the analysis
will proceed to the second, and in my view the more important, branch of s.
24(2) , whether the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute. In R. v. Collins, the Court articulated a
comprehensive test for the second branch of s. 24(2) . Lamer J. for the
majority, identified three groups of factors to be considered in the course of
this inquiry. The first group concerns the fairness of the trial. The nature of
the evidence, whether it is real evidence or self‑incriminating evidence
produced by the accused, will be relevant to this determination. The second
group relates to the seriousness of the Charter  violation. Consideration
will focus on the relative seriousness of the violation, whether the violation
was committed in good faith or was of a merely technical nature or whether it
was willful, deliberate and flagrant, whether the violation was motivated by
circumstances of urgency or necessity, and whether other investigatory
techniques that would not have infringed the Charter  were available. The
final set of factors relates to the disrepute that would arise from exclusion
of the evidence. In my view, the three groups of factors encompass aspects of
the relationship between the Charter  violation and the evidence at
issue, thereby permitting some examination of the relationship in the course of
the core inquiry under s. 24(2) . The presence of a causal link will be a factor
for consideration under the second branch of s. 24(2) .

 

48.                     I conclude that the
narcotics in this appeal were obtained in a manner that infringed the Charter .
During the execution of a search of his apartment, the appellant was denied his
right to consult counsel. Marijuana was discovered during the course of the
search. In my view, this chain of events is sufficient to clear the first
branch of s. 24(2) . I therefore turn to consider the second branch, whether
admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.

 

B.      Would
the Admission of the Evidence Bring the Administration of Justice into
Disrepute?

 

49.                     On the basis of the test in R.
v. Collins, I am of the view that the evidence should not be excluded under
s. 24(2) . The factors concerning the fairness of the trial are especially
important when the right to counsel has been violated because of the concern
that an accused has been incriminated by statements improperly elicited by the
police. Unlike Clarkson v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 383, and R. v.
Manninen, supra, where the breach of the right to counsel resulted
in self‑incriminatory statements, no such statements were elicited in
this case. Admission of the narcotics themselves would not render the trial
unfair.

 

50.                     The second set of factors
focusing on the seriousness of the Charter  breach would also not
militate towards exclusion of the evidence. The denial of the right to counsel
does not appear to have been part of a larger pattern of disregard for Charter 
rights. The police did not, as in R. v. Manninen, goad the accused into
talking, nor did they hold him incommunicado for over six hours. The initial
reason for the denial of counsel was the desire to stabilize an uncertain
situation involving two unknown individuals, two restricted weapons, and an
arrest for drug offences in a person's own home. Initially, this was a valid
concern. The police erred in not allowing the accused to call a lawyer once the
position was stable. The error seems to have been an isolated error of
judgment, however, rather than a conscious determination to take advantage of
the accused before allowing him to speak to counsel. The police seem to have
assumed that they could finish the search before taking the accused to the
station where he could telephone a lawyer. They were wrong to assume the
routine search took priority over the accused's right to counsel, but the
motive seems to have been convenience rather than a desire to trap the accused
into talking.

 

51.                     Constable Bisceglia's
earlier conduct over the search warrant is an important factor to consider in
judging the overall situation. When faced with a sudden change in circumstances
and the possibility that the suspect would leave town, he took the time to telephone
the justice for permission to substitute the two people on the warrant. That is
not the action of a police officer likely to ignore or shortchange Charter 
rights. It is the careful action of a police officer aware of the limitations
on his authority who appreciated the need for prior permission for searches.
While Constable Bisceglia erred later in his denial of counsel to the accused,
that denial of counsel does not appear to have been part of a pattern of abuse
of Charter  rights.

 

52.                     The final group of factors
relates to the effects of exclusion on the administration of justice. Routine
exclusion of evidence necessary to substantiate charges may itself bring the
administration of justice into disrepute. Any denial of a Charter  right
is serious, but s. 24(2)  is not an automatic exclusionary rule. Not every
breach of the right to counsel will result in the exclusion of evidence. In
this case where the breach of the right to counsel was inadvertent and where
there was no mistreatment of the accused, exclusion of the evidence rather than
its admission would tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.
I am therefore of the view that the evidence of the marijuana ought not to have
been excluded at trial.

 

                          VIII

 

Conclusion

 

53.                     The search in this case did
not breach the requirements of s. 10(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. It
was not unreasonable under s. 8  of the Charter . There was a denial of
the accused's right to counsel under s. 10 (b) of the Charter , but
the evidence should not be excluded under s. 24(2)  as its admission would not
bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

 

54.                     The appeal should be
dismissed and the order of the Court of Appeal for a new trial should be
upheld.

 

        The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

55.                     Lamer
J.‑‑I concur in the reasons of the Chief Justice. Because of
what I said in R. v. Therens, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 613, I should like to add
brief comments to what the Chief Justice has said as regards when
""evidence is obtained in a manner that infringed the Charter "".

 

56.                     With the benefit of
hindsight and the observations of the Chief Justice, I am now satisfied that
the approach proposed by Le Dain J. in R. v. Therens is, from a
practical point of view, the better one. The requirement for some
""nexus"", as I suggested, would be too difficult a test to apply.

 

        The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

57.                     Wilson
J.‑‑I have had the benefit of reading the Chief Justice's
reasons for judgment and although I am in agreement with his disposition of the
appeal I differ in some of my reasoning.

 

58.                     With respect, I cannot
accept the Chief Justice's conclusion that the appellant's right to counsel
under s. 10 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  was
not violated until after the appellant had been arrested, the weapons located,
and the other two people in the dwelling‑house had left.

 

59.                     Section 10 (b) of the Charter 
reads:

 

        10. Every one has the right on arrest or
detention

 

                          ...

 

(b) to retain and instruct counsel without
delay and to be informed of that right;

 

The right to
retain and instruct counsel without delay is available ""on arrest or
detention"". In this case the appellant was arrested once Constable
Bisceglia entered the dwelling‑house to conduct the search. It was at
that time that the appellant was read the standard police warning including the
right to counsel guaranteed under the Charter . Not surprisingly, it was
at that time that the appellant demonstrated his desire to exercise his
constitutional right by picking up the telephone and stating that he was going
to call his lawyer.

 

60.                     Although it is also
understandable that the police, upon entry into the dwelling‑house with
knowledge that restricted weapons were located on the premises, would desire,
in their words, to get ""matters under control"", I do not think that
this allows them to deny the appellant his constitutional right to retain and
instruct counsel ""without delay"". This seems to me to be reading a
qualification or limit into s. 10 (b) which is simply not there. It is to
read the phrase ""without delay"" as ""without unreasonable
delay"". Section 1  of the Charter  is the sole source of reasonable
limits and they must be ""prescribed by law"", not imposed by the
police in their discretion: see R. v. Therens, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 613, at
p. 621.

 

61.                     The danger in reading
internal limits or qualifications into the plain language and clear purpose of
s. 10 (b) can be readily seen in this case. After the appellant was
arrested and denied his right to contact his lawyer, Constable Bisceglia
proceeded to question him about his use of drugs. This kind of questioning
which involves an attempt to acquire incriminating evidence in the absence of
counsel is, with respect, the very mischief that s. 10 (b) was designed
to prevent: see R. v. Therens, supra; Clarkson v. The Queen,
[1986] 1 S.C.R. 383; and R. v. Manninen, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1233.

 

62.                     It apparently took
approximately forty minutes for the police to get matters under control. This
may very well have been necessary given the particular circumstances of this
case, but is this a norm that the courts are free to substitute for the
constitutional standard of ""without delay""? Surely not. I think that
the implication of variable limits into s. 10 (b) depending on an
assessment of what may be required for the police to obtain control in any particular
fact situation is a slippery slope which not only removes all certainty as to
the citizen's rights under s. 10 (b) but is completely inconsistent with
its plain words and purpose. I agree with the Chief Justice that the
appellant's right to counsel was violated but I believe that the violation
occurred when, upon the appellant's arrest, he was denied the right to
telephone his lawyer.

 

63.                     If I am right in this, what
is the effect of the violation of the appellant's right to counsel on the
search of the appellant's premises? I agree with the Chief Justice that the
search warrant was validly issued. No question arises in this case as to
whether the law authorizing the search is reasonable. It clearly is. As the
Chief Justice concludes, the search warrant was authorized in advance of the
search by an impartial official capable of acting judicially. That does not,
however, in my view conclude the inquiry as to whether the requirements of s. 8 
have been met.

 

64.                     As I discussed in R. v.
Simmons, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 495, and R. v. Jacoy, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 548,
I do not believe that a search which is conducted in face of a violation of the
citizen's Charter  rights can be a reasonable search under s. 8 . There is
nothing in the legislation authorizing the issuance of search warrants which
expressly or by necessary implication or by the operating requirements of the
legislation overrides the citizen's s. 10 (b) rights: see R. v.
Therens, supra. There is nothing in the circumstances of this case
to suggest that there was an urgent reason for the police to proceed with their
investigation and attempt to obtain evidence before according the appellant his
right to communicate with his counsel: see R. v. Clarkson, supra,
at p. 397; R. v. Manninen, supra, at p. 1242. Accordingly, the
search which was proceeded with in violation of the appellant's s. 10 (b)
rights was unconstitutional.

 

65.                     As will be apparent from the
above, it is my view that the appellant's right to counsel was violated from
the time that, having been informed that he was under arrest and had the right
to counsel, he was denied the use of the telephone to call his lawyer. As in R.
v. Simmons, supra, and R. v. Jacoy, supra, this
violation of the right to counsel made the search per se
unconstitutional and, accordingly, unreasonable.

 

66.                     The constitutional right to
retain and instruct counsel without delay is, without question, an extremely
important right in the administration of criminal justice. It is not surprising
that it is guaranteed to persons without qualification upon detention and
arrest. To my mind a continuing denial of that constitutional right during an
otherwise reasonable search must prima facie render the manner in
which the search was conducted unreasonable. Given the constable's explanation
as to why he denied the appellant access to the telephone, I cannot accept that
the situation was one of such urgency so as to justify the continued denial of
the right to counsel. Permitting the appellant to telephone his lawyer would
not have interfered with the police officer's efforts to locate the restricted
weapons and get ""matters under control"". This is not to say, however,
that there may not be situations in which the police for their own safety have
to act in the heat of the moment to subdue the suspect and may be excused for
not pausing to advise the suspect of his rights and permit him to exercise
them, but this is not one of those cases. It would be unfortunate indeed if the
exception were to become the rule and one of the fundamental rights of the
citizen was to be so easily gainsaid.

 

67.                     I agree with the Chief
Justice for the reasons given by him that the admission of the evidence in this
case would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

of appeal for british columbia

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Defences ‑‑ Entrapment ‑‑ Meeting between undercover
agent and accused set up by friend of accused ‑‑ Whether or not
accused entrapped.

 

                   Appellant was convicted of
drug trafficking as a result of a sale of marijuana made to an undercover
police officer in March 1982. On a voir dire the appellant testified
that he had been entrapped into committing the crime because of the pressure
exerted on him by a friend. This friend, in exchange for consideration by the
police with respect to his own narcotics charge, had agreed to assist the
police. He made several telephone calls to appellant to arrange for the
undercover agent to meet with appellant and ultimately brought about a meeting
between the two. The trial judge rejected the appellant's claim of entrapment.
The Court of Appeal dismissed appellant's appeal.

 

                   Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   None of the circumstances
identified as factors leading to a conclusion that the police conduct went
beyond acceptable limits existed here. The police acted on reasonable suspicion
and were fully entitled to provide appellant with an opportunity to commit the
offence. They did not use tactics that would induce the average person into the
commission of an offence. The use of undercover agents and informers is common
and necessary because drug trafficking is especially difficult. Appellant's
friendship was neither exploited nor violated in setting up the meeting with
the undercover agent. The number of telephone calls made by appellant's friend
to bring about the meeting was not significant, given the general appeal to
profit in the calls, the short number of days involved, and the fact that the
average narcotic supplier is not going to respond at the very first phone call.

Introduction

 

2.                       The
appellant was charged with unlawfully trafficking in a narcotic contrary to the
provisions of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1. The
charge arose as a result of a sale of marijuana made to an undercover police
officer on March 18, 1982. He was convicted of this offence by Judge Catliff of
the County Court of Vancouver, sitting with a jury. On a voir dire the
appellant testified that he had been entrapped into committing the crime
because of the pressure exerted on him by a friend, Ward Kirkus. The trial
judge rejected the appellant's claim and the jury returned a verdict of guilty.
The appellant appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal and in reasons
for judgment given by MacFarlane J., concurred in by Carrothers and Aikins
JJ.A., the appeal was dismissed. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court and
the appeal was heard at the same time as the appeal in R. v. Mack,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 903. I am of the view that this appeal must be dismissed.

 

The Facts

 

3.                       The
Crown called two witnesses on the voir dire, Constable Hickman and
Constable Adam, and the appellant testified on his own behalf. Constable Hickman
testified that Ward Kirkus, the alleged entrapper, was facing a potential
narcotics charge and it was agreed that the police would give him some
consideration with respect to his charge in exchange for Kirkus' assisting the
police. Constable Hickman had information, received from Kirkus and others,
that the appellant was a supplier of narcotics. Constable Hickman instructed
Kirkus to phone the appellant for the purpose of arranging a sale of narcotics.
Following a discussion with Kirkus, Constable Hickman directed an undercover
officer, Constable Adam, to go to a mall parking lot on March 15, 1982,
approach a person sitting in a specific vehicle, and ask if he could purchase
some drugs. Adam was provided with approximately $200 to that end. The person
in the car was in fact Kirkus. Constable Hickman had told Kirkus that a man
would approach him in his car. Neither Constable Adam nor Kirkus were informed
of the fact they were both working for the police, in accordance with standard
police procedure. It is clear, however, that Constable Adam suspected Kirkus
was acting on behalf of the police upon meeting him at the mall. At all
material times Constable Hickman was assisting in the surveillance of this
undercover investigation of the appellant.

 

4.                       There
were three narcotics transactions arising from the association set up by Kirkus
between the appellant and the undercover Constable Adam, only the second of
which the appellant was charged.

 

5.                       On
March 15, 1982, Constable Adam met Kirkus and Kirkus drove him to the
appellant's house. Kirkus introduced Constable Adam to the appellant. Constable
Adam testified that Kirkus asked the appellant if he had any narcotics and the
appellant, who had been told by Kirkus that a half‑pound of marijuana
would be purchased, stated that he was ""doing pounds for $1,900.""
Constable Adam testified that he told the appellant he could not afford to buy
a half‑pound at that time and it was arranged that the appellant and the
officer meet again on March 18. At some point during the discussion Constable
Adam picked up a plastic bag containing approximately half an ounce of
marijuana. Constable Adam inquired as to the amount and price and the appellant
sold this package to Constable Adam at that time. The appellant was not charged
with any offence as a result of this transaction.

 

6.                       As
arranged, the appellant met with Constable Adam on March 18 and while driving
in his car the appellant pulled out a bag containing three individually
packaged half‑pounds of marijuana. The two men discussed prices and Adam
had the appellant stop so that Adam could obtain an additional $100 needed to
buy one of the half‑pounds. At this time the appellant, upon being asked
by Constable Adam, indicated that he could supply cocaine, ""red hair""
(marijuana) and he stated that he had been dealing for years and was lucky to
find some really good sources. The agreed to transaction was then completed.

 

7.                       Constable
Adam testified that he phoned the appellant on April 13, and the appellant
phoned him the next day, and the two met on the 15th. Constable Adam gave
evidence that a further drug transaction was set up and the appellant took him
to the residence of a Scott Muirhead. The appellant introduced them and then
left. A transaction involving five pounds of marijuana was concluded between
Muirhead and the undercover officer. The appellant was not charged with respect
to this sale although Muirhead was.

 

8.                       The
appellant testified that he and Wade Kirkus were friends and they had known
each other for approximately seven years. He had not heard from him for about
six months when he received a phone call on March 6, 1982. Kirkus told him he
had a friend who was interested in buying marijuana and who was willing to pay
a ""lot of money"". The appellant says he told Kirkus he was not really
interested and, while he may know someone, he was not willing to get involved.

 

9.                       The
next day Kirkus called and repeated his request. The appellant again said he
was not interested and he asked Kirkus how much money was involved. Kirkus told
him that his friend was willing to buy ten to fifteen pounds. The appellant
says he told Kirkus ""you are talking to the wrong guy"". Kirkus then
asked for about a half‑pound. The appellant agreed to ask around for him
and told Kirkus to phone him back.

 

10.                     The
appellant asked a friend but that person did not want to deal with Kirkus. When
Kirkus phoned back, he said he was unable to assist him. Then Kirkus asked if
the appellant could please help him out ""just this once"". The
appellant then asked about Kirkus' friend and Kirkus again stressed the profit
they would both make and the appellant said he would have to think about it.
Similar conversations initiated by Kirkus occurred the next two nights and
Kirkus emphasized that his friend might be getting impatient. The appellant
suggested that he meet Kirkus' friend and if he thought he was ""okay""
he would try and arrange a meeting between his friend and the undercover
officer.

 

11.                     The
next day Kirkus phoned twice to see whether the appellant had made the
arrangements and the appellant said he was too busy and unable to reach his
friend and he agreed to check the next day. That following day Kirkus phoned
and the appellant said he still had not reached his friend. Kirkus asked how
long it would take and the appellant told him to call back in an hour. When
Kirkus called, the appellant told him he could bring the officer to the
appellant's home on Monday, March 15. Kirkus said his friend, Constable Adam,
had approximately $1,000 to spend.

 

12.                     The
appellant gave evidence that he had never sold marijuana to anyone before and
he made the following statement when asked what was going on in his mind as the
phone calls from Kirkus continued:

 

 

...A:   He was calling
me every day. He would talk to me, and I told him I didn't think so, and I
didn't know, and I would check it, and I started telling him I would call him
back, and I never did. I never checked it, and finally it just got to be a bit
of a problem, him calling me every day.

 

Q:      Why weren't you
checking it?

 

...A:   Because I wasn't
interested in doing it.

 

Q:      And what did you
think would happen?

 

...A:   I thought he
would maybe find someone else to deal with and he might stop calling me. I was
hoping that he would work it out himself.

 

13.                     Then
the appellant contacted Scott Muirhead who supplied him with three separately
wrapped half‑pounds of marijuana. The appellant did not pay for them but
arranged to share the proceeds with Muirhead with the appellant earning $250 on
the sale of one half‑pound. The appellant explained why he had two extra
half‑pounds in the following manner:

 

Well, Scott gave me more than one‑half pound, and I asked him why
he was giving me more, and he told me, well, maybe the guy will like it and
take more. It would just be more money for you, you are doing it now, so, you
know, a few more dollars for you would be even better. I just‑‑I
didn't say‑‑I couldn't say no. He just asked if there was a problem
and I told him, no, I guess not.

 

14.                     The
appellant was asked why he sold the half‑pound on the 18th, following the
first meeting with Constable Adam. He stated:

 

Well, there is a various number of reasons. It was a combination of
reasons, I guess. Ward [Kirkus] was a very good friend of mine at the time. He
was persistently calling me, and the money was a factor. I just couldn't say no
to a friend, who really wanted me to help him out. He sounded, not desperate,
but almost desperate to the point where, you know, you've got to help me out
just this once. So, his persistence, or his constant calling didn't stop, so I
really didn't have the will to say no to a friend. So, I did it just the once.

 

15.                     The
appellant insisted that the reason why he acted as if he knew about drugs and
sources in his interactions with Constable Adam was because Muirhead told him
to ""talk big"" and to appear like a drug dealer so as to impress the
Constable and that he just did what Muirhead told him to do. In cross‑examination,
the following exchange took place which provides a useful summary of the
appellant's position:

 

 

 

Q:      So, to sum up,
you really got talked into this, is that what you are saying, by Kirkus and
Muirhead?

 

...A:   Well, I was
beginning‑‑it was beginning to be a problem with them calling me
all the time, you know. He was a friend. He sounded like he needed help, and it
was a one‑shot deal, so I did it for a friend, a good friend.

 

Q:      But you got $250
out of it?

 

...A:   I did get some
money for it, yes. That wasn't the main reason, though.

 

Decisions of the Courts Below

 

16.                     Catliff
Co. Ct. J. ruled that the Crown bore the onus of proving the absence of
entrapment beyond a reasonable doubt and concluded: ""in this case there is
no evidence that satisfies me of entrapment, and further, that the Crown has
proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was not entrapped into
committing this offence"". The trial judge accepted the testimony of the
appellant that the calls between him and Kirkus took place, and that he was
initially hesitant and told Kirkus he ""had the wrong guy"" when Kirkus
asked about a sale of ten to fifteen pounds of marijuana.

 

17.                     Catliff
Co. Ct. J. noted that the appellant had plenty of chances to avoid committing
the offence. He refused to give credit to the appellant's argument that he did
it because of an obligation to a friend. Catliff Co. Ct. J. characterized this
as a submission which ""amounts almost to saying he was entrapped by
friendship"". The appellant was not, in the words of Ritchie J. in Amato
v. The Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 418, at p. 473, the subject of ""police
tactics [which] are such as to leave no room for the formation of independent
criminal intent"".

 

18.                     Catliff
Co. Ct. J. then referred to the passage from the opinion of Estey, J. in Amato,
supra, at p. 446, where Estey, J. stated that the offence must be
""instigated, originated or brought about by the police and the accused
must be ensnared into the commission of that offence by the police
conduct"". He concluded that the facts did not, ""by any stretch of the
imagination"", support the existence of this requirement. He referred to
the appellant's demonstrated familiarity with drugs and then made the following
statement respecting the conversation between the appellant and the undercover
officer at the time of the sale on March 18:

 

I would say that from taking that conversation at face value, there was
a predisposition on his part to commit the offence. The accused says he was
only boasting, and had been told by his friend, Scott, to act as though he were
a drug dealer. I discount that, and do not accept that explanation. I see no
reason why on earth, if the accused was feeling obliged out of the pressures of
friendship to sell drugs to Adam, that he would feel the need to boast falsely
in the way that he did.

 

19.                     Other
circumstances noted by the judge as showing that the appellant was not ensnared
were the fact that the appellant had brought additional drugs with a view to
sell if the occasion arose, and the fact that he arranged to meet Constable
Adam in his apartment, and having met him, came to an independent decision to
sell him drugs.

 

20.                     MacFarlane
J.A. on behalf of the Court of Appeal confirmed the decision of that Court in R.
v. Mack (1985), 49 C.R. (3d) 169, to the effect that: (a) entrapment is
available as a defence, but only as an aspect of abuse of process; (b) the
issue of entrapment is a question of law for the judge alone; and (c) the
accused has the onus of establishing entrapment on a balance of probabilities.

 

21.                     The
Court was of the view that although the trial judge erred with respect to the
onus and standard of proof, that error was favourable to the appellant, and an
application of the proper approach would not have produced a different result.
MacFarlane J.A. also held there was evidence to support the trial judge's
findings of fact and these facts did not justify a conclusion that there was
entrapment. He concluded that the appellant had not established entrapment on a
balance of probabilities and, therefore, dismissed the appeal.

 

Analysis

 

22.                     In
Mack, supra, I outlined the proper approach to the doctrine of
entrapment. I agree with the Court of Appeal in the present case that had the
trial judge correctly applied the onus and standard of proof, the result would
be the same. The appellant has not demonstrated that the conduct of the police,
viewed objectively, constitutes entrapment.

 

23.                     Firstly,
it is clear that the police acted on reasonable suspicion and they were fully
entitled to provide the appellant with an opportunity to commit the offence.
The issue is, therefore: ""have the police gone further than providing an
opportunity and instead employed tactics designed to induce someone into the
commission of an offence?"" (Mack, supra, at p. 959).

 

24.                     The
offence of drug trafficking is, as was noted in Mack, supra, one
which is especially difficult to detect and the use of undercover agents and informers
‑‑ like Kirkus in the present case ‑‑ is common and
necessary. There has been no exploitation of a close personal relationship
between Kirkus and the appellant. If the police were unable to rely on the
existing connections and associations between people in the narcotics business
they would be unduly hampered in their efforts at detecting crime and
preventing further criminal activity. Certainly there was an appeal to the
appellant because of his friendship with Kirkus but it was not unduly exploitive
and nor was the dignity of their relationship violated. This alone is not
sufficient to establish the defence in the absence of any other factors.

 

25.                     The
number of phone calls made by Kirkus occurred over a very short time span and
as described by the appellant himself, consist generally of appeals to the
profit they could each make by getting involved. Obviously the average narcotic
supplier is not going to respond at the very first phone call and it would not
be unusual for there to be a number of contacts made before a deal is arranged.
I do not, therefore, find the fact that Kirkus had to phone the appellant a
number of times to be significant especially given the content of these calls
and the short number of days involved. I have no doubt that the average person
would not be induced into the commission of an offence as a result of this
conduct.

 

26.                     In
short, there are none of the circumstances which existed in Mack, supra,
or which have been identified in that judgment as factors which may lead to a
conclusion that the police conduct has gone beyond the limits that our society
deems proper. I would, therefore, dismiss this appeal.

on appeal
from the court of appeal for ontario

 

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Mens rea ‑‑ Specific and general intent ‑‑ Drunkenness ‑‑
Breaking, entering and committing indictable offence ‑‑ Whether or
not evidence of self‑induced intoxication should be considered in
determining whether mens rea proved beyond a reasonable doubt ‑‑
Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, s. 306(1)(b).

 

                   Appellant was charged with and
acquitted of breaking and entering and committing the indictable offence of
assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 306(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code . There was considerable evidence that he had been quite drunk when he
broke into complainant's apartment and assaulted her and that he was acting
very much out of character. The only defence advanced was lack of intent due to
appellant's voluntary consumption of alcohol. At trial, the offence charged was
held to be one requiring proof of a specific intent and consequently the
evidence of self‑induced intoxication was considered. The Court of Appeal
overturned the acquittal on appeal and entered a conviction. At issue was
whether or not the ""defence"" of drunkenness was available.

 

                   Held (Dickson C.J. and Lamer and La Forest JJ.
dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per Beetz and McIntyre JJ.: The charge against the
appellant, which was framed under s. 306(1) (b) of the Criminal Code ,
is one of general intent to which the defence of drunkenness does not apply.

 

                   Per Wilson and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ.: The offence
of breaking and entering and committing the indictable offence of assault
causing bodily harm under s. 306(1) (b) of the Criminal Code  is an
offence of general intent. The evidence of drunkenness was not such as to be
capable of negating the minimal intent required under s. 306(1) (b) or of
raising a reasonable doubt. The rule in Leary should have been applied.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and Lamer and La Forest JJ.
(dissenting): The distinction between specific and general intent should be
abandoned and evidence of self‑induced intoxication should be taken into
account where relevant to the issue of intent. The trial judge heard and
correctly considered evidence of self‑induced intoxication and concluded
in the light of all the evidence that there was a reasonable doubt as to the
accused's intent to commit the offence.

(dissenting)‑‑This appeal has been brought to the Court on a single
question of law, namely:

 

Did the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario, err in law in

appellant, Mark Edward Quin, on the charge alleged in the information before
the learned Provincial Judge?

Facts

 

3.                       The
complainant had ended her relationship with the appellant. He was very fond of
her and was upset. He went drinking with a friend. They drank heavily. Shortly
after midnight, on the morning of October 27, 1982, the appellant broke into
the complainant's apartment and assaulted her. Later, he slashed his own
throat. He and the complainant were treated for relatively minor injuries and
released from hospital. The appellant was thereupon charged with the offence
which is the subject of this appeal, causing bodily harm, contrary to s.
306(1)(b) of the Code. While certain factual details are in
issue, there was no dispute that the appellant did break into the complainant's
home and did assault her.

 

4.                       The
only defence advanced was lack of intent due to the appellant's voluntary
consumption of alcohol. There was considerable evidence from both Crown and
defence witnesses that the appellant was very drunk and acting very much out of
character when he broke the window on the front door, unlocked it and forced
his way into the apartment. The appellant testified he had not eaten all day,
he had slept little in the previous four days, and he had consumed a great deal
of alcohol between 8:00 p.m. on October 26th and 12:30 a.m. on October 27th.
The defence also led expert psychiatric evidence to establish the effect of the
appellant's consumption of alcohol on his mental processes considering the
amount he had imbibed, his lack of sleep, and failure to eat that day.

 

                           II

 

Judgments in the Ontario
Courts

 

5.                       The
Provincial Court Judge referred in his reasons to the decision of the Ontario
Court of Appeal in R. v. Campbell (1974), 17 C.C.C. (2d) 320, where it
was held that the offence of breaking and entering with intent to commit an
indictable offence was an offence requiring proof of a specific intent and
concluded therefore that evidence of self‑induced intoxication could be
considered. The judge held that in light of all the evidence, including that of
self‑induced intoxication, there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the
accused had the intention to commit the offence. Quin was acquitted.

 

6.                       The
Crown appealed the acquittal of Quin and the Ontario Court of Appeal (MacKinnon
A.C.J.O., Martin and Zuber JJ.A.) reversed the acquittal and entered a
conviction: see (1983), 9 C.C.C. (3d) 94. The Court held that Campbell
was not governing as the charge there fell under s. 306(1) (a) and not
306(1)(b) as in the instant case.

 

7.                       Section
306(1)  of the Criminal Code  reads:

 

        306. (1) Every one who

 

(a) breaks and enters a place with intent to commit
an indictable offence therein,

 

(b) breaks and enters a place and commits an
indictable offence therein, or

 

(c) breaks out of a place after

 

(i) committing an indictable offence therein, or

 

(ii) entering the place with intent to commit an indictable
offence therein,

 

is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable

 

(d) to imprisonment for life, if the offence is committed
in relation to a dwelling‑house, or

 

(e) to imprisonment for fourteen years, if the offence is
committed in relation to a place other than a dwelling‑house. [Emphasis
added.]

 

8.                       The
court stated that ""It is common ground that drunkenness, depending upon
the evidence, is a defence to crimes of specific intent"". Section 306(1) (a)
deals with charges of breaking and entering a place with intent to commit
an indictable offence therein, and has been held to create a crime of specific
intent. The charge here, however, is under s. 306(1) (b), which involves
breaking and entering and committing an indictable offence. The court
continued at p. 96:

 

It was not strenuously argued by counsel for the respondent that the
offence of assault causing bodily harm was not a crime of basic or general
intent: D.P.P. v. Majewski, [1977] A.C. 443; R. v. Janvier
(1979), 11 C.R. (3d) 399. If the offence alleged to have been committed inside
the building after the break and enter is one of specific intent, which does
not contain an included offence of general intent, then the offence of
drunkenness is available in respect of that offence and consequently the charge
in such cases would not be made out. It is equally clear that the defence of
self‑induced intoxication negativing the requisite criminal intent is not
available to charges of crimes of general intent. R. v. George (1960),
128 C.C.C. 287, [1960] S.C.R. 87, 34 C.R. 1; Leary v. The Queen (1977),
33 C.C.C. (2d) 473, 74 D.L.R. (3d) 103, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 29. This being so the
defence of intoxication was not available to the defendant in the instant case,
and that position affects the entire charge, namely, break and enter and
committing the indictable offence of assault causing bodily harm. The acquittal
therefore must be set aside and a conviction registered.

 

                          III

 

Disposition

 

9.                       In
R. v. Bernard, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 833, I have indicated that the
distinction between specific and general intent should be abandoned and that in
all cases, evidence of self‑induced intoxication should be taken into
account where relevant to the issue of intent.

 

10.                     I
would, therefore, in the case at bar, adopt the reasons in Bernard,
allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal and
restore the verdict of acquittal. The trial judge heard the evidence and
correctly considered evidence of self‑induced intoxication and concluded
in the light of all the evidence that there was a reasonable doubt as to the
accused's intent to commit the offence.

 

        The judgment of Beetz
and McIntyre JJ. was delivered by

 

 

 

11.                     McIntyre J.‑‑The
facts and issues arising in this case have been adequately set out in the
reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice. The charge against the appellant was
framed under s. 306(1) (b) of the Criminal Code  and, as the Court
of Appeal found, is one of general intent to which the defence of drunkenness
does not apply: see R. v. George, [1960] S.C.R. 871, and Leary v. The
Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 29. For the reasons which I have expressed in R.
v. Bernard, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 833, I would dismiss the appeal.

 

        The judgment of
Wilson and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ. was delivered by

 

 

12.                     Wilson J.‑‑I
have had the benefit of the reasons of the Chief Justice and of my colleague,
Justice McIntyre. I agree with McIntyre J. for the reasons given by him that
the offence of breaking and entering and committing the indictable offence of
assault causing bodily harm under s. 306(1) (b) of the Criminal Code  is
an offence of general intent.

 

13.                     The
facts of this case are set out in the reasons of the Chief Justice. I would add
only that, according to the agreed statement of facts, the appellant had
telephoned the complainant at 10:30 p.m. on the evening in question,
subsequently made his way to the house in which she lived and, upon his
arrival, broke the window on the front door and unlocked it and forced his way
into her apartment. He then assaulted her, throttled her, verbally abused her
and struck her on the head with a beer bottle. The appellant admitted forcing
his way into the apartment and pushing the complainant against the wall and
sliding to the floor on top of her. As in R. v. Bernard, [1988] 2 S.C.R.
833, we are dealing with a case of intentional application of force.

 

14.                     Although,
as the Chief Justice notes, there was considerable evidence from both the
appellant himself and from an expert witness that the appellant was ""very
drunk and acting very much out of character"", there was no evidence of
such extreme intoxication as to negate an aware state of mind as in the case of
insanity or automatism. Accordingly, the rule in Leary v. The Queen,
[1978] 1 S.C.R. 29, should, in my view, have been applied by the trial judge.

 

15.                     The
Chief Justice in his reasons points out that the trial judge concluded in light
of all the evidence, including that of voluntary intoxication, that there was a
reasonable doubt as to the accused's intent to commit the offence. The trial
judge, in my view, and for the reasons given by the Ontario Court of Appeal
(1983), 9 C.C.C. (3d) 94, misdirected himself as to the minimal requirements of
s. 306(1) (b) of the Criminal Code . He proceeded in fact as if the
appellant had been charged under s. 306(1) (a). As the Court of
Appeal noted at pp. 95‑96:

 

        The provincial judge was of the view that the judgment of this
Court in R. v. Campbell (1974), 17 C.C.C. (2d) 320, was determinative of
the issue whether drunkenness was a defence to the offence charged. However, as
pointed out by Mr. Doherty, the charge in R. v. Campbell, supra,
concerned a charge under s. 306(1)(a) of the Code not s. 306(1) (b)
as in the instant case. Section 306(1) (a) deals with charges of breaking
and entering a place with intent to commit an indictable offence
therein, creating crimes of specific intent in all cases under the subsection.
It is common ground that drunkenness, depending upon the evidence, is a defence
to crimes of specific intent. The charge here covers break and enter and
committing the offence of assault causing bodily harm.

 

16.                     I
would agree with the Chief Justice's reasoning and result if the appellant had
been charged with the specific intent offence under s. 306(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code . He was, however, charged with the general intent offence under s.
306(1) (b). Since the evidence was not such as to be capable of negating
the minimal intent required under s. 306(1) (b), I would dismiss the
appeal.
