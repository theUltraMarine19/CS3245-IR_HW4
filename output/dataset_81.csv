This is an appeal by the appellant against a sentence passed on him under s 43(3) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (`the Act`) on his conviction of an offence of driving a car while subject to disqualification.
The facts are that on 10 September 1990 at about 7.40am a car driven by the appellant along Jurong West Street 42 was stopped and checked by the traffic police. On being required to produce his driving licence, the appellant failed to do so. The appellant did not have a driving licence at the time, for reasons that will appear later. Subsequent investigation disclosed that the car belonged to a member of his family. The insurance policy contained the usual condition that it was valid only if the car was driven by a licensed driver.
The appellant was charged under s 43(3) of the Act for driving while under disqualification, and was also charged under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189) for driving a car while there was not in force the required policy of insurance in respect of third party risks.
The appellant pleaded guilty to the charges. On the first charge, he was sentenced to one week`s imprisonment and a fine of $500, and was also disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licence for a period of three years. On the second charge, he was sentenced to a fine of $500 and disqualified from holding or obtaining a class 3 driving licence for a period of 12 months. The disqualifications were to run concurrently. The appellant, being dissatisfied with the sentence on the first charge, has appealed to this court. He has paid the fines in respect of both charges and has been granted bail pending his appeal.
Section 43(3) of the Act reads: 
 
If any person who under the provisions of this Act is disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence applies for or obtains a driving licence while he is so disqualified or if any such person while he is so disqualified drives a motor vehicle, or if the disqualification is limited to the driving of a motor vehicle of a particular class or description a motor vehicle of that class or description, on a road, that person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction - 
(a) to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months; 
(b) (if the court thinks that having regard to the special circumstances of the case it is not necessary to impose a sentence of imprisonment for the offence) to a fine not exceeding $1,000; or 
(c) to both,
 
 
 
and a driving licence obtained by any person disqualified as aforesaid shall be of no effect.
 
 
 
Section 42 of the Act provides for disqualification for offences as follows: 
 
 
(1) Any court before which a person is convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle may, in any case except where otherwise expressly provided by this Act and shall, where so required by this Act, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court thinks fit: 
 
Provided that if the court thinks fit, any disqualification imposed under this section may be limited to the driving of a motor vehicle of the same class or description as the motor vehicle in relation to which the offence was committed. 
 
(2) A person who by virtue of an order of court is disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence may appeal against the order in the same manner as against the conviction, and the court may if it thinks fit, pending the appeal, suspend the operation of the order.
  
 
 
The learned magistrate, in his grounds of decision, noted that the appellant admitted to a long list of antecedents. In particular, the appellant had been sentenced to one week`s imprisonment and a fine of $300 for driving while under disqualification as recently as 24 July 1990 and had also been disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licence for a period of two years. This was less than two months before his present offence. The learned magistrate was of the view that the appellant clearly showed a contempt for court orders, committing the same offence again so soon after he had been disqualified for two years. The learned magistrate took into account counsel`s plea in mitigation that the accused was married with two children aged seven and five years old, was supporting his aged mother, and was presently under probation as a supervisor. He noted that much was made of the fact that the appellant had been suffering since 1987 from diabetes mellitus which required daily medication and that on the day of the offence, the appellant claimed that he was driving to a pharmacy to purchase insulin for his medical condition. However, the three medical reports which had been tendered to substantiate the appellant`s claim of his medical condition had been issued in December 1991 and January 1992, some considetime after the offence had been committed on 10 September 1990. The appellant had made no attempt to show that he was in dire need of insulin on the day of the offence; neither had he shown that he could not have taken a taxi to the pharmacy or had somebody else in his family drive him there.
From a perusal of the appellant`s antecedents, the learned magistrate noted that since 1982 he had been convicted of driving without a valid licence and without insurance on nine previous occasions, and on five of these occasions he had also been driving while under disqualification. Nevertheless, keeping in mind the appellant`s guilty plea, his medical condition and mitigation plea, he sentenced him to only one week`s imprisonment and a fine of $500 and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licence for a period of three years.
The appellant has appealed against the sentence on the ground that the sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances. Essentially, his counsel has submitted in this appeal that the learned magistrate failed to give due consideration to his mitigation plea; in particular, that, because of his medical condition, the appellant was, at the time of the offence, under extreme stress and in a state of panic which rendered him incapable of thinking and acting rationally, and resulted in his breaching the order of court. This is very much a rehash of the mitigation plea which was urged on the learned magistrate, and I have no hesitation in rejecting it.
Driving while under disqualification is a serious offence. A person who cannot be trusted with driving a motor vehicle and who yet does so prejudices the safety of other road users. Such an individual must not expect to be treated lightly when he has posed a danger to others by assuming a trust for which he is not fit. Additionally, this leads to a situation in which the motor vehicle is no longer covered by a policy of insurance against third party risks. If the car meets with an accident resulting from the negligence of the driver, the insurance company will not be liable to pay compensation for any damage or injury caused to a third party. Unless special circumstances of the case can be shown within the meaning of the term in s 43(3)(b) of the Act, magistrates should no longer hesitate to impose a substantial sentence of imprisonment. That being so, a sentence of one week`s imprisonment and a fine of $500, together with a disqualification for three years, cannot by any stretch of imagination be considered to be manifestly excessive. In fact, as I shall explain in a moment, the sentence in this particular case was much too light, and I am surprised that the appellant has not been dissuaded by his solicitors from an unwise appeal.
In this particular case, I note from the list of antecedents in the appeal record that between July 1982 and his present offence on 10 September 1990, the appellant had been convicted on nine separate occasions for driving without a licence and without insurance, and had already been disqualified from driving for varying periods on each of these occasions, in July 1982, July 1983, June 1984, March 1985, August 1985, July 1986, January 1989, February 1990 and July 1990. When he committed the present offence on 10 September 1990, there were three overlapping disqualifications which had not expired, the last of which had been ordered less than two months earlier. In my opinion, this is clearly a case in which, at the hearing of an appeal, the court should exercise its powers under s 256 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) to enhance the sentence. Accordingly I set aside the previous sentence under s 43(3) and substitute therefor a sentence of imprisonment of six months and a fine of $1,000 or, in default, a further three months. I also order under s 42 of the Act that he be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life.
The enhancement of sentence which I have ordered this morning is the maximum which is possible under the present law. From his record of offences in the last ten years, it would appear to me that even a disqualification for life is not necessarily going to inhibit a confirmed offender like the appellant from committing the offence again after his release from prison. This is a problem which cannot be resolved by the courts, as the punishment which a court can impose for offences under s 43 of the Act is no longer adequate in the circumstances of today. The problem requires urgent attention by the law-making authorities.
