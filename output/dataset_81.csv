     REGINA v Donny ITAMUA  
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1    SHELLER JA: I agree with Smart AJ. 
     
      
    2    DOWD J: The applicant, having pleaded guilty on 15 October 1998, was sentenced on 5 March 1999 by Viney QC DCJ, in the Penrith District Court. 
     
      
    3    The applicant was charged and pleaded guilty to forty-two charges of robbery armed with a dangerous weapon, contrary to s97(2)(ii) of the Crimes Act 1900 (‘the Act’). This offence carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. The applicant was also charged with one count of assault with intent to rob whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, contrary to s97(2) of the Act, which similarly carries a maximum of twenty-five years imprisonment, and had taken into account a Form 1 offence of possessing a loaded firearm in a public place contrary to s93G(1)(a)(i) of the Act, which carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4    The offences occurred over a relatively short period of time, from early December 1997 to April of 1998. The applicant was sentenced on the fourteenth charge, taking into account the offence under Form 1, to a minimum term of twelve years penal servitude commencing on 5 April 1998, being the date that he went into custody, and to expire on 4 April 2010. He was sentenced to an additional term of six years, to commence on 5 April 2010 and to expire on 4 April 2016. 
     
      
    5    On each of the remaining charges, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of three years penal servitude, to commence on 5 April 1998 and to expire on 4 April 2001, the latter sentences to be served concurrently with the offence for which he received twelve years. 
     
      
    6    I have read the judgment in draft form of Smart AJ, and would agree with the summary of facts and the reasons outlined in his Honour’s judgment, except for the issue of totality as set out below. I would only add a few additional facts. 
     
      
    7    In respect of paragraph 8(f), concerning the Royal Hotel, Granville, I would add that on 6 April 1998, a co-accused, Tovio Antonio, surrendered himself to Fairfield Police Station, where he fully admitted to his involvement in the offence. Antonio implicated the applicant as being the person in the hotel with him, and in carrying the firearm. The description that was given by witnesses is consistent with that of the applicant, and the additional inquiries confirmed an association between the applicant and Crichton.  
     
      
    8     In relation to paragraph 8(h), regarding the Belfield RSL Club, I could only add the following. On 6 April 1998, a co-accused, Tovio Antonio, surrendered to police, and fully admitted his involvement in the offence. He implicated the applicant as being involved, and stated that the applicant was armed with a sawn off rifle. Additional inquiries confirmed the association of the applicant and Antonio on the morning of the offence. The applicant however, refused to comment on the offence. 
     
      
    9    Finally, in relation to paragraph 8(i) concerning the Fairfield Hotel, I would note additionally that the applicant later admitted to being the person at the door, and admitted that he was armed with a pistol. 
     
      
    10    Before turning to the matters concerning the application of the principles of Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, as set out from paragraph 10 onwards of His Honour’s judgment, I wish to set out and deal with the applicant’s grounds of appeal. The applicant submits that the sentence imposed by the Sentencing Judge was manifestly excessive, and that the learned Judge fell into error by:1) Placing too much weight on the need for general deterrence, in relation to Mr Itamua. 
     
      
       
         
       
      
    2) Placing insufficient weight on the applicant’s plea at the earliest possible occasion. 
     
      
       
         
       
      
    3) Placing insufficient weight on the applicant’s subjective feature, including: 
     
      
       
         
       
      
    · His relatively young age at the time of the offences (21); 
     
      
       
        
         
          
            
          
         
        
       
      
    · His prior good character and reputation; 
     
      
       
        
         
          
            
          
         
        
       
      
    · His excellent prospects of rehabilitation; 
     
      
       
        
         
          
            
          
         
        
       
      
    · His contrition and remorse. 
     
      
       
        
         
          
            
          
         
        
       
      
    4) Placing insufficient weight on the applicant’s assistance to the police. 
     
      
       
         
       
      
    5) In assessing the overall criminality, the Sentencing Judge placed too much weight of the subjective features of count 14. 
     
      
       
      
    11    I would make the following remarks as to each of those grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    12    General Deterrence 
     
      
      The gist of the applicant’s first ground of appeal is that the trial judge fell into appellable error in placing too much weight on the need for general deterrence in relation to the applicant.  
       
      
    13    I find, however, that this ground of appeal misstates what the trial judge in fact said as to deterrence. At page 3 of his remarks on sentence, Viney QC DCJ stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The situation these days, with armed robberies, is quite appalling in this State. They are committed with such regularity that the courts and the community, through their Parliamentary representatives, have, from time to time, expressed concern that not enough is being done by the courts to adequately punish these sorts of offences. It goes without saying that the victims are put in peril, in fear, and go through traumatic experiences at the hands of bandits who come into premises, such as in this case, late at night, armed with dangerous weapons, and to threaten and, at times, inflict harm on these people, take the money and the personal possessions of the victims, and put them in considerable fear and concern. No doubt, in many case, that fear and concern will last for a long time. 
         
        It seems to me, whatever sympathy one might have for Mr Itamua, the balance of consideration is that there has to be adequate punishment, for one reason to reflect the community’s attitude to this sort of offence, and, secondly, of course, to act as a deterrent to Mr Itamua, and equally to act as a deterrent to other people who might think that they commit these sorts of offences, and not receive the full weight of punishment that the law requires”. 
        
       
      
    14    As indicated in Broxam (Unreported, NSWCCA, 3 April 1980, Slattery CJ at CL, Reynolds and Carruthers JJ), there were some thirty or so victims of the armed robbery. These offences were obviously part of a larger overall planned series of offences. There is no question that there is a need to deter this type of offence: see Bavadra [2000] NSWCCA 292.  
     
      
    15    The decision in R v Henry & Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 436, dealing with less serious offences, indicated a clear need for deterrent penalties. Clearly, His Honour intended the penalty imposed in respect of charge fourteen to reflect the totality of the offences involved, as well as in terms of overall criminality and deterrence.  
     
      
    16    I do not consider that this ground of appeal is made out.  
     
      
    17    Plea at Earliest Opportunity  
     
      
      The second ground of appeal is that His Honour arguably placed insufficient weight on the applicant’s plea at the earliest opportunity. This matter was recognised by His Honour, but there is a limit to the weight which can be given in relation to the seriousness of the offence. The last offence was in circumstances where it was difficult for the applicant not to have been convicted.  
       
      
    18    It must be remembered that the penalty imposed, although reflecting the totality of all the offences, was in respect of the penalty which carried a twenty-five year maximum. His Honour was obliged to reflect carefully on the premeditation and planning, the use of guns, in particular that being loaded when the applicant was arrested. Added to that was the fact that the offences were carried out in company. Corporeal violence was inflicted on more than one victim, and the seriousness of the offence limited the extent to which the applicant’s early plea could be given weight. 
     
      
    19    I do not consider that this ground of appeal is made out.  
     
      
    20    Subjective Features  
     
      
      The applicant further submitted that His Honour placed insufficient weight on the applicant’s subjective features in assessing sentence. 
       
      
    21    It is clear from the application of s5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989, that His Honour was conscious of the excellent prospects of rehabilitation and the youth of the applicant, and in setting the sentence, took these matters into account. 
     
      
    22    Remorse would have been better shown by a greater level of co-operation. It is clear that the applicant was selective in the information which he gave to the police, and refused to provide information clearly within his knowledge which may have considerably assisted other convictions or arrests of co-offenders. 
     
      
    23    I do not consider that this ground of appeal is made out. 
     
      
    24    Applicant’s Assistance  
     
      
      The next ground of appeal was that His Honour placed insufficient weight on the applicant’s assistance. At several points during the record of interview, the applicant failed to assist in the identification of co-offenders, as I have referred to in the previous ground. It is clear also that the applicant, in respect of at least one offence, did not disclose his full contribution, nor did he assist in the location of the weapons. On one occasion, the applicant also declined to answer questions. At page 2 of his remarks on sentence, His Honour commented that the applicant was “co-operative with the police in disclosing the part he played and, on some occasions, naming some of the others involved, although he declined to name others”. 
       
      
    25    His Honour further commented that none of the main players in the offences were identified in what was a substantial scheme involving several other persons. There is limited assistance which could have been given in the light of the limited assistance provided by the applicant. This would have obliged His Honour to place as much weight as a full disclosure would have entitled the applicant. It is for this reason that each of the grounds of appeal, in my view, fail. 
     
      
    26    The sentence was high when examined as against the Judicial Commission’s statistics, but there is little information to compare the nature of these offences in these proceedings, and it is unlikely that the statistics reflect such a consistent pattern of serious criminality. 
     
      
    27    I would not grant leave to the applicant to appeal on this ground. 
     
      
    28    Overall Criminality as to Count 14 
     
      
      I have read the remarks of Smart AJ in paragraphs 10 to the end of his judgment, with which remarks I agree, except for the matter set out below. I also agree with the proposed orders.  
       
      
    29    I consider that there is a degree of artificiality in proposing to accumulate the new sentence on charge 14 on an existing three year fixed sentence on one of the other charges. I consider however, that there is, in any assessment of totality, a degree of artificiality, where a judge has to apply the totality principle where there are existing sentences, and a new sentence has to be fixed to reflect the principle of totality, taking existing sentences into account. I therefore concur in the proposed sentencing. 
     
      
    30    The matter in respect of which I do not agree with Smart AJ, relates to His Honour’s remarks in paragraph 15 in relation to Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 and Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 623-4. Mill and Pearce were decided before it was possible both to pass a sentence that was part concurrent and part cumulative. This latter course is demonstrated in the decision of this Court in R v Bavadra [2000] NSWCCA 292. 
     
      
    31    The use of partial accumulation and partial concurrence is now a preferred course. But in my view, the principle established in Pearce related to transparency and the desirability in fixing terms in respect of each offence. Pearce specifically referred to the principle of totality as it then existed, but did not purport to change that principle. It is, in my view, still open to a sentencing judge, within the proper sentencing range, to enlarge a sentence to reflect the totality of criminality in assessing a period of criminality over a number of offences. This is similar, although not precisely the same, to the exercise which a sentencing officer carries out when taking into account the offences on a Form 1 (see R v Bavadra [2000] NSWCCA 292) to enlarge a sentence. 
     
      
    32    As I have indicated, I otherwise agree with the remarks of His Honour and the proposed orders.  
     
      
    33    SMART AJ: Donny Itamua seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence of the District Court (Judge Viney) comprising a minimum term of twelve years imprisonment and an additional term of six years imprisonment imposed on Count 14. This was one of forty two offences of robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon which the applicant admitted that he committed between 8 December 1997 and 5 April 1998. There was a further admitted offence of assault with intent to rob whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. On all counts except count 14 the applicant was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of three years to commence on 5 April 1998, the date of commencement of the sentence on count 14. On that count the judge took into account the further offence of possessing a loaded firearm in a public place. 
     
      
    34    At the hearing before this Court there was a dispute as to the subject matter of Count 14. However, this is made clear by the judge’s endorsement on the Committal for Sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Convicted on all counts 
        
       
       
        
        Charge H478669/15 (robbery whilst armed with dangerous weapon at Auburn on 14.1.98) sentenced to a minimum term of 12 years penal servitude to commence 5.4.98 and expire 4.4.2010 together with an additional term of 6 years to commence 5.4.2010 and expire 4.4.2016…” 
        
       
       
      Charge H 478669/15 reads: 
       
       
        
        “That Donny Itamua on the 14th day of January 1998 at Auburn … being then armed with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a long barrelled handgun, a semi automatic pistol and a baseball bat did rob M- M- of certain property, to wit a man’s wallet, $300 in cash, one 18ct gold chain …the property of the said M- M-.” 
        
       
      
    35    This corresponds with count 14 on the Schedule of Offences handed to the judge at the sentence hearing. The judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I propose to impose a sentence in respect of matter number 14 which, on the face of it, seems to be one of the most serious of the offences, individually, and reflect in that sentence the total criminality. Although the offences occurred over a period of some months, it could be said they were one episode of criminality … I do not think it is appropriate, given the length of sentence I propose to impose, to have cumulative sentences. On the other matters there will be fixed terms.” 
        
       
      
    36    It will be necessary to look at count 14 and the overall position. 
     
      
       
      Count 14 
       
      
    37    About 1.50 am on 14 January 1998 up to five offenders entered the Auburn Village Tavern armed with a long barrelled handgun, a semi automatic pistol, a baseball bat and a club lock. All five men wore balaclavas or other disguises. One was a big man. He announced that this was a robbery, that they were serious and would shoot. Three of the men ordered everyone to the backroom. One man was hit in the ribs with the baseball bat and another on the face. Three of the men tied the hands of the patrons behind their backs. MM was tied around his hands and ankles and hit on the right side of the head with the bat. The barman was grabbed by the hair. The manager was taken away. Three of the men went around each patron on the floor taking their wallets and jewellery. One took MM’s wallet and tore his gold chain from his right wrist. A few minutes later the manager was brought back and sank to the floor. The man with the baseball bat said to the manager that he had not opened the safe downstairs but the manager asserted that he had. The man with the baseball bat threatened to blow the manager’s head off. The manager said that they should take him downstairs. He got up and went with that man and later returned. One of the men hit MM with a club-lock. MM was aged 17. 
     
      
    38    As the robbers left one of them stated “Don’t go near the doors for the next fifteen minutes or we will blow your heads off. Don’t try to be a hero.” 
     
      
    39    In his recorded interview of 5 April 1998 the appellant said that he was involved as a driver, driving the men to the Tavern. He did not go inside the Tavern. He appeared to be aware that wallets were taken from patrons at the Tavern but unaware that there had been any physical violence. He knew that when he drove the men to the Tavern they were going to commit an armed robbery and that when he went back to the house they would have money from the armed robbery. When they returned to David’s house after the armed robbery they gave him money, being part of the moneys taken during that armed robbery. 
     
      
    40    In his further recorded interview of 7 April 1998 the appellant confirmed that there were at least five people involved in the armed robbery of the Auburn Village Tavern. The appellant said that he was involved in driving some of the men to the Tavern. He had become aware about an hour prior to that the men were going to commit an armed robbery. He had earlier driven the men to David Lipani’s house, the robbery headquarters which were a short distance from the Tavern. After dropping the men off at the Tavern he went back to that house. 
     
      
       
       
      Overall Position 
       
       
      (a)  
      Auburn Village Tavern 
       - Seven other people were the subjects of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon and six were subjected to broadly similar treatment. One of those people, namely, the Night Manager of the Tavern, was subjected to even worse treatment. He was coerced by the armed robbers into opening up various places where money was kept and helping them to take the Tavern’s money. He was subjected to dire threats including death threats if he failed to co-operate. About $20,000 of the Tavern’s money was stolen. He also had his wallet, $175 cash, personal papers and cards taken. 
       
       
      (b)  
      The Palms Hotel, Chullora 
       - 8 December 1997 
       
       
      Four males forced their way into the hotel about midnight. Weapons included a handgun and a baseball bat. The victims were bound with tape and the keys taken from the manager. The offenders took $20,000 of the hotel’s money. Five individuals in the hotel were also the victims of an armed robbery. In his recorded interview the appellant admitted being involved in the planning and preparation of the offences. He was aware that an armed robbery was to be committed by his associates and took them to the vicinity of the hotel for that purpose. He drove his brother’s car and waited in the car during the armed robberies. He drove the co-accused from the hotel knowing they had committed an armed robbery and later that morning received part of the proceeds from the offences. 
       
       
      (c)  
      Lucky L’ils Hotel, Parramatta 
       - 19 January 1998 
       
       
      The appellant who was in possession of a pistol attended the hotel with an unknown co-accused. The appellant was not wearing a balaclava. Four staff within the hotel were threatened and three of these staff members were tied up with plastic ties. The Assistant Manager was forced to open two safes. About $20,500 in cash belonging to the hotel was taken. Four individuals were also the victims of an armed robbery. 
       
       
       
      (d)  
      Rosehill Hotel 
       - 2 February 1998 
       
       
      About 12.10 pm the appellant drove his brother’s vehicle with two accomplices to the vicinity of the Rosehill Hotel. The co-accused entered the hotel both armed with handguns and threatened the staff and patrons. Money was taken from the cash register. The Manager was forced to open a safe and cash of $11,959 was stolen. Patrons were forced to lie on the ground. The accomplices left the hotel and returned to the vehicle driven by the appellant which left the scene. The appellant admitted being involved in the planning and preparation of the offence; he was aware that an armed robbery was to be committed by his associates. He drove the co-accused from the hotel knowing that they had committed an armed robbery and received part of the proceeds from the offence. 
       
       
      (e)  
      The Mekong Club, Cabramatta 
       - 11 February 1998 
       
       
      Shortly after midnight two co-offenders entered the Club with their faces covered, one of them being armed with a handgun. Staff and patrons inside the Club were forced to lie on the floor in the Manager’s office. The Manager was forced to open the safe and money was stolen. Cash drawers about the Club were also ransacked and money was stolen from these drawers. About $44,000 in cash of the Club was taken. Three individuals were also the victims of threats and armed robberies. The appellant drove his brother’s vehicle to the vicinity of the offence and went inside the Club to confirm that there were not too many staff members thus making it a “low risk” job. After canvassing the Club the appellant returned to the car and informed the two co-offenders of his observations. The appellant waited in the car during the offences. He drove the co-offenders from the Club knowing that they had committed an armed robbery and later that morning received part of the proceeds from the offences.

      Royal Hotel, Granville 
       - 20 February 1998 
       
       
      The appellant and a co-offender, by arrangement with the hotel doorman, entered the hotel which was closed. One of the offenders was armed with a semi-automatic handgun. At the time staff were counting the takings; threats were made and eventually $6,000 was stolen from the hotel. One individual was also the victim of an armed robbery. The available evidence was that it was the appellant who was the offender who entered the hotel with a gun. While the appellant admitted that he was involved in the preparation and planning of the offence and sharing in the proceeds he denied that he entered the hotel with a gun. He refused to name the other offenders.

      About 4.00 am three offenders entered the hotel wearing balaclavas and armed with a semi-automatic handgun and a black aluminium baseball bat. Three staff members were threatened, two of them being immediately forced to the floor and being tied with cable ties. The Manager was forced to open a safe from which $21,000 was stolen. He was also tied with cable ties. Two individuals were also victims of the armed robbery. The appellant admitted to being involved in the planning and preparation of the offences, being aware that an armed robbery was to be committed by his associates, taking them in a vehicle to the vicinity of the hotel for that purpose and driving them from the hotel knowing that they had committed an armed robbery. The appellant received part of the proceeds from the offence.

      On 16 March 1998 the appellant and a co-offender gained access to the club, the appellant being armed with a sawn off rifle. Both offenders were wearing balaclavas. Staff and cleaners were threatened and forced on to the floor. The Administration Officer was forced to open the safe from which $16,000 was removed by the offenders. One of the staff members was also the victim of an armed robbery.

       - 24 March 1998 
       
       
      The appellant pleaded guilty to an assault with intent to rob whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. A co-offender had attended at the hotel and surveyed it. The hotel’s security officer became suspicious and locked the doors of the Hotel. About 2.30 am the appellant wearing a balaclava and armed with a black handgun tried to force his way into the hotel through the doors. He pointed the handgun at the hotel security officer through a set of glass doors telling him that it was a holdup and for him to open the doors. The security officer refused and the appellant ran off.

      About 1.40 am three offenders with their faces covered entered the hotel with one of them being armed with an automatic handgun. Staff and patrons inside the hotel were threatened and forced to lie on the floor. A security officer was forced to open a register in the poker machine change area and approximately $5,566 was removed by the armed offender. Four victims in the hotel were also the subject of armed robberies. The appellant admitted to being involved in the planning and preparation of the offence, driving his brother’s vehicle and his associates to the vicinity of the hotel and being aware that an armed robbery was to be committed by them. He waited in the car during the offence and drove the co-accused from the hotel knowing that they had committed an armed robbery. Later he received part of the proceeds from the offences.

      About 9.50 pm an offender entered the hotel carrying a silver pistol with a long barrel and a metal table leg. He wore a balaclava. He ordered the staff and patrons on to the floor and tied the four of them up. Another three masked male offenders entered the hotel. One of these offenders was armed with a double barrelled shotgun. The hotel Manager was forced to open the hotel’s safe. An amount of $4744 was removed. The hotel Manager was again bound and forced to lie on the flor. The appellant was identified by fingerprints developed on the table leg used during the commission of the offence. The Manager, another hotel employee and two patrons were each the victim of an armed robbery. The property taken from the individuals consisted of cash and assorted jewellery to the value of $15,000.

      The appellant and three co-offenders entered the hotel about 1.35 am with the connivance of the security doorman. One co-offender who was armed with a black handgun threatened two victims. They were bound; one victim was made to open the hotel safe, whereupon $2,000 was removed. The appellant stated that he was the driver of his brother’s vehicle during the armed robbery.

      Sandringham Hotel - Newtown 
       - 5 April 1998 
       
       
      The charge is that being armed with dangerous weapon, the appellant attempted to rob persons unknown of certain property, to wit, certain property including cash monies the property of the Sandringham Hotel. The appellant was arrested about 12.20 am opposite the Sandringham Hotel where he was getting ready to rob the hotel. He was carrying a semi-automatic pistol. He was further charged with possessing a loaded firearm, which was loaded with ten rounds of ammunition, in a public place, namely, the footpath of King Street, Newtown. 
       
      
    41    Thus, it can be seen that the appellant attended at thirteen hotels or clubs. In addition to the robbery of these, some thirty one individuals were the victims of an armed robbery. In some instances the evidence establishes that the appellant engaged in the preparations for the offence, driving co-offenders to the scene of the robbery knowing that a robbery was to take place, waiting for them, driving them away knowing a robbery had been committed and participating in the proceeds of the offence. In other instances the appellant’s involvement was even greater as he participated physically in the carrying out of the armed robberies in some of the hotels or clubs. The criminality revealed as to Count 14 was very high. It was also very high in other instances.  
     
      
    42    In Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 623-4, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “To an offender, the only relevant question may be ‘how long’, and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error. A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality. 
        
       
       
        
        Sentencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer arrived at by some process admitting of mathematical precision. It is, then, all the more important that proper principle be applied throughout the process. 
        
       
       
        
        Questions of cumulation and concurrence may well be affected by particular statutory rules. If, in fixing the appropriate sentence for each offence, proper principle is not applied, orders made for cumulation or concurrence will be made on an imperfect foundation. 
        
       
       
        
        Further, the need to ensure proper sentencing on each count is reinforced when it is recalled that a failure to do so may give rise to artificial claims of disparity between co-offenders or otherwise distort general sentencing practices in relation to particular offences.” 
        
       
      
    43    The course taken by the sentencing judge in the present case reflected the practice which existed in New South Wales prior to Pearce. Indeed, the Court of Criminal Appeal of this State had made it clear that on sentence appeals it was only concerned with the effective total of the sentences involved and not with the matter in which individual sentences were structured. That approach is no longer open. In Pearce at p 624 the High Court further said  
     
      
       
        
        “The appeal under s 5(1) of the 
          
        Criminal Appeal Act 
         1912 (NSW) being an appeal against ‘a sentence’, it was, of course, the individual sentences that fell for consideration, not just their overall effect. If the court ‘is of opinion that some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed, [it] shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor’” 
        
       
      
    44    The importance of the principle of totality was emphasised by the High Court in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 62-63. At p 63 the Court said as to totality: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Where the principle falls to be applied in relation to sentences of imprisonment imposed by a single sentencing court, an appropriate result may be achieved either by making sentences wholly or partially concurrent or by lowering the individual sentences below what would otherwise be appropriate in order to reflect the fact that a number of sentences are being imposed. Where practicable, the former is to be preferred.” 
        
       
      
    45    The approach taken in Pearce has special force where the major sentence has been imposed on one count and subsequently the conviction on that count has been quashed and either a verdict of acquittal entered or a new trial ordered. This brings into sharp focus the correctness of the sentences imposed on the other counts. 
     
      
    46    The problem faced by a sentencing judge becomes acute where there are a large number of offences being dealt with. In Fraser [2000] NSWCCA 97 at para 18 this Court held that where the offender has been sentenced for as many as twenty five offences the Court is not obliged to impose a series of separate sentences with separate commencement dates. The idea of imposing twenty five consecutive sentences each of a few months would be both impractical and verging on the absurd. The problems are usually best overcome by making the sentences concurrent or partially cumulative and partially concurrent or by making one group of sentences on a number of charges concurrent and another group of sentences on a number of other charges, those sentences being concurrent as between themselves, cumulative on the first group. This last mentioned course was permissible at the time the judge imposed his sentences.47    It is unnecessary to deal with the other grounds of appeal against sentence as the Court has to re-sentence to conform with Pearce. 
     
      
    48    The concurrent sentences for a fixed term of three years are in almost all instances manifestly inadequate having regard to the gravity of the offences. On the other hand, a sentence of eighteen years with a non-parole period of twelve years for one count of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon is, in the circumstances of this case, manifestly excessive, even allowing for the fact that it was a bad case. The judge in his reasons stated that he was reflecting the total criminality in the sentence he was imposing on Count 14. That is not an approach which Pearce and Mill permit. When the judge dealt with these sentences on 5 March 1999 he did not have the power to impose sentences that were partly concurrent and partly cumulative. That limitation has been overcome by s 55(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which commenced on 3 April 2000. 
     
      
    49    As earlier noted there has been no appeal by the appellant against the concurrent fixed term sentences of three years penal servitude. Nor has the Crown appealed against their inadequacy despite this being manifest. The question arises whether this Court if it considers that the judge has erred in his approach can alter the fixed term three year sentences on the ground that they were manifestly inadequate and that the overall sentence which remains after resentencing on Count No 14 does not adequately reflect the totality of the criminality. 
     
      
    50    In McL v The Queen (2000) 74 ALJR 1319 the High Court considered s 569(1) of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic). Section 7(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is to the same effect. That sub-section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “7(1) If it appears to the court that an appellant on an appeal under section 5(1), though not properly convicted on some count or part of the indictment, has been properly convicted on some other count or part of the indictment, the court may either affirm the sentence passed at the trial or pass such sentence whether more or less severe in substitution therefor as it thinks proper, and as may be warranted in law by the conviction on the count or part of the indictment on which it considers the appellant has been properly convicted.” 
        
       
      
    51    McL was convicted on numerous counts of sexual offences against his two step-daughters and sentenced to twelve years imprisonment with a non-parole period fixed at ten years. The Victorian Court of Appeal quashed four convictions but otherwise dismissed the appeal. This had the effect of reducing the total effective sentence of imprisonment to eight and a half years. However, the non-parole period remained at ten years. The High Court upheld the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal that the sentences imposed on the remaining counts were manifestly inadequate and it exercising its powers under s 569(1) of the Crimes Act (Vic) and re-sentencing the appellant on all remaining counts. The result was that the appellant received increased sentences on all the remaining counts with a total effective sentence of twelve years imprisonment and a non-parole period of ten years. Some of the sentences were concurrent and some were cumulative.  
     
      
    52    McL differs from the present case in that in McL there was an appeal against all convictions and four were quashed. There is no appeal against conviction in the present case. Section 7(1) depends upon there being an appeal against conviction and the appellant not being properly convicted on some count or part of the indictment but being properly convicted on some other count or part of the indictment. It is not directed to the case where there is no appeal against conviction but an application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    53    In the opening words of their judgment in McL Gleeson CJ, Gaudron & Callinan JJ at 1320 highlighted the limitations of s 569(1) of the Crimes Act 1968 (Vic), the counterpart of s 7(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) by stating that it gave power to the Court of Appeal “in a criminal appeal, in certain circumstances, to re-sentence an appellant who has been convicted of multiple offences and who successfully appeals against some of his convictions.” 
     
      
    54    Section 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that a person convicted on indictment may appeal with the leave of the Court against the sentence passed on the person’s conviction. Section 6(3) provides that on an appeal under s 5(1) against a sentence, the Court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal. Sections 5(1)(c) and s 6(3) do not empower this Court of its own motion or at the invitation of the Crown to intervene in respect of sentences in respect of which no appeal is brought by either the appellant or the Crown. There is no equivalent of s 7(1) where there is an appeal against sentence simpliciter. 
     
      
    55    The situation which exists is anomalous but there is no statutory provision which enables the Court to overcome it, where, as here, there is an excessive sentence on one count and inadequate sentences on all or most of the other counts. There is a pressing need for remedial legislation to cover this unfortunate gap. Regrettably, the Court is bound to proceed on the basis that it cannot disturb any of the current fixed term three year sentences. Pending any remedial legislation the Crown should give consideration, where there are multiple counts, to revising its traditional approach of looking at the overall sentence and not appealing if the overall sentence is within permissible limits even though some of the individual sentences are manifestly inadequate. Of course, this would only be necessary where there has been an application for leave to appeal against one or some of a number of sentences by an accused and the remaining sentences are manifestly inadequate. One of the problems which the Crown faces is that it does not know whether the application for leave to appeal by the accused and his appeal will be successful. Nevertheless, to protect the public interest the Crown may, in such a situation, need to appeal against the inadequate sentences. 
     
      
    56    The question now arises as to the correct sentence to be imposed on Count 14. I have previously demonstrated the high criminality of the appellant’s conduct on this count. The appellant made extensive admissions on his arrest on 5 April 1998 and further admissions on 7 April 1998. He pleaded guilty and has saved the community the expense of a number of trials, some of which would have taken some days. Many witnesses have been spared from having to give evidence. In some instances he named some of those involved with him in the offences, but mostly he declined to name his co-offenders.  
     
      
    57    He was born on 28 December 1977 so that he was either twenty or twenty-one when he committed this series of offences. He came to Australia from New Zealand in about early 1997. He had no prior convictions in Australia. He did have convictions in New Zealand for a break, enter and steal offence and some domestic incidents. The evidence does not disclose why he fell into such a serious and extended cycle of crime. The judge thought that special circumstances existed consisting of his young age, his lack of previous conviction and his co-operation with the authorities. I agree that there were special circumstances. This finding was not challenged. 
     
      
    58    It is doubtful whether the Crown would have been able to prove all the offences to which the appellant pleaded guilty without his admissions. At the start of his police interview the applicant was told that for an early plea he was entitled to a reduction in his sentence. Having regard to the gravity of the criminality, but taking into account the subjective features the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive and out of line with other sentences for a brutal armed robbery. The appellant is entitled to a discount for his early plea of guilty and his early admissions. A correct sentence on Count 14 would have been one comprising a term of imprisonment of fourteen years with a non-parole period of eight years. In reaching this conclusion, I have taken into account the offence of possessing a loaded firearm in King Street, Newtown. In addition to the special circumstances found by the judge I would add the cumulation of the sentences proposed in these reasons. 
     
      
    59    If this court had been so empowered I would have increased the sentences on the other counts of armed robbery. For example, on counts 20 & 21 involving the robbery of $20,000 from the Auburn Village Tavern and the robbery of the hotel manager (HA) personally respectively I would have imposed sentences of equal length to that imposed on count 14 having regard to the treatment and dire threats to which the hotel manager was subjected, notwithstanding that no other offences were being taken into account on those counts. To reflect adequately the criminality involved on the remaining counts of armed robbery (counts 1, 3, 4, and 6-13, 15-19 and 22-44. I would have imposed concurrent sentences of twelve years with a non-parole period of eight years on those counts. Applying the principles of totality I would have made the various sentences partly concurrent and partly cumulative, that is, I would have directed that the sentences on counts 1, 3, 4, 6 to 13, 15-19 and 22-44 (all inclusive) of 12 years with a non parole period of 8 years commence on 5 April 1998 and those on counts 14, 20 and 21 of fourteen years imprisonment commence on 5 April 2002 with a non parole period of 8 years to commence on that day. On count 5 (assault with intent to rob while armed with a dangerous weapon) I would have imposed a fixed term sentence of imprisonment of six years to start on 5 April 1998. 
     
      
    60    However, as earlier explained, because of the gap in the legislation, that is not a course which the court is empowered to take. The question at issue in the present case is whether the sentence imposed on count 14 should be cumulative or concurrent on the fixed term sentences of three years imposed on the other counts. The original sentence of 18 years with a minimum term of 12 years for count 14 was concurrent with the fixed three year terms. That sentence has had to be reduced to accord with principle but that does not mean that the reduced term should be concurrent. If that sentence was concurrent with the other sentences the total criminality would not be adequately reflected in the sentences imposed. Accordingly, the sentence on count 14 should be cumulative to those imposed on the other counts. 
     
      
    61    I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal against sentence on count 14 granted, appeal allowed; sentence quashed; 
       
       
      (ii) In lieu of the sentence imposed on count 14 the prisoner is sentenced to 14 years imprisonment to be cumulative on the fixed three year terms of imprisonment imposed by Judge Viney on the other counts; such 14 year sentence to start on 5 April 2001 with a non parole period of eight years commencing on that day.

    REGINA v Donny ITAMUA JUDGMENT 
     
      
       
      
    1    SHELLER JA: I agree with Smart AJ. 
     
      
    2    DOWD J: The applicant, having pleaded guilty on 15 October 1998, was sentenced on 5 March 1999 by Viney QC DCJ, in the Penrith District Court. 
     
      
    3    The applicant was charged and pleaded guilty to forty-two charges of robbery armed with a dangerous weapon, contrary to s97(2)(ii) of the Crimes Act 1900 (‘the Act’). This offence carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. The applicant was also charged with one count of assault with intent to rob whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, contrary to s97(2) of the Act, which similarly carries a maximum of twenty-five years imprisonment, and had taken into account a Form 1 offence of possessing a loaded firearm in a public place contrary to s93G(1)(a)(i) of the Act, which carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4    The offences occurred over a relatively short period of time, from early December 1997 to April of 1998. The applicant was sentenced on the fourteenth charge, taking into account the offence under Form 1, to a minimum term of twelve years penal servitude commencing on 5 April 1998, being the date that he went into custody, and to expire on 4 April 2010. He was sentenced to an additional term of six years, to commence on 5 April 2010 and to expire on 4 April 2016. 
     
      
    5    On each of the remaining charges, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of three years penal servitude, to commence on 5 April 1998 and to expire on 4 April 2001, the latter sentences to be served concurrently with the offence for which he received twelve years. 
     
      
    6    I have read the judgment in draft form of Smart AJ, and would agree with the summary of facts and the reasons outlined in his Honour’s judgment, except for the issue of totality as set out below. I would only add a few additional facts. 
     
      
    7    In respect of paragraph 8(f), concerning the Royal Hotel, Granville, I would add that on 6 April 1998, a co-accused, Tovio Antonio, surrendered himself to Fairfield Police Station, where he fully admitted to his involvement in the offence. Antonio implicated the applicant as being the person in the hotel with him, and in carrying the firearm. The description that was given by witnesses is consistent with that of the applicant, and the additional inquiries confirmed an association between the applicant and Crichton.  
     
      
    8     In relation to paragraph 8(h), regarding the Belfield RSL Club, I could only add the following. On 6 April 1998, a co-accused, Tovio Antonio, surrendered to police, and fully admitted his involvement in the offence. He implicated the applicant as being involved, and stated that the applicant was armed with a sawn off rifle. Additional inquiries confirmed the association of the applicant and Antonio on the morning of the offence. The applicant however, refused to comment on the offence. 
     
      
    9    Finally, in relation to paragraph 8(i) concerning the Fairfield Hotel, I would note additionally that the applicant later admitted to being the person at the door, and admitted that he was armed with a pistol. 
     
      
    10    Before turning to the matters concerning the application of the principles of Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, as set out from paragraph 10 onwards of His Honour’s judgment, I wish to set out and deal with the applicant’s grounds of appeal. The applicant submits that the sentence imposed by the Sentencing Judge was manifestly excessive, and that the learned Judge fell into error by: 
     
     1) Placing too much weight on the need for general deterrence, in relation to Mr Itamua. 
      
       
        
          
        
       
      
     2) Placing insufficient weight on the applicant’s plea at the earliest possible occasion. 
      
       
        
          
        
       
      
     3) Placing insufficient weight on the applicant’s subjective feature, including:

    4) Placing insufficient weight on the applicant’s assistance to the police. 
     
      
       
         
       
      
    5) In assessing the overall criminality, the Sentencing Judge placed too much weight of the subjective features of count 14. 
     
      
       
      
    11    I would make the following remarks as to each of those grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    12    General Deterrence 
     
      
      The gist of the applicant’s first ground of appeal is that the trial judge fell into appellable error in placing too much weight on the need for general deterrence in relation to the applicant.  
       
      
    13    I find, however, that this ground of appeal misstates what the trial judge in fact said as to deterrence. At page 3 of his remarks on sentence, Viney QC DCJ stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The situation these days, with armed robberies, is quite appalling in this State. They are committed with such regularity that the courts and the community, through their Parliamentary representatives, have, from time to time, expressed concern that not enough is being done by the courts to adequately punish these sorts of offences. It goes without saying that the victims are put in peril, in fear, and go through traumatic experiences at the hands of bandits who come into premises, such as in this case, late at night, armed with dangerous weapons, and to threaten and, at times, inflict harm on these people, take the money and the personal possessions of the victims, and put them in considerable fear and concern. No doubt, in many case, that fear and concern will last for a long time. 
         
        It seems to me, whatever sympathy one might have for Mr Itamua, the balance of consideration is that there has to be adequate punishment, for one reason to reflect the community’s attitude to this sort of offence, and, secondly, of course, to act as a deterrent to Mr Itamua, and equally to act as a deterrent to other people who might think that they commit these sorts of offences, and not receive the full weight of punishment that the law requires”. 
        
       
      
    14    As indicated in Broxam (Unreported, NSWCCA, 3 April 1980, Slattery CJ at CL, Reynolds and Carruthers JJ), there were some thirty or so victims of the armed robbery. These offences were obviously part of a larger overall planned series of offences. There is no question that there is a need to deter this type of offence: see Bavadra [2000] NSWCCA 292.  
     
      
    15    The decision in R v Henry & Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 436, dealing with less serious offences, indicated a clear need for deterrent penalties. Clearly, His Honour intended the penalty imposed in respect of charge fourteen to reflect the totality of the offences involved, as well as in terms of overall criminality and deterrence.  
     
      
    16    I do not consider that this ground of appeal is made out.  
     
      
    17    Plea at Earliest Opportunity  
     
      
      The second ground of appeal is that His Honour arguably placed insufficient weight on the applicant’s plea at the earliest opportunity. This matter was recognised by His Honour, but there is a limit to the weight which can be given in relation to the seriousness of the offence. The last offence was in circumstances where it was difficult for the applicant not to have been convicted.  
       
      
    18    It must be remembered that the penalty imposed, although reflecting the totality of all the offences, was in respect of the penalty which carried a twenty-five year maximum. His Honour was obliged to reflect carefully on the premeditation and planning, the use of guns, in particular that being loaded when the applicant was arrested. Added to that was the fact that the offences were carried out in company. Corporeal violence was inflicted on more than one victim, and the seriousness of the offence limited the extent to which the applicant’s early plea could be given weight. 
     
      
    19    I do not consider that this ground of appeal is made out.  
     
      
    20    Subjective Features  
     
      
      The applicant further submitted that His Honour placed insufficient weight on the applicant’s subjective features in assessing sentence. 
       
      
    21    It is clear from the application of s5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989, that His Honour was conscious of the excellent prospects of rehabilitation and the youth of the applicant, and in setting the sentence, took these matters into account. 
     
      
    22    Remorse would have been better shown by a greater level of co-operation. It is clear that the applicant was selective in the information which he gave to the police, and refused to provide information clearly within his knowledge which may have considerably assisted other convictions or arrests of co-offenders. 
     
      
    23    I do not consider that this ground of appeal is made out. 
     
      
    24    Applicant’s Assistance  
     
      
      The next ground of appeal was that His Honour placed insufficient weight on the applicant’s assistance. At several points during the record of interview, the applicant failed to assist in the identification of co-offenders, as I have referred to in the previous ground. It is clear also that the applicant, in respect of at least one offence, did not disclose his full contribution, nor did he assist in the location of the weapons. On one occasion, the applicant also declined to answer questions. At page 2 of his remarks on sentence, His Honour commented that the applicant was “co-operative with the police in disclosing the part he played and, on some occasions, naming some of the others involved, although he declined to name others”. 
       
      
    25    His Honour further commented that none of the main players in the offences were identified in what was a substantial scheme involving several other persons. There is limited assistance which could have been given in the light of the limited assistance provided by the applicant. This would have obliged His Honour to place as much weight as a full disclosure would have entitled the applicant. It is for this reason that each of the grounds of appeal, in my view, fail. 
     
      
    26    The sentence was high when examined as against the Judicial Commission’s statistics, but there is little information to compare the nature of these offences in these proceedings, and it is unlikely that the statistics reflect such a consistent pattern of serious criminality. 
     
      
    27    I would not grant leave to the applicant to appeal on this ground. 
     
      
    28    Overall Criminality as to Count 14 
     
      
      I have read the remarks of Smart AJ in paragraphs 10 to the end of his judgment, with which remarks I agree, except for the matter set out below. I also agree with the proposed orders.  
       
      
    29    I consider that there is a degree of artificiality in proposing to accumulate the new sentence on charge 14 on an existing three year fixed sentence on one of the other charges. I consider however, that there is, in any assessment of totality, a degree of artificiality, where a judge has to apply the totality principle where there are existing sentences, and a new sentence has to be fixed to reflect the principle of totality, taking existing sentences into account. I therefore concur in the proposed sentencing. 
     
      
    30    The matter in respect of which I do not agree with Smart AJ, relates to His Honour’s remarks in paragraph 15 in relation to Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 and Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 623-4. Mill and Pearce were decided before it was possible both to pass a sentence that was part concurrent and part cumulative. This latter course is demonstrated in the decision of this Court in R v Bavadra [2000] NSWCCA 292. 
     
      
    31    The use of partial accumulation and partial concurrence is now a preferred course. But in my view, the principle established in Pearce related to transparency and the desirability in fixing terms in respect of each offence. Pearce specifically referred to the principle of totality as it then existed, but did not purport to change that principle. It is, in my view, still open to a sentencing judge, within the proper sentencing range, to enlarge a sentence to reflect the totality of criminality in assessing a period of criminality over a number of offences. This is similar, although not precisely the same, to the exercise which a sentencing officer carries out when taking into account the offences on a Form 1 (see R v Bavadra [2000] NSWCCA 292) to enlarge a sentence. 
     
      
    32    As I have indicated, I otherwise agree with the remarks of His Honour and the proposed orders.  
     
      
    33    SMART AJ: Donny Itamua seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence of the District Court (Judge Viney) comprising a minimum term of twelve years imprisonment and an additional term of six years imprisonment imposed on Count 14. This was one of forty two offences of robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon which the applicant admitted that he committed between 8 December 1997 and 5 April 1998. There was a further admitted offence of assault with intent to rob whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. On all counts except count 14 the applicant was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of three years to commence on 5 April 1998, the date of commencement of the sentence on count 14. On that count the judge took into account the further offence of possessing a loaded firearm in a public place. 
     
      
    34    At the hearing before this Court there was a dispute as to the subject matter of Count 14. However, this is made clear by the judge’s endorsement on the Committal for Sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Convicted on all counts 
        
       
       
        
        Charge H478669/15 (robbery whilst armed with dangerous weapon at Auburn on 14.1.98) sentenced to a minimum term of 12 years penal servitude to commence 5.4.98 and expire 4.4.2010 together with an additional term of 6 years to commence 5.4.2010 and expire 4.4.2016…” 
        
       
       
      Charge H 478669/15 reads: 
       
       
        
        “That Donny Itamua on the 14th day of January 1998 at Auburn … being then armed with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a long barrelled handgun, a semi automatic pistol and a baseball bat did rob M- M- of certain property, to wit a man’s wallet, $300 in cash, one 18ct gold chain …the property of the said M- M-.” 
        
       
      
    35    This corresponds with count 14 on the Schedule of Offences handed to the judge at the sentence hearing. The judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I propose to impose a sentence in respect of matter number 14 which, on the face of it, seems to be one of the most serious of the offences, individually, and reflect in that sentence the total criminality. Although the offences occurred over a period of some months, it could be said they were one episode of criminality … I do not think it is appropriate, given the length of sentence I propose to impose, to have cumulative sentences. On the other matters there will be fixed terms.” 
        
       
      
    36    It will be necessary to look at count 14 and the overall position. 
     
      
       
      Count 14 
       
      
    37    About 1.50 am on 14 January 1998 up to five offenders entered the Auburn Village Tavern armed with a long barrelled handgun, a semi automatic pistol, a baseball bat and a club lock. All five men wore balaclavas or other disguises. One was a big man. He announced that this was a robbery, that they were serious and would shoot. Three of the men ordered everyone to the backroom. One man was hit in the ribs with the baseball bat and another on the face. Three of the men tied the hands of the patrons behind their backs. MM was tied around his hands and ankles and hit on the right side of the head with the bat. The barman was grabbed by the hair. The manager was taken away. Three of the men went around each patron on the floor taking their wallets and jewellery. One took MM’s wallet and tore his gold chain from his right wrist. A few minutes later the manager was brought back and sank to the floor. The man with the baseball bat said to the manager that he had not opened the safe downstairs but the manager asserted that he had. The man with the baseball bat threatened to blow the manager’s head off. The manager said that they should take him downstairs. He got up and went with that man and later returned. One of the men hit MM with a club-lock. MM was aged 17. 
     
      
    38    As the robbers left one of them stated “Don’t go near the doors for the next fifteen minutes or we will blow your heads off. Don’t try to be a hero.” 
     
      
    39    In his recorded interview of 5 April 1998 the appellant said that he was involved as a driver, driving the men to the Tavern. He did not go inside the Tavern. He appeared to be aware that wallets were taken from patrons at the Tavern but unaware that there had been any physical violence. He knew that when he drove the men to the Tavern they were going to commit an armed robbery and that when he went back to the house they would have money from the armed robbery. When they returned to David’s house after the armed robbery they gave him money, being part of the moneys taken during that armed robbery. 
     
      
    40    In his further recorded interview of 7 April 1998 the appellant confirmed that there were at least five people involved in the armed robbery of the Auburn Village Tavern. The appellant said that he was involved in driving some of the men to the Tavern. He had become aware about an hour prior to that the men were going to commit an armed robbery. He had earlier driven the men to David Lipani’s house, the robbery headquarters which were a short distance from the Tavern. After dropping the men off at the Tavern he went back to that house. 
     
      
       
       
      Overall Position 
       
       
      (a)  
      Auburn Village Tavern 
       - Seven other people were the subjects of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon and six were subjected to broadly similar treatment. One of those people, namely, the Night Manager of the Tavern, was subjected to even worse treatment. He was coerced by the armed robbers into opening up various places where money was kept and helping them to take the Tavern’s money. He was subjected to dire threats including death threats if he failed to co-operate. About $20,000 of the Tavern’s money was stolen. He also had his wallet, $175 cash, personal papers and cards taken.

      The Palms Hotel, Chullora 
       - 8 December 1997 
       
       
      Four males forced their way into the hotel about midnight. Weapons included a handgun and a baseball bat. The victims were bound with tape and the keys taken from the manager. The offenders took $20,000 of the hotel’s money. Five individuals in the hotel were also the victims of an armed robbery. In his recorded interview the appellant admitted being involved in the planning and preparation of the offences. He was aware that an armed robbery was to be committed by his associates and took them to the vicinity of the hotel for that purpose. He drove his brother’s car and waited in the car during the armed robberies. He drove the co-accused from the hotel knowing they had committed an armed robbery and later that morning received part of the proceeds from the offences. 
       
       
      (c)  
      Lucky L’ils Hotel, Parramatta 
       - 19 January 1998 
       
       
      The appellant who was in possession of a pistol attended the hotel with an unknown co-accused. The appellant was not wearing a balaclava. Four staff within the hotel were threatened and three of these staff members were tied up with plastic ties. The Assistant Manager was forced to open two safes. About $20,500 in cash belonging to the hotel was taken. Four individuals were also the victims of an armed robbery.

      Rosehill Hotel 
       - 2 February 1998 
       
       
      About 12.10 pm the appellant drove his brother’s vehicle with two accomplices to the vicinity of the Rosehill Hotel. The co-accused entered the hotel both armed with handguns and threatened the staff and patrons. Money was taken from the cash register. The Manager was forced to open a safe and cash of $11,959 was stolen. Patrons were forced to lie on the ground. The accomplices left the hotel and returned to the vehicle driven by the appellant which left the scene. The appellant admitted being involved in the planning and preparation of the offence; he was aware that an armed robbery was to be committed by his associates. He drove the co-accused from the hotel knowing that they had committed an armed robbery and received part of the proceeds from the offence. 
       
       
      (e)  
      The Mekong Club, Cabramatta 
       - 11 February 1998 
       
       
      Shortly after midnight two co-offenders entered the Club with their faces covered, one of them being armed with a handgun. Staff and patrons inside the Club were forced to lie on the floor in the Manager’s office. The Manager was forced to open the safe and money was stolen. Cash drawers about the Club were also ransacked and money was stolen from these drawers. About $44,000 in cash of the Club was taken. Three individuals were also the victims of threats and armed robberies. The appellant drove his brother’s vehicle to the vicinity of the offence and went inside the Club to confirm that there were not too many staff members thus making it a “low risk” job. After canvassing the Club the appellant returned to the car and informed the two co-offenders of his observations. The appellant waited in the car during the offences. He drove the co-offenders from the Club knowing that they had committed an armed robbery and later that morning received part of the proceeds from the offences. 
       
       
      (f)  
      Royal Hotel, Granville 
       - 20 February 1998 
       
       
      The appellant and a co-offender, by arrangement with the hotel doorman, entered the hotel which was closed. One of the offenders was armed with a semi-automatic handgun. At the time staff were counting the takings; threats were made and eventually $6,000 was stolen from the hotel. One individual was also the victim of an armed robbery. The available evidence was that it was the appellant who was the offender who entered the hotel with a gun. While the appellant admitted that he was involved in the preparation and planning of the offence and sharing in the proceeds he denied that he entered the hotel with a gun. He refused to name the other offenders.

      Berala Hotel 
       - 5 March 1998 
       
       
      About 4.00 am three offenders entered the hotel wearing balaclavas and armed with a semi-automatic handgun and a black aluminium baseball bat. Three staff members were threatened, two of them being immediately forced to the floor and being tied with cable ties. The Manager was forced to open a safe from which $21,000 was stolen. He was also tied with cable ties. Two individuals were also victims of the armed robbery. The appellant admitted to being involved in the planning and preparation of the offences, being aware that an armed robbery was to be committed by his associates, taking them in a vehicle to the vicinity of the hotel for that purpose and driving them from the hotel knowing that they had committed an armed robbery. The appellant received part of the proceeds from the offence.

       - 16 March 1998 
       
       
      On 16 March 1998 the appellant and a co-offender gained access to the club, the appellant being armed with a sawn off rifle. Both offenders were wearing balaclavas. Staff and cleaners were threatened and forced on to the floor. The Administration Officer was forced to open the safe from which $16,000 was removed by the offenders. One of the staff members was also the victim of an armed robbery.

      Fairfield Hotel, Fairfield 
       - 24 March 1998 
       
       
      The appellant pleaded guilty to an assault with intent to rob whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. A co-offender had attended at the hotel and surveyed it. The hotel’s security officer became suspicious and locked the doors of the Hotel. About 2.30 am the appellant wearing a balaclava and armed with a black handgun tried to force his way into the hotel through the doors. He pointed the handgun at the hotel security officer through a set of glass doors telling him that it was a holdup and for him to open the doors. The security officer refused and the appellant ran off.

      The Crescent Hotel, Fairfield 
       - 1 April 1998 
       
       
      About 1.40 am three offenders with their faces covered entered the hotel with one of them being armed with an automatic handgun. Staff and patrons inside the hotel were threatened and forced to lie on the floor. A security officer was forced to open a register in the poker machine change area and approximately $5,566 was removed by the armed offender. Four victims in the hotel were also the subject of armed robberies. The appellant admitted to being involved in the planning and preparation of the offence, driving his brother’s vehicle and his associates to the vicinity of the hotel and being aware that an armed robbery was to be committed by them. He waited in the car during the offence and drove the co-accused from the hotel knowing that they had committed an armed robbery. Later he received part of the proceeds from the offences.

      Portico Hotel - Toongabbie 
       - 28 December 1997 
       
       
      About 9.50 pm an offender entered the hotel carrying a silver pistol with a long barrel and a metal table leg. He wore a balaclava. He ordered the staff and patrons on to the floor and tied the four of them up. Another three masked male offenders entered the hotel. One of these offenders was armed with a double barrelled shotgun. The hotel Manager was forced to open the hotel’s safe. An amount of $4744 was removed. The hotel Manager was again bound and forced to lie on the flor. The appellant was identified by fingerprints developed on the table leg used during the commission of the offence. The Manager, another hotel employee and two patrons were each the victim of an armed robbery. The property taken from the individuals consisted of cash and assorted jewellery to the value of $15,000.

      Warwick Farm (Sunnybrook Hotel 
      ) - 12 March 1998 
       
       
      The appellant and three co-offenders entered the hotel about 1.35 am with the connivance of the security doorman. One co-offender who was armed with a black handgun threatened two victims. They were bound; one victim was made to open the hotel safe, whereupon $2,000 was removed. The appellant stated that he was the driver of his brother’s vehicle during the armed robbery. 
       
       
      (m)  
      Sandringham Hotel - Newtown 
       - 5 April 1998 
       
       
      The charge is that being armed with dangerous weapon, the appellant attempted to rob persons unknown of certain property, to wit, certain property including cash monies the property of the Sandringham Hotel. The appellant was arrested about 12.20 am opposite the Sandringham Hotel where he was getting ready to rob the hotel. He was carrying a semi-automatic pistol. He was further charged with possessing a loaded firearm, which was loaded with ten rounds of ammunition, in a public place, namely, the footpath of King Street, Newtown. 
       
      
    41    Thus, it can be seen that the appellant attended at thirteen hotels or clubs. In addition to the robbery of these, some thirty one individuals were the victims of an armed robbery. In some instances the evidence establishes that the appellant engaged in the preparations for the offence, driving co-offenders to the scene of the robbery knowing that a robbery was to take place, waiting for them, driving them away knowing a robbery had been committed and participating in the proceeds of the offence. In other instances the appellant’s involvement was even greater as he participated physically in the carrying out of the armed robberies in some of the hotels or clubs. The criminality revealed as to Count 14 was very high. It was also very high in other instances.  
     
      
    42    In Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 623-4, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “To an offender, the only relevant question may be ‘how long’, and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error. A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality. 
        
       
       
        
        Sentencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer arrived at by some process admitting of mathematical precision. It is, then, all the more important that proper principle be applied throughout the process. 
        
       
       
        
        Questions of cumulation and concurrence may well be affected by particular statutory rules. If, in fixing the appropriate sentence for each offence, proper principle is not applied, orders made for cumulation or concurrence will be made on an imperfect foundation. 
        
       
       
        
        Further, the need to ensure proper sentencing on each count is reinforced when it is recalled that a failure to do so may give rise to artificial claims of disparity between co-offenders or otherwise distort general sentencing practices in relation to particular offences.” 
        
       
      
    43    The course taken by the sentencing judge in the present case reflected the practice which existed in New South Wales prior to Pearce. Indeed, the Court of Criminal Appeal of this State had made it clear that on sentence appeals it was only concerned with the effective total of the sentences involved and not with the matter in which individual sentences were structured. That approach is no longer open. In Pearce at p 624 the High Court further said  
     
      
       
        
        “The appeal under s 5(1) of the 
          
        Criminal Appeal Act 
         1912 (NSW) being an appeal against ‘a sentence’, it was, of course, the individual sentences that fell for consideration, not just their overall effect. If the court ‘is of opinion that some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed, [it] shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor’” 
        
       
      
    44    The importance of the principle of totality was emphasised by the High Court in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 62-63. At p 63 the Court said as to totality: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Where the principle falls to be applied in relation to sentences of imprisonment imposed by a single sentencing court, an appropriate result may be achieved either by making sentences wholly or partially concurrent or by lowering the individual sentences below what would otherwise be appropriate in order to reflect the fact that a number of sentences are being imposed. Where practicable, the former is to be preferred.” 
        
       
      
    45    The approach taken in Pearce has special force where the major sentence has been imposed on one count and subsequently the conviction on that count has been quashed and either a verdict of acquittal entered or a new trial ordered. This brings into sharp focus the correctness of the sentences imposed on the other counts. 
     
      
    46    The problem faced by a sentencing judge becomes acute where there are a large number of offences being dealt with. In Fraser [2000] NSWCCA 97 at para 18 this Court held that where the offender has been sentenced for as many as twenty five offences the Court is not obliged to impose a series of separate sentences with separate commencement dates. The idea of imposing twenty five consecutive sentences each of a few months would be both impractical and verging on the absurd. The problems are usually best overcome by making the sentences concurrent or partially cumulative and partially concurrent or by making one group of sentences on a number of charges concurrent and another group of sentences on a number of other charges, those sentences being concurrent as between themselves, cumulative on the first group. This last mentioned course was permissible at the time the judge imposed his sentences.47    It is unnecessary to deal with the other grounds of appeal against sentence as the Court has to re-sentence to conform with Pearce. 
     
      
    48    The concurrent sentences for a fixed term of three years are in almost all instances manifestly inadequate having regard to the gravity of the offences. On the other hand, a sentence of eighteen years with a non-parole period of twelve years for one count of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon is, in the circumstances of this case, manifestly excessive, even allowing for the fact that it was a bad case. The judge in his reasons stated that he was reflecting the total criminality in the sentence he was imposing on Count 14. That is not an approach which Pearce and Mill permit. When the judge dealt with these sentences on 5 March 1999 he did not have the power to impose sentences that were partly concurrent and partly cumulative. That limitation has been overcome by s 55(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which commenced on 3 April 2000. 
     
      
    49    As earlier noted there has been no appeal by the appellant against the concurrent fixed term sentences of three years penal servitude. Nor has the Crown appealed against their inadequacy despite this being manifest. The question arises whether this Court if it considers that the judge has erred in his approach can alter the fixed term three year sentences on the ground that they were manifestly inadequate and that the overall sentence which remains after resentencing on Count No 14 does not adequately reflect the totality of the criminality. 
     
      
    50    In McL v The Queen (2000) 74 ALJR 1319 the High Court considered s 569(1) of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic). Section 7(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is to the same effect. That sub-section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “7(1) If it appears to the court that an appellant on an appeal under section 5(1), though not properly convicted on some count or part of the indictment, has been properly convicted on some other count or part of the indictment, the court may either affirm the sentence passed at the trial or pass such sentence whether more or less severe in substitution therefor as it thinks proper, and as may be warranted in law by the conviction on the count or part of the indictment on which it considers the appellant has been properly convicted.” 
        
       
      
    51    McL was convicted on numerous counts of sexual offences against his two step-daughters and sentenced to twelve years imprisonment with a non-parole period fixed at ten years. The Victorian Court of Appeal quashed four convictions but otherwise dismissed the appeal. This had the effect of reducing the total effective sentence of imprisonment to eight and a half years. However, the non-parole period remained at ten years. The High Court upheld the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal that the sentences imposed on the remaining counts were manifestly inadequate and it exercising its powers under s 569(1) of the Crimes Act (Vic) and re-sentencing the appellant on all remaining counts. The result was that the appellant received increased sentences on all the remaining counts with a total effective sentence of twelve years imprisonment and a non-parole period of ten years. Some of the sentences were concurrent and some were cumulative.  
     
      
    52    McL differs from the present case in that in McL there was an appeal against all convictions and four were quashed. There is no appeal against conviction in the present case. Section 7(1) depends upon there being an appeal against conviction and the appellant not being properly convicted on some count or part of the indictment but being properly convicted on some other count or part of the indictment. It is not directed to the case where there is no appeal against conviction but an application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    53    In the opening words of their judgment in McL Gleeson CJ, Gaudron & Callinan JJ at 1320 highlighted the limitations of s 569(1) of the Crimes Act 1968 (Vic), the counterpart of s 7(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) by stating that it gave power to the Court of Appeal “in a criminal appeal, in certain circumstances, to re-sentence an appellant who has been convicted of multiple offences and who successfully appeals against some of his convictions.” 
     
      
    54    Section 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that a person convicted on indictment may appeal with the leave of the Court against the sentence passed on the person’s conviction. Section 6(3) provides that on an appeal under s 5(1) against a sentence, the Court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal. Sections 5(1)(c) and s 6(3) do not empower this Court of its own motion or at the invitation of the Crown to intervene in respect of sentences in respect of which no appeal is brought by either the appellant or the Crown. There is no equivalent of s 7(1) where there is an appeal against sentence simpliciter. 
     
      
    55    The situation which exists is anomalous but there is no statutory provision which enables the Court to overcome it, where, as here, there is an excessive sentence on one count and inadequate sentences on all or most of the other counts. There is a pressing need for remedial legislation to cover this unfortunate gap. Regrettably, the Court is bound to proceed on the basis that it cannot disturb any of the current fixed term three year sentences. Pending any remedial legislation the Crown should give consideration, where there are multiple counts, to revising its traditional approach of looking at the overall sentence and not appealing if the overall sentence is within permissible limits even though some of the individual sentences are manifestly inadequate. Of course, this would only be necessary where there has been an application for leave to appeal against one or some of a number of sentences by an accused and the remaining sentences are manifestly inadequate. One of the problems which the Crown faces is that it does not know whether the application for leave to appeal by the accused and his appeal will be successful. Nevertheless, to protect the public interest the Crown may, in such a situation, need to appeal against the inadequate sentences. 
     
      
    56    The question now arises as to the correct sentence to be imposed on Count 14. I have previously demonstrated the high criminality of the appellant’s conduct on this count. The appellant made extensive admissions on his arrest on 5 April 1998 and further admissions on 7 April 1998. He pleaded guilty and has saved the community the expense of a number of trials, some of which would have taken some days. Many witnesses have been spared from having to give evidence. In some instances he named some of those involved with him in the offences, but mostly he declined to name his co-offenders.  
     
      
    57    He was born on 28 December 1977 so that he was either twenty or twenty-one when he committed this series of offences. He came to Australia from New Zealand in about early 1997. He had no prior convictions in Australia. He did have convictions in New Zealand for a break, enter and steal offence and some domestic incidents. The evidence does not disclose why he fell into such a serious and extended cycle of crime. The judge thought that special circumstances existed consisting of his young age, his lack of previous conviction and his co-operation with the authorities. I agree that there were special circumstances. This finding was not challenged. 
     
      
    58    It is doubtful whether the Crown would have been able to prove all the offences to which the appellant pleaded guilty without his admissions. At the start of his police interview the applicant was told that for an early plea he was entitled to a reduction in his sentence. Having regard to the gravity of the criminality, but taking into account the subjective features the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive and out of line with other sentences for a brutal armed robbery. The appellant is entitled to a discount for his early plea of guilty and his early admissions. A correct sentence on Count 14 would have been one comprising a term of imprisonment of fourteen years with a non-parole period of eight years. In reaching this conclusion, I have taken into account the offence of possessing a loaded firearm in King Street, Newtown. In addition to the special circumstances found by the judge I would add the cumulation of the sentences proposed in these reasons. 
     
      
    59    If this court had been so empowered I would have increased the sentences on the other counts of armed robbery. For example, on counts 20 & 21 involving the robbery of $20,000 from the Auburn Village Tavern and the robbery of the hotel manager (HA) personally respectively I would have imposed sentences of equal length to that imposed on count 14 having regard to the treatment and dire threats to which the hotel manager was subjected, notwithstanding that no other offences were being taken into account on those counts. To reflect adequately the criminality involved on the remaining counts of armed robbery (counts 1, 3, 4, and 6-13, 15-19 and 22-44. I would have imposed concurrent sentences of twelve years with a non-parole period of eight years on those counts. Applying the principles of totality I would have made the various sentences partly concurrent and partly cumulative, that is, I would have directed that the sentences on counts 1, 3, 4, 6 to 13, 15-19 and 22-44 (all inclusive) of 12 years with a non parole period of 8 years commence on 5 April 1998 and those on counts 14, 20 and 21 of fourteen years imprisonment commence on 5 April 2002 with a non parole period of 8 years to commence on that day. On count 5 (assault with intent to rob while armed with a dangerous weapon) I would have imposed a fixed term sentence of imprisonment of six years to start on 5 April 1998. 
     
      
    60    However, as earlier explained, because of the gap in the legislation, that is not a course which the court is empowered to take. The question at issue in the present case is whether the sentence imposed on count 14 should be cumulative or concurrent on the fixed term sentences of three years imposed on the other counts. The original sentence of 18 years with a minimum term of 12 years for count 14 was concurrent with the fixed three year terms. That sentence has had to be reduced to accord with principle but that does not mean that the reduced term should be concurrent. If that sentence was concurrent with the other sentences the total criminality would not be adequately reflected in the sentences imposed. Accordingly, the sentence on count 14 should be cumulative to those imposed on the other counts. 
     
      
    61    I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal against sentence on count 14 granted, appeal allowed; sentence quashed; 
       
       
      (ii) In lieu of the sentence imposed on count 14 the prisoner is sentenced to 14 years imprisonment to be cumulative on the fixed three year terms of imprisonment imposed by Judge Viney on the other counts; such 14 year sentence to start on 5 April 2001 with a non parole period of eight years commencing on that day.

      REGINA v. JANIS SCHUBERT 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: The accused Janis Schubert stands indicted for the crime of murder. She is charged that she did on or about 6 May 1999 at Hillsdale in the State of New South Wales murder Tony Sadek. To that charge she has pleaded not guilty. 
    2   An election under s.32 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1996 (now s.16 of that Act) has been filed and accepted by the Director of Public Prosecutions and in consequence she has proceeded to trial before me rather than before a jury. 
    3   On such a trial s.17 of the Criminal Procedure Act applies. Section 17 provides:- 
     
      
       
       ""(1) a judge who tries proceedings without a jury may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of the guilt of the accused person. Any such finding has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) a judgment by a judge in any such case must include the principles of law applied by the judge and the findings of fact on which the judge relied. 
       
      
      
       
       (3) if any act or law requires a warning to be given to a jury in any such case the judge is to take the warning into account when dealing with the matter."" 
       
      
    4   On my reading of that section I am required to make findings so that I will reach a verdict. I am required to include in my judgment the principles of law I have applied, the findings of fact which I make and such warnings as the law requires be taken into account. 
    5   In Regina v. Murphy [2000] NSWCCA 297, a Court of Criminal Appeal comprising the Chief Justice, Grove and Kirby, JJ. examined the contents of what should be included in a judgment by a judge under these provisions. In particular, examination was made of the effect of the decision of the High Court in Fleming v. The Queen (1998) 158 ALR 379. In the judgment of Kirby, J., with whom the Chief Justice and Grove, J. agreed, appeared a statement of the statutory obligations to comply with s.17 at paragraphs 47-48. His Honour considered the extent to which it was necessary to canvass the individual matters in evidence in the reasons for judgment at paragraphs 50-53. 
    6   What has been said in that decision and said by the High Court in Fleming (supra) is, however, to be considered in the context that the function that I am performing is as a tribunal of fact as well as law, performing, in respect of the fact finding function, that role that a jury would otherwise perform.  
    7   The contents of the reasoning that must be exposed in such a judgment is affected by that role and also by the very nature of the criminal proceedings in which the onus and standard of proof bear so heavily. 
    8   It is clear that I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the elements of the offence charged and any alternative offence. It is clear that the onus is on the prosecution so to satisfy me, absent any statutory requirement otherwise for any particular defence or partial defence, for instance, such defences or partial defences as mental illness or diminished responsibility. 
    9   Here, no question arises of either of those matters, notwithstanding there has been raised before me questions of reduced intellectual capacity. 
    10   What has been raised are matters going to acquittal and an alternative offence of manslaughter arising either by reason of the application of the unlawful and dangerous act doctrine or by reduction of the offence from murder to manslaughter by reason of provocation (see s.23A of the Crimes Act 1900). 
    11   It is necessary to consider firstly the elements of the primary offence of which the accused stands charged. Murder in New South Wales shall be taken to be committed in the circumstances provided for by s.18 of the Crimes Act. 
    12   In this case it is necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt an act of the accused which caused the death charged and which was done with the requisite intentional state under the section, that is, done with intent to kill or with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm or done whilst referring to the probability that death might be caused to the deceased but done anyway. And in each case it is necessary that what the accused did with the requisite intent was done without lawful cause or excuse or was not done in defence of herself or another. 
    13   The definition of murder in the Crimes Act catches up the common law relating to malice insofar as that common law is embodied in the s.5 definition of that concept in that Act and the common law as to self-defence which has recently been expressed by the High Court for Australia in Zecevic v. The Director of Public Prosecutions (1987) 162 CLR 645 and for New South Wales in Regina v. Hawes (1994) 35 NSWLR 294 at 396, and Regina v. Conlon (1993) 69 A. Crim. R. 92 at 97. 
    14   It therefore becomes necessary for me to consider whether, on the evidence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the elements of the offence of murder and that the accused's action causing the death was not done in defence of herself or another (as that matter is to be considered in the light of the authorities) subject to one further matter to which I will now turn. 
    15   In this case self-defence has been raised on the evidence but it has been raised in particular in a context in which the evidence deals with the entry into premises, shared by the accused with her fiancee, by the deceased, which entry commenced an assault by the deceased upon the accused and her fiancee. That assault immediately preceded the act upon which the Crown relies for the occasioning by the accused of the deceased's death, that act being the stabbing by the accused of the deceased. 
    16   Consequently not only has common law self-defence been raised, but also provocation under s.23A (to which I will turn if necessary) and also the applicability of the Home Invasion (Occupants Protection) Act 1998. 
    17   I have had the benefit of extensive written submissions from both the Crown and the defence concerning the ambit of that Act. Further, I have had the benefit of extensive written submissions from the Crown and the defence concerning the evidence and such factual findings as I might make. 
    18   The Act provides by s.4 a definition of the term intruder. A person is an intruder for the purposes of the Act if:- 
     
      
       
       ""(a) the person makes an unlawful entry into a dwelling house; and 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       (b) an occupant of the dwelling house believes that the person, in addition to the unlawful entry, has committed or is committing a crime in the dwelling house against an occupant of the dwelling house or the property of, or within, the dwelling house."" 
       
      
    19   The evidence to which I will turn later clearly establishes that the deceased was an intruder as so defined. The Crown does not make any submission to suggest but that the deceased's actions were such that the definition of intruder applied to him. I am entirely satisfied that he was an intruder within that definition. 
    20   Section 6 of the Act provides that the occupants of the dwelling house (and the Crown makes no submission to suggest that the accused was other than within that concept and so I find) may act in self-defence against an intruder if the occupant believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to do so. 
    21   Section 7 provides for the occupants to act in defence of others on the same basis. 
    22   Section 9 provides whether grounds are reasonable grounds for the purposes of ss.6 and 7 is to be determined having regard to the belief of the occupant based on the circumstances as the occupant perceived them to be. 
    23   By s.10 the onus of proof to rebut the occupants having that belief or not having reasonable grounds for that belief is placed squarely on the Crown and the standard is beyond reasonable doubt. 
    24   Section 11 confers an immunity from criminal liability upon a person whose actions fall within the statutory provisions to which I have referred. 
    25   In the extensive submissions on the law, debate has proceeded on whether the Act confers a possibly wider protection than the common law of self-defence, as considered in those cases to which I have already referred. Submissions were put that it abolished the necessity for proportionality in response. The Crown expressed the view that the Act may in fact be wider in its ambit as conferring protection upon an accused than the common law of self-defence. 
    26   Suggestions that were put in argument included that common law self-defence remained notwithstanding the passing of the Act even as applicable to the home invasion situation to which the Act speaks. I do not accept that suggestion. 
    27   Provided to me on these questions, was the second reading speech of the Minister for Police, the debate in the Legislative Assembly and the second reading speech in the Legislative Council by the Honourable the Attorney General on the Bill. That last speech clearly sets out the ambit that it was thought the Act might have. The debate and the speech of the Minister for Police make it quite clear that proportionality is retained. 
    28   The Honourable the Attorney General on 21 October 1998 in the Legislative Council (in Hansard at 8704) echoes what had been said elsewhere as to the bill codifying and clarifying the law in relation to self-defence within the home. 
    29   The Attorney General recognises that self-defence under the current common law and the immunity conferred by the Act are alike in conferring in the relevant circumstances an entitlement to a complete acquittal. 
    30   The Attorney General says this:- 
     
      
       
       ""I turn now to discussion of the key provisions. Clause 6 seeks to codify the law of self-defence within the home for the occupants of dwelling house against intruders. The provision codifies the settled common law test that the accused must honestly believe on reasonable grounds that it was necessary to do what he or she did in self-defence. In the leading case of  
       Zecevic 
        in 1987, the High Court stated:- 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         'The question to be asked in the end is simple. It is whether the defendant believed upon reasonable grounds that it was necessary in self-defence to do what he did. If he had that belief and there were reasonable grounds for it, or if the jury is left in reasonable doubt about the matter, then he is entitled to an acquittal.' 
         
        
       
      
    31   He continued:- 
     
      
       
       ""In other words, in order to obtain a conviction in cases where self-defence is raised, the prosecution must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant did not believe on reasonable grounds that it was necessary in self-defence to do what he or she did. The definition is balanced in two ways. First, the defendant must have actually believed that the degree of force used was necessary. Second, that belief must have been based on reasonable grounds. These two elements build into the law in this area the crucial concept set of proportionality."" 
       
      
    32   The Attorney continued to describe the relevant provisions of the Bill and in particular referred to clause 6 and also clause 7 as conferring the right to protect others in addition to the right to protect oneself. 
    33   In discussing Clause 9 which codifies, he said, the interpretation placed on the reasonable grounds required under the Zecevic test, the Attorney said as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""That is, it states that the reasonable grounds requirement discussed above should be interpreted with reference to the position and perception of the accused, and not with regard to some completely objective analysis. New South Wales courts have held that it is the belief of the accused, based upon the circumstances as the accused perceived them to be, which has to be reasonable, and not the belief of the hypothetical person in the position of the accused. So much is clear from the leading New South Wales decisions of 
        Regina v. Hawes 
        in 1994 and 
        Regina v. Conlon 
        in 1993."" 
       
      
    34   It therefore appears to me that in the belief of the legislators the Act was intended to codify the law relating to self-defence, defence of others and defence of property in and around the home. This accords with my own view of the terms of the Act. The immunity conferred by the Act has in this context replaced the common law in the relevant situation of the home (see Regina v. Downes (1985) 18 A. Crim. R. 75), at least to the extent that the common law is expressed by or included in what is said in the Act. 
    35   Insofar as the drafting of the Act may, as was submitted by counsel for the accused, have produced an immunity or defence which is wider in ambit than the common law defence, by reason of the utilisation of phraseology relating to reasonable grounds and belief in necessity, it will only be necessary for me to determine that if I am of the view that the actions of the accused did not fall within the ambit of the defence, as it existed at common law, and within the ambit of the provisions of the Act as far as they were suggested to extend by the legislature. The accused, in her account, denies intent to kill and asserts her act was done in defence of herself and her fiance. 
    36   Since, at common law and under the Act, the onus to rebut self-defence is on the Crown, the Crown must persuade me beyond reasonable doubt that the defence does not apply. 
    37   On this aspect, it is necessary to consider the evidence of what matters might have affected the accused's perception of her circumstances and of the circumstances of others. Her account to the police is before me by way of an extensive interview given by the accused voluntarily shortly after the events giving rise to the charge. 
    38   In addition there is in evidence what has been described as a ""walk through"" video in which the accused took police officers to the scene and described the various events to them. 
    39   Further, there was tendered by the defence two medical reports, being the report of a neuropsychologist Julie Hendy of 26 October 2000, together with the results of her clinical testing, and a report of Associate Professor Susan Hayes of 18 March 1999 of her clinical assessment of the accused. 
    40   It is sufficient to say that the observations contained in those reports concerning the intellectual impairment of the accused accord with her conduct and her answering of questions of the police in the interviews to which I have referred. 
    41   She is a person who is plainly suffering from a significant degree of mental impairment in her intellectual function. It is necessary to bear that in mind when having regard to the matters in evidence. 
    42   It is particularly necessary to have that in mind when having regard to her perception of the events and her perception of what she needed to do, so as to ascertain whether the existence of the defence has been rebutted by the Crown. 
    43   In the very helpful written submissions provided to me by the Crown and the defence, there is much which is of common ground. In those submissions the Crown reminds me that it is necessary for me, before being persuaded of the guilt of the accused, to be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence that the act of the accused causing the death was unlawful and this would follow, by reason of an absence of self-defence, by reason of it being done maliciously or by reason of an absence of lawful cause or excuse. Those submissions remind me, and I direct myself accordingly, that the defence of self-defence applies to the principal charge of murder and the alternative charge of manslaughter. 
    44   In that regard the observations the Crown has made relate also to the immunity conferred by the Act. 
    45   The Crown in its written submissions sets out facts drawn from the evidence which are not in dispute:-  
     
      
       
       ""The accused is now 20 years of age (19 years at the time of the fatality) and suffers from mild intellectual disability. She has no prior criminal convictions and should be regarded as a person of good character. 
       
      
      
       
       The deceased was 19 years of age at the time of his death and from all accounts was not previously prone to aggressive behaviour. 
       
      
      
       
       The accused and her fiance were the lawful occupiers of the premises at 2/12 Brittain Crescents, Hillsdale (""the premises""). 
       
      
      
       
       Without being invited, the accused (sic) came to the premises late on the evening of 5 May 1999. He repeatedly banged on the front door of the premises, which was opened by the accused. In an angry and aggressive fashion he pushed past the accused, pushing her with his hands so that she fell backwards. He then walked quickly to where Dauller Simao was seated and punched him a number of times around the side of his head and neck. 
       
      
      
       
       The accused attempted to restrain the deceased whereupon the deceased responded by either pushing her back and/or punching her in the face and kicking her. The accused fell to the ground. The deceased again punched Dauller Simao before stating that his brother was outside and that his brother wanted to speak to Bradley Robinson. 
       
      
      
       
       The accused telephoned the emergency number (000) and asked for the police to come to the premises. 
       
      
      
       
       The deceased and Bradley Robinson left the flat. 
       
      
      
       
       The accused went into one of the bedrooms and removed a large carving knife from a locked toolbox. 
       
      
      
       
       The accused went outside and onto the driveway that ran parallel to the block of home units. It was here that the deceased was fatally wounded."" 
       
      
    46   These facts set the scene for examination of particular matters in evidence at the trial and consideration of the crucial questions of intent and self-defence. 
    47   The premises were occupied on the occasion of the entry by the deceased, by the accused, her fiancee Dauller Simao, the person Bradley Robinson and another person Rohin Wilkes. Dauller Simao, Bradley Robinson and Rohin Wilkes have given evidence of matters relevant to those issues. 
    48   Bradley Robinson gave evidence that the deceased, leaving the premises, had been followed by the accused with the knife. That witness was some 13 paces down the driveway outside the premises. The deceased had left the premises only a couple or more paces. The witness gave evidence of seeing a downward motion by the accused with the knife, by a plunging action of her hand. He described the blade as projecting downwards from the fist, at one point, and in particular when he was reminded of his prior accounts. He had earlier in evidence described a motion of the accused's arm parallel with the ground, with the knife used in a spear-like fashion. His accounts in this regard were inconsistent. It was apparent to me that at times he appeared to be reconstructing events as he believed they might have been rather than describing what he himself had seen or experienced. I am unable to accept much of what he said, in particular, his evidence concerning the accused shouting two or three times or more, ""I'm going to kill you"" or, ""I'm going to knife you"" on which he was referred to a prior account given by him to the police.  
    49   Rohin Wilkes, who remained in the premises, gave evidence that the accused said words to the effect of, ""I'm going to kill you"" prior to her leaving the flat and before confronting the deceased immediately outside the flat at the place at which he met his death. 
    50   With Mr. Wilkes, too, I refer to matters which gave me reason to find his evidence unreliable. They are, in particular, his quite serious intellectual and reading deficits, acknowledged memory problem and prior inconsistent accounts. All were such that I felt that I could not rely upon what he said without dependable, independent corroboration on matters that were seriously in contest. 
    51   I note that I have, having regard to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act, administered to myself the requested warnings under s.165 concerning the credibility and reliability of Rohin Wilkes and Bradley Robinson for the reasons which I have expressed. 
    52   As to the things said to have been said by the accused, those things were not heard by Dauller Simao, (no relevant assault upon his credibility was made) and they were not heard by Mrs. Smith, a neighbour, who might have been expected to hear them. I found Mr. Simao's evidence highly persuasive. 
    53   For the purpose of ascertaining what the intent of the accused was at the time at which the action was done which caused the deceased to meet his death, I would not be prepared to depend upon those matters as being reliable pieces of evidence insofar as they are in contest and denied. 
    54   They are denied by the accused in the extensive interview that she gave. I consider her intent is best to be gauged from what she did and what she said concerning what happened. 
    55   There was some evidence, inconsistent though it was with other evidence from Mr. Robinson, that when she left the flat to meet the deceased just outside it, there was, according to Mr. Robinson, a ""bit of a fight"" before she stabbed him. That evidence from the only eyewitness does not assist the acceptance of his other accounts. 
    56   I have already referred to the incongruity of Mr. Robinson's evidence concerning the mode of stabbing. 
    57   The nature of the wound itself which involved, it was accepted, the piercing of the femoral artery in the groin, and there was no evidence to suggest any particular force was necessary for this to occur, does not itself bespeak a clear intention to kill (see Regina v. Cutter (1997) 94 A. Crim. R. 152 for an illustration of the reluctance one must have to draw a conclusion of a particular intent in specific factual circumstances). Nor am I satisfied of the mode of infliction of the wound such as would enable me to infer the relevant intent. 
    58   The accused in her interview refers to a physical altercation with the deceased in which she ""just struck out and that was it"". She refers to ""getting him in the leg"". 
    59   The Crown, in order to support its submission on intent to kill, intent to cause grievous bodily harm, or reckless indifference to human life (that intentional state is sufficient for the offence in New South Wales and would not appear to be the intentional state referred to as exempted from the operation of the defence of self-defence by the High Court in Zecevic (supra)) refers to a belief by the accused that she had been raped by the deceased on the evening of 4 May; that she was in any event, whether raped or not, angry at the deceased since she might, in her consideration of possibilities, have been infected with a life threatening disease or might have been jealous of his involvement with some other woman. 
    60   In this regard, the Crown submits that, taking these matters in context, including her obtaining the knife and following the deceased as he went out of the door of the flat, one could accept sufficient of Bradley Robinson's description of what occurred with what she said in her interview so that one could accept beyond reasonable doubt that she intended to kill, intended seriously to injure or looking at the probability that she might kill and realising she might kill, taking the action that she did. 
    61   The Crown submitted:- 
     
      
       
       ""The evidence is more consistent with a finding that the attack by the deceased was over and no immediate peril was imminent. In those circumstances the pursuit by the accused of the deceased could be seen as action by her to seek revenge or punishment of the deceased."" 
       
      
    62   That submission as expressed recognises the essential problem with which this trial has been concerned. It is not a matter of seeing whether there is some ""more consistent"" evidentiary basis for guilt, but whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the requisite intent, and did the requisite act other than in the exercise of self-defence as she perceived to be necessary having regard to her perception of the events. 
    63   There could be no doubt that the attack on Dauller Simao and on her by the deceased was a very violent and vicious attack and was so perceived. Whatever may have motivated it, whatever it may have had to do with whatever relations she may have had with the deceased a day earlier, or whatever it may have had to do with what Dauller Simao may have said to someone else, there appears on the evidence unanimity that the home was invaded and the occupants attacked, that the occupants had the basis, on reasonable grounds, to perceive that they were at risk of attack. And there is no evidence to rebut the asserted belief by the accused that the deceased might return or might have been a threat to her friend outside. 
    64   It is not a matter of whether I think it is probable that she was right in what she might have believed. I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she did not believe those matters or had no reasonable grounds for that belief, having regard to her perception of the events. 
    65   There is nothing in the evidence which would rebut the proposition that the deceased, having assaulted the persons inside the premises, was linking up with his brother outside the premises and likely to return or to remain in the vicinity of the premises with hostile intent, when one has regard to the matters which the accused says she perceived. 
    66   The prior sexual events have little bearing on these questions. 
    67   The Crown submits that there was no evidence from which the Court could infer that the deceased was the initial aggressor towards the accused after she came outside with the knife. I have already referred to evidence from Bradley Robinson on that question. But the true issue is whether there is evidence, having regard to the prior assault, from which I would infer, that the accused was the aggressor when she came outside with the knife. In that respect the Crown refers me to her request to the deceased to ""Leave us alone"" and the deceased's reply ""Piss off, leave me alone"". ""Why are you doing this to me."". 
    68   From that, even in the total context, I do not derive the proposition that the accused was embarking upon an aggressive attack on the deceased or utilising violence towards him, except for the protective purposes for which the immunity under the Act and the defence at common law exist. 
    69   It is not necessary for me, therefore, in the circumstances of this matter, to go further. It is not necessary for me to consider further the defence of provocation or the alternative charge of manslaughter.  
    70   It is important, having regard to the decision to which I have come, that I make it clear that in my view the reasons which I give under the section of the Criminal Procedure Act are not to be regarded as reasons for someone being acquitted of an offence. To look at them in that way would be to suggest a reversal of the onus of proof. At law, unless the tribunal of fact is persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the offence has been made out, that tribunal is required to acquit. They are reasons why I am not persuaded of the accused's guilt. 
    71   The lack of persuasion of a relevant matter is something which can be explained to some extent by a rejection or a non acceptance to the requisite standard of particular items of evidence but need not be, and indeed should not be, the cause of the explication of the entire reasoning process lest, in the reasoning, the onus is reversed. It is necessary, however, that I say sufficient to meet the parties' right to expect that the arguments and evidence would be dealt with in such a way that it could be understood as to what had been accepted or rejected, and what process of reasoning had occurred (see Regina v. Maxwell (CCA, unreported 23 December 1998)), and it is also necessary that deficiencies in proof be exposed publicly for the public purpose of the judgment. But it is not necessary, in my view, nor desirable, that reasons should be given beyond that, where the tribunal has, as I have here, come to the view that the accused should be acquitted of the offences charged. 
    72   My verdict is that the accused is not guilty of the charge of murder and not guilty of the charge of manslaughter and I enter a judgment of acquittal accordingly.

     REGINA v Simon Gautier HANNES 
     
     
      
    The Appellant was convicted of one charge of insider trading under s1002G(2) and s1311 of the Corporations Law and two charges under s31(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth). The prosecution arose from circumstances in which a person who identified himself as “M. Booth” instructed Ord Minnett Brokers to acquire options to purchase shares in TNT Limited with a strike price of $2 maturing in November 1996. After these options were purchased an announcement was made that TNT would be taken-over at a price of $2.45 per share. This announcement resulted in a substantial increase in the price of the options which resulted in the contracts bought in the name of “M. Booth” returning a profit of over $2 million. 
     
      
    The Appellant was an Executive Director of Macquarie Corporate Finance, a division of Macquarie Bank Limited which for some time had advised TNT. The key issues in the insider trading charge were whether or not the Appellant had access to and made use of information obtained at Macquarie Corporate Finance with respect to the prospect of a take-over of TNT and whether he had purchased the TNT options in the name of “M. Booth”. The central issue in the Financial Transaction Reports Act charges concerned the circumstances in which the Appellant came to withdraw cash from his personal account, and the circumstances in which bank cheques were acquired and deposited into the account from which the purchase of the options was funded.HeldSumming Up - Generally(Per Spigelman CJ, Studdert and Dowd JJ agreeing)1 Discussion of appropriate approach to analysis of summing up on appeal. Jones v Dunkel (1958-1959) 101 CLR 298, R v Holden [1974] 2 NSWLR 548, R v Hong Jus Ten and Ing Chin Ei (Western Australian Court of Criminal Appeal, 6 November 1973, unreported), R v Piazza (1997) 94 ACrimR 459, R v Sorlie (1925) 25 SR (NSW) 532, R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91, Stoddard’s Case (1909) 2 CrAppR 217 referred to. ([106]-[110])2 Discussion of need for a trial judge to give fair and balanced directions to the jury. Cleland v The Queen (1982) 151 CLR 1, Domican v The Queen (1991-1992) 173 CLR 555, RPS v The Queen (2000) 74 ALJR 449, R v Guerin [1967] 1 NSWR 255 referred to. ([111]-[117], [175])Appropriate directions on use to which the fact that an accused does not give evidence may be put(Per Spigelman CJ, Studdert and Dowd JJ agreeing)3 Since the trial, the High Court has decided RPS v The Queen supra which confined the circumstances in which a trial judge should direct the jury that it can draw inferences more safely because of the failure of the accused to give evidence pursuant to the earlier High Court decision in Weissensteiner v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217. ([124])4 Before a Weissensteiner direction can be given, the prosecution must specify the particular evidence which could be expected to come only from the accused. RPS v The Queen supra considered. This requirement was not satisfied in respect of one of the inferences on which the trial judge commented - that “Hannes was Booth”. ([163]-[164]) The appeal should be upheld with respect to all charges on this basis. ([170]) The appeal from the insider trading conviction should also be upheld by reason of the Weissensteiner direction with respect to knowledge of the take-over. ([167])5 It may not be appropriate to give a Weissensteiner direction when an accused faces multiple charges with different elements. However there was no relevant distinction between the charges in this case. R v OGD (1997) 45 NSWLR 744 distinguished. ([131]-[135])Trial Judge’s Directions6 The trial judge’s direction that it was irrelevant if “another person was involved” created a risk of confusion on the part of the jury. ([172]-[216])7 The appeal with respect to other directions of the trial judge concerning elements of the insider trading charge, not upheld. ([217]-[299])Grounds of Appeal concerning Evidence8 Grounds of appeal based on the rejection of a draft broker’s report, the admission of conversations and the summarising of expert evidence, rejected. ([300]-[322])Handwriting Evidence(Per Dowd J, Spigelman CJ and Studdert J agreeing)9 There was evidence before the jury from which it could be inferred that all documents used as control documents for the purposes of the opinion evidence on handwriting were written by the Appellant. ([487]-[502])(Per Spigelman CJ, Studdert and Dowd JJ agreeing)10 The admissibility of a document tendered for the purpose of providing a standard for comparison for handwriting under the Evidence Act is determined by s56(1) which provides that evidence which is relevant is admissible. This approach differs from that previously existing under the common law. ([323]-[328])Identification Evidence(Per Dowd J, Spigelman CJ and Studdert J agreeing)11 There was no breach of s3ZO(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) to enliven the exclusionary provision in s138 of the Evidence Act 1995 as at the time the photoboards were used, the investigators did not have a “suspect”. ([520]-[534])Admissibility of MFI 95(Per Spigelman CJ, Dowd J agreeing, Studdert J contra)12 The statements in MFI 95 were relevant because the circumstances in which the document was made - that it was a personal rumination and the that it was not retained - mean it is probative of the facts asserted. Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 applied. ([331]-[337])(Per Spigelman CJ, Dowd J agreeing, and per Studdert J)13 The representations in MFI 95 are excluded by the operation of s59 of the Evidence Act. ([338]-[361]), [475]-[478])(Per Studdert J, Spigelman CJ and Dowd J agreeing)14 The document was not admissible under s72 of the Evidence Act because evidence of the Appellant’s intention at the time that document was written was not relevant to a fact in issue. ([479]-[480])15 The document was not admissible under s81(2) of the Evidence Act because it did not contain representations that have a link sufficient for the purposes of s81(2) with any admission made by the Appellant. ([481]-[483])FTRA Counts(Per Studdert J, Spigelman CJ agreeing with additional reasons and and Dowd J agreeing)16 The trial judge’s direction that it was sufficient for the Crown to prove that the Appellant was a party to two or more of the six withdrawal and nine payment transactions particularised, respectively, in the second and third counts, was in error as it failed to alert the jury to the need for unanimity on the two transactions selected. ([421]-[426])17 In respect of the second count there was no possibility of a miscarriage of justice because there was no rational basis for distinguishing between the withdrawals particularised. KBT v The Queen (1996-1997) 191 CLR 417 distinguished. ([429]-[436])18 In respect of the third count, there was no need, given the other directions that her Honour had given, for a specific direction that the jury had to be unanimous in their finding as to the same transaction. The jury could only find the Appellant was a party to seven of the payments particularised, if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was “Booth”. KBT v The Queen supra distinguished. ([437]-[458], [365])Non-Consensual Verdict(Per Dowd J, Spigelman CJ and Studdert J agreeing)19 There is no basis for concluding that the jury were pressured by the length of the trial or deliberations, or that the jury’s verdict was other than consensual. ([535]-[548])Unreasonable Verdict(Per Spigelman CJ, Studdert and Dowd JJ agreeing)20 It was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty of all of the offences. The verdict was not unreasonable with the meaning of that phrase in Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s6(1). ([367]-[388])New Trial or Acquittal(Per Spigelman CJ, Studdert and Dowd JJ agreeing)21 The strength of the Crown case and the public interest involved in the prosecution of this offence are such that the proper order is for a new trial.

     REGINA v Simon Gautier HANNES 
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
      
     
     
      
       
        
       
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an appeal from the conviction of the Appellant on 11 August 1999 of one charge of insider trading, under s1002G(2) and s1311 of the Corporations Law, and from his conviction on 6 August 1999 of two charges, under s31(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth) (the “FTRA”). On 17 September 1999, her Honour Judge Backhouse of the District Court imposed a sentence on the Appellant of two years and two months imprisonment and a fine of $100,000 for the insider trading charge. Her Honour imposed a sentence of four months imprisonment and a fine of $5,000 for each charge under the FTRA. The terms of imprisonment were to be served concurrently. Her Honour fixed a recognisance release period after eighteen months. The Crown has appealed against the alleged inadequacy of the sentences. 
     
      
    2    The trial was concerned with the circumstances in which a person, who identified himself as “M. Booth”, instructed, on or about 17 September 1996, Ord Minnett brokers to acquire options to purchase shares in TNT Limited, a publicly listed company. The options had a strike price of $2, and matured in November 1996. Pursuant to this order, options were purchased between 18 and 20 September at prices up to 2c per option, until the total amount purchased equalled the amount in a cash management trust in the name “M. Booth”. On 2 October 1996 an announcement was made that TNT would be taken over at a price of $2.45 per share. By reason of this announcement, the price of the November options increased substantially. The profit on the option contracts bought in the name of “M. Booth” was of the order of $2 million. 
     
      
    3    The Appellant was an executive director of the merchant bank Macquarie Corporate Finance (“MCF”) a division of Macquarie Bank Limited, which had, for some time, been advising TNT.  
     
      
    4    The key issues on the insider trading charge were whether or not the Appellant had access to and made use of MCF information as an insider with respect to the prospect of a takeover and whether he had purchased the TNT options in the name of “M. Booth”. The central issue on the FTRA charges concerned the circumstances in which the Appellant came to withdraw cash from his account and to acquire bank cheques, which cheques were paid into the account from which the options were acquired. 
     
      
    5    The three counts in the indictment were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “… that SIMON GAUTIER HANNES 
        
       
       
        
        1 between 17 September 1996 and 20 September 1996 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, contravened s1002G(2) of the Corporations Law in that he 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) being possessed of information that was not generally available but which, if it were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of securities of a body corporate, namely $2.00 November 1996 option contracts to buy shares in TNT Limited;  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) knew or ought reasonably to have known that such information was not generally available and that if it were generally available it might have a material effect on the price or value of those securities 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        purchased securities of TNT Limited namely 5000 $2.00 November 1996 option contracts to buy shares in TNT Limited. 
        
       
       
        
        … that SIMON GAUTIER HANNES 
        
       
       
        
        2 on 9 September, 1996 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales was a party to two or more non-reportable cash transactions, as defined under the Financial Transaction Reports 
         Act 
        , 1988, and having regard to the manner and form in which those transactions were conducted, it would be reasonable to conclude that he conducted those transactions in that manner and form for the dominant purpose of ensuring that the currency involved in those transactions was transferred in a manner and form that would not give rise to a significant cash transaction as defined under the Financial Transaction Reports Act, 1988. 
        
       
       
        
        … that SIMON GAUTIER HANNES 
        
       
       
        
        3 on 9 September, 1996 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, was a party to two or more non-reportable cash transactions, as defined under the Financial Transaction Reports Act, 1988, and having regard to the manner and form in which those transactions were conducted, it would be reasonable to conclude that he conducted those transactions in that manner and form for the dominant purpose of ensuring that the currency involved in those transactions was transferred in a manner and form that would not give rise to a significant cash transaction as defined under the Financial Transaction Reports Act, 1988.” 
        
       
      
    6    With respect to the first count the Crown supplied particulars of the Information as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was a prospect that shares in TNT would be the subject of a takeover. There was a prospect that the offer would be at a price in excess of $2 per share. The Corporate Advisory Division of Macquarie Corporate Finance (MCF) was advising TNT in connection with that possible takeover and had placed securities in TNT on an embargo list.” 
        
       
      
    7    With respect to the second count, the particulars of transactions supplied were, six cash withdrawals all occurring on 9 September 1996, four of which were in the amount of $9,000, one in the amount of $9,900 and one in the amount of $6,000. The withdrawals were made from six different branches in different parts of Sydney. With respect to the third count, the particulars of transactions supplied were, nine bank cheques each acquired for cash on 9 September 1996 from nine different bank branches. Eight of the cheques were in the amount of $9,000 and one for $9,900. Each bank cheque was payable to Perpetual Trustee Co Limited - Ord Minnett Cash Management Trust. The cheques were paid into the account from which the TNT options were funded. 
     
      
    8    The trial was a long and complex one. It took 36 sitting days up to the time of the trial judge’s summing-up to the jury. The Crown called 45 witnesses (including three expert witnesses) and the defence called two witnesses (one an expert). There were more than 200 exhibits, some voluminous. The closing addresses of the Crown and senior counsel for the Appellant continued over six sitting days. The trial judge’s summing-up proceeded over four days. Further directions were given in response to questions from the jury. 
     
      
    9    On the eighth day of the jury’s deliberations, a verdict of guilty was returned on the two FTRA counts. The jury then indicated that they had been unable to reach a unanimous verdict on the insider trading count. The trial judge gave the jury a direction of the character identified in R v Black (1993) 179 CLR 44. The jury deliberated for a further two days before returning a verdict of guilty on the insider trading count. 
     
      
    10    This appeal has been inordinately delayed to the extent that the Appellant has served all but three months of his recognisance release period. This delay is not attributable to the Crown. 
     
      
    11    Notice of Appeal against conviction was filed on 3 September 1999. The Crown lodged its appeal against sentence on 8 October 1999. Both appeals were listed for mention in this Court on 22 November 1999 and again on 13 December 1999. On these dates the transcript of the summing-up was not available. The matter was stood over until 7 February 2000. The transcript became available on 21 December 1999. On 7 February, the Appellant asked that the matter be adjourned to 10 April 2000. The Appellant engaged new counsel to prepare amended grounds of appeal and to appear. The amended Notice of Appeal was filed with the Court on 22 May 2000, subject to the Appellant’s formal instructions. On 26 May 2000 the appeals were fixed for hearing at a date convenient for senior counsel engaged by the Appellant. 
     
      
    12    On a number of occasions the Crown expressed concern as to the delay. At the callover on 10 April 2000, senior counsel for the Crown asked the Court to note that the Crown would resist any submission that the Court not order a retrial as a matter of discretion, on the basis that the sentence had been served by the time the appeal was heard. 
     
      
    13    It can readily be seen that, for a person in Mr Hannes’ position, the conviction itself is of great significance. He has, understandably, proceeded on the basis that he would accept delay in order to permit him to put forward the best possible case, with counsel of his choice. The Crown took appropriate steps to protect its position in the light of the delay so occasioned. 
     
      
       
      The Statutory Provisions 
       
      
    14    The insider trading offence was constituted by s1311 of the Corporations Law, which relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “1311(a) A person who: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) does an act or thing that the person is forbidden to do by or under a provision of this law; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        is guilty of an offence by virtue of this subsection …” 
        
       
      
    15    The forbidden act was found in s1002G(2), which relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        1002G(2) The insider must not (whether as principal or agent): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) … purchase … any such securities …” 
          
         
        
       
      
    16    The references in this paragraph to both “the insider” and to “such securities” relate back to s1002G(1) which is the subsection that identifies the additional elements of the offence by specifying each of the circumstances which, cumulatively, have the consequence that a purchase of securities will constitute a contravention and, accordingly, an offence.  
     
      
    17    That subsection provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “1002G(1) Subject to this Division, where: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a person (in this section called the  
          insider 
          ) possesses information that is not generally available but, if the information were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of securities of a body corporate; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the person knows, or ought reasonably to know, that: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) the information is not generally available; and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) if it were generally available, it might have a material effect on the price or value of those securities …” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
      Each of the provisions are the subject of further definition.  
       
      
    18    By s1002A the word “securities” in Div 2A, entitled “Insider trading”, is defined, inter alia, to include: 
     
      
       
        
        “(e) an option contract under which a party acquires from another party an option or right, exercisable at or before a specified time, to buy from, or sell to, that other party a number of securities of a kind referred to in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) at a price specified in, or to be determined in accordance with, the contract”. 
        
       
      
    19    The definition of “securities” specifies that in relation to a body corporate that word means, inter alia, “shares in the body corporate”.  
     
      
    20    There was no issue at the trial, or in this Court, that the options contract over shares in TNT were within the section. Issues did however arise with respect to other elements within s1002G(1). 
     
      
    21    First, “possesses information”. The word “information” is defined inclusively in s1002A(1) to extend to: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) “matters of supposition and other matters that were insufficiently definite to warrant being made to the public; 
         
         
        (b) matters relating to the intentions, or the likely intentions, of a person.” 
        
       
      
    22    Secondly, “not generally available”. The positive form “generally available” is defined in s1002B(2) in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “1002B(2) Information is generally available if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) it consists of readily observable matter; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) without limiting the generality of paragraph (a), both the following subparagraphs apply: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) it has been made known in a manner that would, or would be likely to, bring it to the attention of persons who commonly invest in securities of bodies corporate of a kind whose price or value might be affected by the information; and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) since it was so made known, a reasonable period for it to be disseminated among such persons has elapsed.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    23    Furthermore, s1002B(3) adds the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “1002B(3) Information is also generally available if it consists of deductions, conclusions or inferences made or drawn from either or both of the following: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) information referred to in paragraph (2)(a); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) information made known as mentioned in subparagraph (2)(b)(i).” 
          
         
        
       
      
    24    Thirdly, “material effect”. The standard of what a reasonable person would expect is set out in s1002C: 
     
      
       
        
        “1002C For the purposes of this Division and section 1013, a reasonable person would be taken to expect information to have a material effect on the price or value of securities of a body corporate if the information would, or would be likely to, influence persons who commonly invest in securities in deciding whether or not to subscribe for, buy or sell the first-mentioned securities.” 
        
       
      
    25    Fourthly, the mental element. The two factors which that person must know, or ought reasonably to know, are set out in s1002G(1)(b)(i) and (ii) as quoted above. 
     
      
    26    This outline of the statutory scheme establishes the central significance of identified “information” in any proceedings for an offence for contravention of s1002G(2). It is specific information which: 
     
      
       
      (i) a person must “possess”. 
       
       
      (ii) must not be “generally available”. 
       
       
      (iii) if it were generally available, would have a material effect. 
       
       
      (iv) the person knows, or ought to know, both that it is not generally available and, if it were, that it might have a material effect. 
       
      
    27    Accordingly, the particulars of Information supplied by the Crown, as quoted above, were a critical aspect of the Crown case and of the conduct of a fair trial. 
     
      
    28    The ‘Information’ on which the Crown relied for each of the purposes for which that term is material in s1002G of the Corporations Law, consisted of the cumulative effect of four separate elements: the prospect of a take-over, the price at which the take-over would occur, the fact that MCF was advising TNT in connection with that take-over and, finally, that MCF had placed securities in TNT on an embargo list. All four of these aspects were part of the Crown case. 
     
      
    29    The Crown did not seek to amend the above particulars at any time. The Appellant did not object to the particulars provided in any respect and did not seek further particularisation. The particulars were before the jury as the “Information” which it had to find existed in the respects for which the concept is used in the section creating the offence. 
     
      
    30    The relevant provisions of the FTRA are set out in the judgment of Studdert J. 
     
      
       
      The Crown Case 
       
      
    31    As quoted above, between 18 and 20 September 1996 Ord Minnett brokers acquired, on behalf of a client, TNT November call options at a strike price of $2. The price of TNT shares at the time of the acquisition of the options was between $1.56 and $1.59. The brokers were acting on behalf of a client known to them as “Booth”. The broker who conducted the transactions, Mr Andrew Staehli of Ord Minnett, never met “Booth”. His communications with a person purporting to be “Booth” had occurred on the telephone and in correspondence. The account in the name of “M. Booth” had been opened on 17 September 1996. The standard form documentation required by Ord Minnett is in that name. The Cash Management Account was given Investment Number B3133. 
     
      
    32    Funds were placed in the Ord Minnett Cash Management Account between 6 September 1996 and 9 September 1996 by ten bank cheques. Each of the bank cheques had been acquired for cash at the bank branches, in the amounts and on the dates following:

    33    The bank cheque acquired on 6 September 1996 was not provided as a particular of count 3, the FTRA payments charge. The Crown case was that it was on that date that Mr Hannes acquired information about the reporting obligations under that Act. 
     
      
    34    The Crown called evidence to show that the Appellant had access to the requisite amount of cash on the relevant dates. The Appellant conducted, in his own name, an account at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Wynyard branch. On 5 September 1996 the Appellant transferred to that account an amount of $200,000 from an account he controlled at Ord Minnett brokers. On 6 September 1996 three cash withdrawals were made from that account. An amount of $20,000 was withdrawn at the CBA Pitt Street/Martin Place branch; an amount of $10,000 was withdrawn at the CBA Chatswood branch; an amount of $10,000 was withdrawn at the CBA Circular Quay branch.  
     
      
    35    These three withdrawals on 6 September 1996 were not provided as particulars of Count 2, the FTRA withdrawals charge. As they were reportable transactions, they could not have been particularised. In any event, as noted above, the Crown case was that it was only after that date that Mr Hannes structured the financial transactions to avoid the reporting requirements under that Act. 
     
      
    36    The six withdrawals which were particularised for the FTRA charge were as follows:

    37    All of the withdrawals and bank cheque acquisitions were relied on for purposes of the insider trading charge. 
     
      
    38    There was little dispute either at the trial or in the appeal, with respect to the basic steps taken that led to the acquisition of the TNT call options. The evidence of Vanessa Heperi, a cash manager at Ord Minnett, concerning the opening of an Ord Minnett Cash Management Trust Account B3133 was not challenged. The evidence of Andrew Staehli, a stockbroker with Ord Minnett, who received instructions to acquire the TNT options, with payment from the aforesaid cash management account, was also not challenged in any material respect. 
     
      
    39    An application form dated 1 September 1996 was used to open the cash management account B3133. The application was in the name of and signed by “M. Booth”, with an address given as “Suite 140, 656 Military Road, Mosman, New South Wales, 2088”. This is a mailbox. It was opened by “Mark Booth” who indicated that he had no identification with him at the time. The fee was paid in cash. The contact phone number and address given was the Intercontinental Hotel. The Crown proved that no-one of that name was a resident of the hotel at any relevant time. 
     
      
    40    The cash management account was opened with an initial deposit of $9,000. Each of the nine bank cheques referred to above were deposited in this account. The first deposit was the CBA Martin Place bank cheque. It was deposited on 6 September 1996. Under a covering note of 9 September, the other eight bank cheques were deposited on that day. 
     
      
    41    Ms Heperi said that she received a telephone call on 17 September 1996 from someone who identified himself as “M. Booth” requesting information on the cash management account and specifically the account balance. He said that he wanted to start trading with Ords and did not have an adviser at Ords. She transferred him to the switch and advised that he was a new trader. 
     
      
    42    Mr Staehli gave evidence that on 17 September 1996 he received a phone call from “Mark Booth” who wanted to trade in options. Arrangements were made for “Booth” to pick up an application from Ord Minnett reception. “Booth” asked for a quote on TNT November $2 options, Mr Staehli quoted between 1-2c and said it was a “fairly risky option to buy”. “Booth” asked Mr Staehli to invest the $90,000 which was in “Booth’s” cash management account in options. “Booth” said he was staying in a hotel and provided the phone numbers 9230 0200 and 955 7070, the former being the number at the Intercontinental Hotel and the latter having one digit less than a Sydney telephone number and not otherwise identified. 
     
      
    43    On 19 September 1996 Mr Staehli received an envelope with a letter of instructions, an Options Client Agreement, an Application for Individual Account and Sponsorship Agreement. Mr Staehli completed a form document entitled Record of Interview re Opening New Account. 
     
      
    44    The letter of instructions of 17 September 1996 was signed “M Booth”. It confirmed that Mr Staehli should acquire TNT $2 November 1996 call options at a price of up to 2c per option. He should acquire such options up to the amount standing to the credit of the cash management trust account. The letter also asked if it was possible for the securities to stand in the name of the broker’s nominee company.  
     
      
    45    The Options Client Agreement Form was set out in the name of “Mark Booth” and signed “M. Booth”. The address given was the mailbox, Suite 146, 56 Military Road, Mosman, 2088. 
     
      
    46    The Application for Individual Account was also made out in the name of “Mark Booth” at the same address, with a business telephone number of 955 7070 and a private telephone number of 9230 0200, the latter was asterisked with the annotation “Currently staying in hotel. Do not leave private messages at this no.” 
     
      
    47    The Sponsorship Agreement was also issued in the same name and with the same address, with a signature of “M. Booth” which purported to be witnessed by “Alexi Voltraint”, who purported to give an address of “52 Railway Road, Petersham”. 
     
      
    48    The Record of Interview re Opening New Account was filled out on the basis of the information supplied in the aforesaid documentation. 
     
      
    49    Thereafter the following purchases were made: 
     
      
    · 2,500 contracts at 1.5c on 18 September 1996; 
     
      
    · 910 contracts at 1.5c on 19 September 1996; and 
     
      
    · 290 contracts at 2c on 19 September 1996 (recorded as 20 September 1996). 
     
      
    50    On 20 September 1996 “Booth” advised Mr Staehli by telephone that the purchase had been completed. ”Booth” advised him of a new number 9902 8224. This number was a voicemail account opened on 19 September in the name of “Mark Booth”. The account for the voicemail service was also paid in cash. 
     
      
    51    The withdrawals and the bank cheques were, respectively, the subject of counts 2 and 3. However, the flow of funds into the account from which the options were purchased, was also of central significance to the insider trading count. 
     
      
    52    There was no issue that the Appellant withdrew the funds in cash from his own account. The Crown case on count 2, i.e. the FTRA count with respect to six withdrawals, was that the Appellant had become aware of the FTRA obligations when withdrawing the three amounts of $20,000, $10,000 and $10,000 from, respectively, the CBA branches at Pitt Street/Martin Place, Chatswood and Circular Quay. These three withdrawals, together with the subsequent four withdrawals for $9,000, one of $9,900 and one of $6,000 - being withdrawals from the Neutral Bay, Crows Nest, Liverpool/Castlereagh Street, Town Hall and Wynyard branches, all on 9 September - were also relied upon as covert conduct in support of the insider trading charge, being particularly relevant to the element of possession of information and the mental element. Indeed, as noted above, Mr Hannes had transferred funds from an account he controlled at Ord Minnett to his CBA account. The Crown called evidence that by a single transaction, moneys could have been transferred from one Ord Minnett account to another. 
     
      
    53    The cash was withdrawn in $100 and $50 notes. Four of the nine bank cheques, being all the cheques about which such evidence was available, were purchased with a mixture of $100 and $50 notes. 
     
      
    54    Each of the cheques was payable to “Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd - Ord Minnett Cash Management Trust”. Those cases which recorded the details of the customer were: CBA, George Street; ANZ Bank, Camperdown; NAB, Leichhardt; Westpac, Annandale; Westpac, Roseville; NAB, Roseville. In each such case the customer was identified as “M. Booth” and the address was given was “Suite 140, 656 Military Road, Mosman 2088”. Two cheques from the Commonwealth branches at Camperdown and Leichhardt did not record any such particulars. 
     
      
    55    A number of bank tellers gave evidence about the appearance of the person who acquired the bank cheques. Some gave evidence identifying the customer from a photoboard of photographs of persons who attended the relevant branch on the day. Such evidence was also given by persons who attended to the opening of the mailbox and the voicemail account. This is the subject of a separate ground of appeal. There was handwriting evidence about the various application forms. This is also the subject of a separate ground of appeal. 
     
      
    56    It was, in my opinion, open to the jury to conclude that Mr Hannes had acquired all of the bank cheques and to draw that conclusion based solely on his own admissions during the Record of Interview.  
     
      
    57    When he was asked during that interview what he had done with the cash withdrawn from his account, he referred to the “general statement” he had earlier made. (AB3780). In that statement (commencing at AB3743) he had said that a syndicate partner: 
     
      
       
        
        “… asked for a hundred thousand and he asked if I could get it in cash.” (AB3747) 
        
       
      
    58    In a subsequent conversation with that person, Mr Hannes said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… he told me that he needed cheques to put in an Ord Minnett cash management account.” (AB3749) 
        
       
      
    59    Mr Hannes also said in his record of interview: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well he asked me to get cash and then he asked me to get cheques for the cash management trust.” (AB3757) 
        
       
      
    60    He also said: 
     
      
       
        
        This individual … he had told me that he had - that there was a mail box, there was a mail box, we had a mail box and we were going to have a bank account which was going to be this Ord Minnett bank account. So ultimately I withdrew all this cash and made it out in cheques, as he requested, to this Ord Minnett bank cash management account or whatever it was. So that’s the - reference to all this money being withdrawn and deposited. That’s how I contributed my money.” 
        
       
      
    61    The two references to withdrawing “all this cash and made it out in cheques” and to “all this money being withdrawn and deposited” could be accepted by the jury as an admission of two facts: 
     
      
    · Mr Hannes obtained all the bank cheques. 
     
      
    · He used the name “M. Booth” to do so. 
     
      
    62    He was asked to identify an ANZ Bank bank cheque application form. Mr Hannes said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I may well have when I got the bank cheques for Ord Minnett, right, put it in the name of my sister.” (AB3781) 
        
       
      
    63    His sister’s name was Mignon Booth. Notwithstanding the use of the word “may”, this statement could also be accepted by the jury, in a context where he had already referred to a request to obtain cheques up to $100,000, as an admission of two facts: 
     
      
    · Mr Hannes obtained all the bank cheques. (“I got the bank cheques for Ord Minnett). 
     
      
    · He used the name “M. Booth” to do so. 
     
      
    64    Immediately after this answer, Mr Hannes continued without a further substantive question: 
     
      
       
        
        “A And not only that, I think they gave me a copy of this and I gave it to Mr X - I gave him the cheques. 
        
       
       
        
        Q That’s the paperwork. 
        
       
       
        
        A I gave him the cheques and I gave him all the junk. He knew that I was investing in the name of my sister.” 
        
       
       
      These answers reinforce the admission of each of the facts outlined above. 
       
      
    65    Hannes was then shown the ANZ Camperdown branch cheque for $9,000 and he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well you ask me to identify a specific cheque. I mean, what I said in my general statement - I don’t recall it, but what I did say is I tracked - I was asked to get cash originally. He then told me he wanted cheques, he needed cheques made out to Perpetual Trustee, Ord Minnett Cash Management Trust and I obtained those cheques. I withdrew that cash and I obtained those cheques and then I gave that to him.” (AB3782) 
        
       
      
    66    In a context where a total amount of $100,000 had been mentioned as required in bank cheques, each of the two references in that passage to “I obtained those cheques” is an admission with respect to all nine cheques. 
     
      
    67    When his attention was drawn to the address “656 Military Road”, Mr Hannes said that that was the address given to him by “Mr X” (AB3783 and AB3785). That address only appeared in the application forms in combination with the name “M. Booth”. 
     
      
    68    In the course of a question about the NAB Leichhardt branch bank cheque, which like eight of the nine cheques was in the amount of $9,000 (one was for $9,900), Mr Hannes said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I’m not denying that I went and got cheques, right, in these amounts and, as I say, it was to be in the name of my sister, Mignon Booth, I’m not denying that.” (AB3785) 
        
       
      
    69    Again this reference to “got cheques … in these amounts”, in the context, is an admission that he obtained all the bank cheques. This is reinforced by the fact that he admitted in a number of instances that the “M. Booth” name “may well be” his own handwriting.  
     
      
    70    Relevant to the two cases in which no name was set out in the application form; the following question and answer appears at A3286: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Did you write those words or those letters that comprise the word “M. Booth” on these application forms I’ve shown you? 
        
       
       
        
        A If they asked me to - in some circumstances I might and some they - I might not have. Because I didn’t - I recall I didn’t write out - I don’t recall filling out all these slips …” 
        
       
      
    71    The issue arose again later in the Record of Interview: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Why did you get a series of bank cheques to the value of $9,000 each from different banks. 
        
       
       
        
        A What happened was first he initially asked for cash … He then changed his mind and said he wanted bank cheques right? So then I made out all these bank cheques - got all these bank cheques.” (AB3796) 
        
       
      
    72    To similar effect Mr Hannes said: 
     
      
       
        
        “And then I gave all those things to my partner my - Mr X, when I gave him - well we both needed the address, he knew that I was doing it in my sister’s name; and I gave all those cheques and all the pieces of paper … to this guy.” (AB3804-3805) 
        
       
      
    73    In the context of a request for $100,000 - to which Mr Hannes subsequently referred as a request for “roughly a hundred thousand” (AB3800) - each reference to “all these bank cheques” and “all those bank cheques” is a further admission by Mr Hannes that he obtained all nine bank cheques. 
     
      
    74    This conclusion is further reinforced by the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q … the residual withdrawals add up to approximately either 81 or 91 thousand dollars. By coincidence, its a similar amount that was lodged at Ord Minnett cash management - 
        
       
       
        
        A That’s not a coincidence. That is the money.” (AB3797) 
        
       
      
    75    What was lodged at Ord Minnett was nine bank cheques. The admission that his own cash withdrawals were “the money” so lodged is, in the context, an admission that he obtained all of the bank cheques. 
     
      
    76    It was open to the jury to conclude that there were actual admissions by Mr Hannes that he obtained a number of bank cheques in the name of “M. Booth” and that the admissions constituted an admission that he obtained all nine of the bank cheques that were deposited in the Ord Minnett account. That account had also been opened in the name of “M. Booth” and all transactions on it were conducted by a male person who used that name. 
     
      
    77    The conduct of the person (or, possibly, on the Appellant’s contention in this appeal) the persons, who acquired the bank cheques to finance the acquisition of the bank cheques - small denominations in a number of different bank branches in different parts of the city - was capable of being accepted by the jury as constituting an attempt to ensure that it would be difficult to connect the transaction by documents and also to ensure that no bank officer had any reason to remember the transaction or the person conducting it. Furthermore, insofar as an obligation to report transactions under the FTRA scheme could provide regulatory authorities with information, there would, a jury could conclude, be no such trail. 
     
      
    78    The means by which Mr Hannes withdrew the cash and the means by which Mr Hannes (and/or another person) acquired the bank cheques, constituted a significant part of the Crown’s circumstantial case on the insider trading charge. An attempt to make the flow of funds difficult to trace supports the Crown case on a number of elements of the offence, especially the possess information element and the mental element. To give only one example, an attempt at concealment appears to be the only reasonable explanation why one person - “M. Booth” - should, on the one day, attend at the Roseville branches of two banks, NAB and Westpac, to acquire for cash two bank cheques in the same amount payable to the same person. 
     
      
    79    At 9.00am on 2 October 1996 an announcement was made by the Stock Exchange that a take-over bid had been made for TNT by a Dutch company and the shares rose to $2.25. 
     
      
    80    By letter of 3 October 1996, signed by “M. Booth”, Mr Staehli was instructed to hold the TNT options until 4 November 1996 and thereafter to begin to sell them for the best price obtainable. 
     
      
    81    The sale resulted in a sum of $2,039,710, which amount was transferred to Booth’s cash management account between 25 and 28 November 1996. 
     
      
    82    At no time did Mr Staehli meet “Booth” face to face. 
     
      
    83    In a letter to Mr Staehli of 3 October 1996, “Booth” referred to a message about investigations into the trade in TNT options. The letter said “I assume this is standard practice here and if my permission is required you have it. Please contact me if more information is required.”  
     
      
    84    By letter of 4 October 1996, also signed “M. Booth”, the author expressed concern about the continued publicity and the suspicion about insider trading in the options. This letter said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is extremely disturbing, as even airing of such allegations would be professionally damaging to me.” 
        
       
       
      The author went on to express an intention to cooperate with the authorities and attached a statement of recollection of the events. That statement explained why he invested in those options and stated, in view of the newspaper articles about insider trading, that: 
       
       
        
        “I had no knowledge whatsoever of a take-over bid of any sort for TNT was in prospect.” 
        
       
      
    85    In mid October 1996 a further undated letter signed “M. Booth” was received by Mr Staehli. In that letter the author stated that he wished the investors from whom he acquired the November 1996 $2 call options “not to suffer loss”. Accordingly, he instructed Ord Minnett and the trustee of the cash management fund to pay all of the monies in his cash management account as recommended by the Australian Securities Commission. 
     
      
    86    The Crown accepted an obligation to establish that Mr Hannes was “Booth” beyond reasonable doubt. Her Honour, as I will set out below, directed the jury in these terms on a number of occasions. This was, from one perspective, a necessary part of the Crown case. A number of acts constituting the actus reus of the offences - the instructions to acquire the securities and the applications for bank cheques - were carried out by a person identifying himself as “Mark Booth” or “M. Booth”. 
     
      
    87    In certain respects the Crown referred to the identity of Mr Hannes as “Booth” as if it were an intermediate fact, which was an indispensable link in a chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt in the sense described by Dawson J in Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 579. That may be appropriate with respect to some of the acts performed by “Booth”. In critical respects, as I have noted, the proposition that acts were done by Mr Hannes in the name of “Booth” was not an intermediate fact. In those respects the acts constituted an essential component of the actus reus of the offence. 
     
      
    88    At the trial, and on the appeal, the Appellant abjured any suggestion that there was a person called “Mark Booth”. The Appellant did state in his Record of Interview, which was before the jury, that he may have invoked the name “Mignon Booth”, his sister’s married name, for whose benefit he intended the investment to be made. Documents were signed, or purported to be issued, in the name of “M. Booth”. Witnesses who had conversations with a person purporting to be “Booth”, recalled the use of the name “Mark”, which was recorded in contemporary documents. 
     
      
       
      The Appellant’s Case 
       
      
    89    The Appellant did not give evidence at the trial. Some explanation was given in the form of a Record of Interview between Mr Hannes and two officers of respectively, the Australian Securities Commission and of the Australian Federal Police. Further material was contained in the evidence of Mr Moss, the Managing Director of Macquarie Bank Limited, who recounted a conversation with the Appellant.  
     
      
    90    The key points that emerged were as follows: 
     
      
    · The Appellant had entered into an investment syndicate with another person. Each would put in funds and the monies would be invested in securities (AB276-277; AB3743-3744). 
     
      
    · The other member of the syndicate was described as an English friend, whom the Appellant would not name (AB276-277; AB3743). He was “quite sophisticated and quite wealthy” (AB3771). 
     
      
    · The arrangements for transactions on the part of the investment syndicate was that the friend would make the investments after consultation with the Appellant (AB3750). 
     
      
    · In breach of the obligation to consult, the syndicate partner had made an investment in TNT without the Appellant’s knowledge (AB277; AB3750). 
     
      
    · The friend had asked him to obtain about $100,000 in cash and subsequently had asked him to obtain bank cheques for the Ord Minnett Cash Management Trust. (AB3747; AB3749; AB3757). 
     
      
    · The friend had no special knowledge with respect to TNT (AB277; AB3750). 
     
      
    · When the Appellant indicated that he was upset that he had not been consulted beforehand about the investment, the syndicate partner indicated that he would reverse the transaction (AB3750). 
     
      
    · Subsequently when allegations of insider trading became public the Appellant and his syndicate partner agreed that all the monies would be returned (AB3751). 
     
      
    · The Appellant indicated that he had “agreed with him that I would not reveal his identity unless it was necessary and I may not adhere to that, but at the moment that’s what I’m going to do” (AB3752). 
     
      
    91    With respect to the circumstances in which he came to withdraw a number of small amounts from his own account, the Appellant said in his Record of Interview: 
     
      
       
        
        “I went to see the - my bank, which is the Commonwealth Bank in Roseville and filled out a withdrawal slip for $100,000 cash … 
        
       
       
        
        I took it to the lady at the counter and asked for a cash withdrawal. She laughed and she said they don’t have - they didn’t even have $10,000 on the premises. I learnt something about banking. She said there is no bank in Sydney that would have that - that would give me - that would give me a cash withdrawal of that amount. So I said, ‘What should I do?’” (AB3748) 
        
       
      
    92    The Appellant then indicated: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think I rang the Wynyard branch and the woman there said, yes, they could get that amount of cash if I gave them something like two weeks notice. 
        
       
       
        
        And so I asked her what she recommended I do and she said ‘I suggest you’ll have to go to a whole series of branches to get that amount of money out in cash’ and so that’s basically what I’ve proceeded to do.” (AB3749) 
        
       
      
    93    The Crown led evidence in response to this case of the Appellant with respect to the availability of cash. It called the branch manager and three officers of the Roseville branch of the Commonwealth Bank, a supervisor and two tellers. They gave evidence that they did not recall receiving a request on 5 or 6 September 1996 from a customer seeking to withdraw $100,000. The branch manager indicated that any such request would have been directed to him or to the supervisor (who in turn gave evidence that she had no recollection of such a request). The branch manager indicated that if such a request had been made other branches of the bank would have been contacted and arrangements made for the customer to go there to collect cash. One of the bank tellers said that if she had received a request for $100,000 in cash she would have forwarded it to either the manager or the supervisor but would not have advised the customer to go to Wynyard. 
     
      
    94    The Crown called the manager of the Commonwealth Bank, Wynyard branch, together with the teller supervisor from that branch, the Operations Supervisor and, two Customer Service Operators. The manager indicated that in September 1996 incoming phone calls would go to the area of the office staffed by the Operations Supervisor and the two Customer Service Operators. The manager indicated that he did not recall receiving a request for $100,000 in cash in September 1996. If such a request had been made it would take two days to get the amount depending on what day of the week it was. He indicated that there were no restrictions on the drawing of that amount of cash, but such request would be referred to a supervisor and to him. He indicated that he would not recommend the customer go to several branches to obtain similar amounts. The teller supervisor at Wynyard said she did not receive a phone call with a request for $100,000 in cash. She indicated that she would not suggest to someone to go to other branches and take out smaller amounts. The operations officer and the two customer service operators who occupied the area of the office to which, the manager indicated, an incoming phone call would be diverted, said that they did not recall, and in one case denied, receiving a request from any person for $100,000 in cash.  
     
      
    95    No explanation was offered by Mr Hannes for obtaining a number of bank cheques from different bank branches. The Record of Interview records: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Why did you not just make out one bank cheque? 
        
       
       
        
        A I honestly don’t know, I could not - I don’t know why I did that. Maybe he said - maybe he said get bank cheques, $9,000, I don’t know. Maybe I did if off my own bat, I really - I mean, I’m not sure …” (AB3796) 
        
       
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    96    The amended grounds of appeal consist of eight numbered grounds. However, almost every ground has numerous paragraphs and sub-paragraphs many of which contain alternative formulations, and alternatives within alternatives, in the respective paragraphs and sub-paragraphs. Without attempting a precise calculation, there are probably in excess of 100 identifiably different grounds of appeal each said to constitute either an error of law or a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    97    The primary thrust of the grounds of appeal is directed to her Honour’s summing-up, to which I will refer below. There are, however, a number of specific additional matters the subject of appeal. 
     
      
    98    The Appellant asserts that there was a risk of a non-consensual verdict with respect to the insider trading charge. This, it was said, arose when the jury indicated on the eighth day of its deliberations that it had been unable to reach a unanimous verdict on that count and the trial judge then gave a direction. After a further day and a half of deliberation application was made on the Appellant’s behalf to discharge the jury but that was refused.  
     
      
    99    The Appellant appeals from the decision of the trial judge to reject the tender of certain written impressions, detected by mechanical process, on the document alleged by the Crown to be the Appellant’s notebook, comprising part of MFI 95. 
     
      
    100    The Appellant also appeals from her Honour’s rejection of a draft report of a stockbroker at Macquarie Equities Limited forwarded to a member of the Macquarie Corporate Finance Project Tennis Team.  
     
      
    101    The Appellant also challenges the trial judge’s decision to admit into evidence three items of evidence: handwriting opinion evidence; photo boards and identification evidence particularly by two witnesses; and evidence of certain conversations held in the absence of the Appellant. 
     
      
    102    The Appellant also relied on two grounds - Grounds 7 and 8 - which, in large measure, depended on matters also relied upon as defects in the summing-up. Ground 8 asserts that the trial judge permitted the Crown to present a version of its case which was not presented in the indictment and the particulars as provided. Ground 7 asserts that the conviction was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, because it was not open to the jury to be satisfied of the Appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt and a reasonable jury must have had a reasonable doubt about the Appellant’s guilt. This is the ground which used to be referred to as the ‘unsafe and unsatisfactory ground’. It is of particular significance on the issue of whether or not the Court should direct a verdict of acquittal or order a new trial. 
     
      
    103    It is not necessary to set out all the permutations of the separate grounds of appeal, some of them interconnected and others cumulative, directed at alleged defects in the summing-up. The principal matters are the following: 
     
      
       
      (i) The giving of a  
      Weissensteiner 
       direction (Ground 4.5). 
       
       
      (ii) The direction given by her Honour that it was “irrelevant” if “another person was involved” (Ground 4.1). 
       
       
      (iii) Alleged defects in the directions on the “possess information” element of the insider trading count (Ground 2.1). 
       
       
      (iv) Alleged defects in the directions on the “not generally available” element of the insider trading count (Count 2.2). 
       
       
      (v) Alleged defects in the directions on the ‘materiality’ element of the insider trading (Count 2.3). 
       
       
      (vi) Alleged defects in the directions on the two FTRA counts (Ground 3). 
       
       
      (vii) The direction concerning expert evidence (Ground 4.3). 
       
       
      (viii) The direction concerning identification evidence, both in terms of the general direction as to its unreliability and her Honour’s response to a question from the jury on this evidence (Grounds 2.2 and 2.4) 
       
       
      (ix) Failure to adequately direct the jury with respect to the control documents used for purposes of the handwriting opinion evidence (Ground 6.3). 
       
      
    104    The Appellant also relied on certain general grounds of appeal based, in large measure, on the cumulative effect of specific matters referred to above: 
     
      
       
      (i) Inadequate directions concerning the elements of the offences (Ground 1.1(a) and Grounds 2.1.2, 2.2.2 and 2.4(a)). 
       
       
      (ii) Inadequate explanation of how the law applied to the facts (Ground 1.1(b)). 
       
       
      (iii) Inadequate directions as to the circumstantial nature of the Crown case, failure to identify the inferences for which the Crown contended and failure to relate those inferences to the elements of the offences (Ground 1.1(c)). 
       
       
      (iv) Absence of a concise, accurate and understandable analysis of and summary of the evidence and, specifically, of the arguments put for the Appellant (Ground 1.1(d)). 
       
       
      (v) Lack of balance and a failure to fairly and adequately put the defence case (Ground 1.2). 
       
      
    105    With respect to the lastmentioned ground, namely, the alleged lack of balance and failure to fairly put the defence case, in addition to a general assertion of that character, this is said to be a defect with respect to a number of matters about which specific complaint is made: “possess information” (Ground 2.1.2(d)); “not generally available” (Ground 2.2.2(d)); ‘materiality’ - particularly the expert evidence (Ground 2.3.2); and the FTRA counts (Ground 3.3(b)). 
     
      
    106    It has long been established that it is not appropriate to subject a summing-up to an excessively fine analysis. In particular, it is not appropriate to do so without reference to the context of the trial, including the detailed submissions that have been made by the Crown and the representative of the accused immediately before the summing-up. As will be seen, some of the grounds of appeal and the detailed written submissions trespass on these principles. 
     
      
    107    As Lord Alverstone CJ said in Stoddart’s case (1909) 2 CrAppR 217 at 246 said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Every summing-up must be regarded in the light of the conduct of the trial and the questions which have been raised by the counsel for the prosecution and for the defence respectively. This Court does not sit to consider whether this or that phrase was the best that might have been chosen, or whether a direction which has been attacked might have been fuller or more conveniently expressed, or whether other topics which might have been dealt with on other occasions should be introduced. This Court sits here to administer justice and to deal with valid objections to matters which may have led to a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    108    This passage was referred to with approval by Street CJ in R v Sorlie (1925) 25 SR (NSW) 532 at 539 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The practice of subjecting a summing up, after the trial is over, to a minute and detailed textual criticism in the hope of finding something on which to base an argument cannot be too strongly discouraged. Such a practice does not in my opinion assist in the proper administration of justice, and this Court was not called into existence to wrestle with exercises in mental ingenuity of that kind. It exists for the purpose of rectifying injustice where there has been a miscarriage of justice, and it is important to bear in mind that the Legislature has expressly provided that, notwithstanding that it may be of opinion that the points raised on appeal might be decided in the appellant’s favour, it may nevertheless dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.” 
        
       
       
      See also  
      R v Casey 
       (1926) 26 SR (NSW) 189 at 193. 
       
      
    109    The observations of Windeyer J in Jones v Dunkel (1958-1959) 101 CLR 298 at 314 are particularly apt: 
     
      
       
        
        “It has often been said that to examine a summing-up, sentence by sentence, in search for a fault, is not the right way to see whether the judge put the case to the jury fairly and adequately. So much depends upon what counsel said in their addresses; upon incidents in the course of the trial, the significance of which at the time, and their apparent impression upon the jury, the transcript cannot reveal. So much, too, depends upon the judge’s view of what guidance the particular jury should have in the particular case; upon how far he may think it unnecessary to go over matters on which counsel addressed; or, on the other hand, on how far he may think he should bring into sharper focus matters which counsel blurred. And much depends on how far he may think it desirable, after advocacy is spent to redress the balance. On top of all this, the summing-up has to be given promptly at the conclusion of the trial, without the opportunity for careful composition which a reserved judgment may get.” 
        
       
      
    110    A number of authorities are collected in a joint judgment of Stable and W Campbell JJ in the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Ives [1973] QdR 128 at 133-135. Furthermore, the principles are restated in the joint judgment of the Western Australian Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Hong Jus Ten and Eng Chin Ei an unreported judgment of 6 November 1973 (the relevant extract of which is set out in full in Connell v The Queen (No 6) (1992) 12 WAR 133 at 252-253) where their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the touchstone for the judgment of a Court of Criminal Appeal must reside in the answer to the question whether or not there has been a miscarriage of justice, and this question obviously must be answered by considering what was said, or, as complained of here, what was not said, in the context of the particular facts of the particular case under review. The question cannot be answered by a ‘minute and textual criticism’ of the summing up or without regard to the addresses made by each counsel to the jury which preceded it. … The cases reveal a uniform approach. In the present case the judge’s summing-up followed full, and if we may say so, competent addresses by each counsel in the course of which all the evidence thought to be relevant on each side was canvassed. In this context having regard to the fact that the trial lasted for 13 days it would seem to us to be quite unreal to submit the summing up to a minute examination for the purpose of showing that certain evidence was not adverted to, or that the significance of certain evidence was not, or the lack of it was not, drawn to the jury’s attention. As we have already said, the end question as it arises under this ground was whether there has been a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    111    Although these authorities indicate the general approach, nevertheless the summing-up, in its context, must give a fair and balanced set of directions to the jury. Specifically, the jury must be fairly directed to the matters raised in defence. As Gibbs CJ said in Cleland v The Queen (1982) 151 CLR 1 at 10: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear in a principle that a trial judge, when directing a jury in a criminal trial, must hold an even balance between the cases of the prosecution and the accused and must fairly direct the consideration of the jury to the matters raised by the accused in his defence.” 
        
       
      
    112    Furthermore, a six judge joint judgment of the High Court said in Domican v The Queen (1991-1992) 173 CLR 555 at 560-561: 
     
      
       
        
        “In a criminal trial, the distinction between directions on matters of law and directions on matters of fact or argument is fundamental. A trial judge is bound to direct the jury as to any principle of law or rule of practice applicable to the case, and a misdirection or non-direction on such a matter will usually mean that the trial has miscarried. But matters of fact and the arguments in relation to them are in a different category. A trial judge is not bound to discuss all the evidence or to analyze all the conflicts in the evidence, and, by itself, the failure of a trial judge to do so does not mean that there has been any miscarriage of justice. Section 405AA of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900 (NSW), which came into force after the trial of the appellant, provides that a judge of the Supreme or District Court need not summarise ‘the evidence given in a trial’ if he or she is of the opinion that in all the circumstances a summary is not necessary. Nevertheless, the requirement of fairness means that ordinarily the respective cases for the prosecution and the accused must be accurately and fairly put to the jury. But that requirement does not oblige the judge to put to the jury every argument put forward by counsel for the accused. This Court has said that it ‘is hardly necessary to say that as a reason for granting a new trial, after a conviction in criminal case, it is not enough that the presiding judge has not mentioned to the jury all the matters which were set up on behalf of the accused as affecting probabilities’. Whether the trial judge is bound to refer to an evidentiary matter or argument ultimately depends upon whether a reference to that matter or argument is necessary to ensure that the jurors have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the evidence to discharge their duty to determine a case according to the evidence. Consequently, the conduct of the case necessarily bears on the extent to which the judge is bound to comment on or discuss the evidence. Discussion or comment which is justified or required in one case may be neither required nor justified when a similar case is conducted in a different way.” 
        
       
      
    113    More recently, a four judge joint judgment of the High Court said in RPS v The Queen (2000) 74 ALJR 449 at [41]-[42]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[41] … The fundamental task of a trial judge is, of course, to ensure a fair trial of the accused. That will require the judge to instruct the jury about so much of the law as they need to know in order to dispose of the issues in the case. No doubt that will require instructions about the elements of the offence, the burden and standard of proof and the respective functions of judge and jury. Subject to any applicable statutory provisions it will require the judge to identify the issues in the case and to relate the law to those issues. It will require the judge to put fairly before the jury the case which the accused makes. In some cases it will require the judge to warn the jury about how they should  
        not 
         reason or about particular care that must be shown before accepting certain kinds of evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        [42] But none of this must be permitted to obscure the division of functions between judge and jury. It is for the jury, and the jury alone, to decide the facts. As we have said, in some cases a judge must give the jury warnings about how they go about that task. And, of course, it has long been held that a trial judge may comment (and comment strongly) on factual issues. But although a trial judge  
        may 
         comment on the facts, the judge is not bound to do so except to the extent that the judge’s other functions require it. Often, perhaps much more often than not, the safer course for a trial judge will be to make no comment on the facts beyond reminding the jury, in the course of identifying the issues before them, of the arguments of counsel.” 
        
       
      
    114    At the time of the trial s405AA of the Crimes Act 1900 provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “405AA(1) A Judge of the Supreme Court or District Court need not summarise, at the end of a criminal trial before a jury, the evidence given in the trial if the Judge is of the opinion that, in all the circumstances of the trial, a summary is not necessary.” 
        
       
       
      This section has now been re-enacted with slightly different wording as s99(1) of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
       1986.  
       
      
    115    Before her Honour, the parties agreed that this was an appropriate case in which the whole of the evidence did not need to be summarised. Nevertheless, her Honour did refer to the evidence at different stages of her summing-up. First, when she outlined the particular elements of the offence, she referred to some of the evidence. Secondly, she made reference to some of the evidence in the context of summarising the Crown case and submissions. Thirdly, she made reference to the evidence relied upon by the Appellant in the course of summarising the submissions of Mr Robberds, who appeared for the Appellant at the trial. 
     
      
    116    The requirements of a summing-up in this respect were stated by this Court, referring to a long line of earlier authority, in R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at 105: 
     
      
       
        
        “A summing-up should, in every case, not only include directions as to the ingredients of the offence which the Crown has to establish and an explanation of how the relevant law may be applied to the facts of the particular case, but it should also include a collected resume of the evidence which relates to  
        each 
         of those ingredients and a brief outline of the arguments which have been put in relation to that evidence. … This is a rule which appears increasingly to be ignored by trial judges. It is not a compliance with that rule simply to read the relevant part of the section to the jury and then to read out the evidence which has been given chronologically, starting with the first witness and going through the evidence in chief, the cross-examination and then re-examination of each witnesses before turning to the next witness and so on. The idea of a summing-up is to present to the jury the issues of fact which they have to determine.” 
        
       
      
    117    This approach continues to apply after the adoption of s405AA(1). As Hunt CJ at CL said in R v Piazza (1997) 94 ACrimR 459 at 459-460: 
     
      
       
        
        “The section was inserted in the  
        Crimes Act 
         late in 1990, by Act 74 of that year, following repeated criticisms by this Court of trial judges who apparently believe that they were obliged to read out to the jury the evidence which had been given chronologically, starting with the first witness and going through the evidence in chief, cross-examination and then the re-examination of each witness before turning to the next witness and so on, and who also apparently believe that by doing so they had presented to the jury the issues of fact which they had to determine. 
        
       
       
        
        Subsection (1) of s405AA relieve trial judges of any such perceived obligation to summarise all of the evidence. In truth, there never was such an obligation. The obligation has always been, and remains, that to which I have already referred, to present to the jury the issues of fact which they have to determine, and to do so with such reference to the facts of the case as is necessary to assist them in that task."" 
        
       
       
      The  
      Weissensteiner 
       Direction 
       
      
    118    Her Honour gave the jury directions as to the use to which they could put the fact that the Appellant did not give evidence.  
     
      
    119    Her Honour commenced this part of her directions by referring to the fact that the record of interview with the Appellant was in evidence and, although it had not been tested by cross-examination and was not sworn evidence, it was evidence which they were obliged to take into account. 
     
      
    120    Before she gave the Weissensteiner direction, her Honour directed the jury expressly that there may be reasons unknown to them why the accused does remain silent, even if he would otherwise be in a position to contradict or explain the evidence (AB2221). At the commencement and at the conclusion of the direction, her Honour emphasised (see AB2222 and AB2224) that an accused person is presumed to be innocent; that the burden is always on the Crown to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt; that an accused is entitled to remain silent and that the jury cannot draw an inference of guilt from the accused’s silence.  
     
      
    121    Her Honour’s direction referred to the fact that the Crown had presented a body of circumstantial evidence, which she had earlier identified. Her Honour stated that there were only three respects in which the accused’s silence could be taken into account, being three inferences which the Crown asked the jury to draw: first, that there was no syndicate partner, secondly, that Mr Hannes was “M. Booth” and thirdly, that Mr Hannes knew of the prospective take-over. There is a substantial overlap between the first and second of these matters. It was the second, i.e. that “Hannes is Booth”, that the Crown expressly accepted an obligation to establish beyond reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    122    With respect to these three matters, her Honour set out in summary form the circumstantial evidence said by the Crown to entitle the jury to draw each inference and then said at AB2223-2224: 
     
      
       
        
        “The prosecution says that the evidence is in itself sufficient to draw an inference of guilt because there is no other rational explanation consistent with innocence, it demonstrates that the accused has personal knowledge of the events in question and suggests that only the accused and nobody else can provide an innocent explanation. 
        
       
       
        
        If you were to accept what I have just said to you you may take the accused’s silence into account, for the sole purpose of drawing inferences otherwise available on the prosecution case, more safely. The operative words Members of the Jury are those last words ‘more safely’. I repeat, if you accept what I have just told you, you may take the accused’s silence into account for the sole purpose of drawing inferences. The critical thing about that is it is the sole purpose of drawing inferences, is - you cannot and I remind you you cannot draw any inference of guilt, because the accused has remained silent. 
        
       
       
        
        I repeat that the accused is presumed innocent and is entitled to remain silent. The burden of proving the charges beyond reasonable doubt remains at all time with the prosecution. As I said, you could only take into account the accused’s silence for the sole purpose of drawing inferences which the Crown would - the Crown says are otherwise available on the prosecution case, more safely, but I re-emphasise to you Members of the Jury, that you cannot draw any inference of guilt because of his remaining silent.” 
        
       
      
    123    Her Honour had in mind the provisions of s20(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “20(2) The judge or any party (other than the prosecutor) may comment on a failure of the defendant to give evidence. However, unless the comment is made by another defendant in the proceeding, the comment must not suggest that the defendant failed to give evidence because the defender was, or believed that he or she was, guilty of the offence concerned.” 
        
       
      
    124    Her Honour also had in mind and, indeed, was bound by, the authority of the High Court in Weissensteiner v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217, which authorised a direction of this character. However, subsequent to her Honour’s direction in this case, the High Court handed down judgment in RPS v The Queen supra which restricts the circumstances in which a direction of this character will be appropriate.  
     
      
    125    There are difficulties in reconciling, in all respects, the reasoning and decisions in Weissensteiner and RPS. The High Court has heard argument in two cases which raise these difficulties. Nevertheless, at this stage, this Court must proceed on the basis that it is bound by both Weissensteiner and RPS.  
     
      
    126    The majority joint judgment in RPS acknowledges that there are circumstances in which a direction of this character is appropriate in a criminal trial, albeit the circumstances are to be more narrowly confined than may have been the practice in this State prior to RPS.  
     
      
    127    In a joint judgment, Gaudron ACJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said at [27]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it will seldom, if ever, be reasonable to conclude that an accused in a criminal trial would be expected to give evidence. The most that can be said in criminal matters is that there are some cases in which evidence (or an explanation) contradicting an apparently damning inference to be drawn from proven facts could come only from the accused. In the absence of such evidence or explanation, the jury may more readily draw the conclusion that the prosecution seeks. As was said in  
        Weissensteiner v The Queen 
         [(1993) 178 CLR 217 at 227-228 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ]: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘[I]n a criminal trial, hypotheses consistent with innocence may cease to be rational or reasonable in the absence of evidence to support them  
          when that evidence, if it exists at all, must be within the knowledge of the accused.’ 
           (Italics added.)” 
          
         
        
       
      
    128    Their Honours also distinguished Weissensteiner in the following way at [35]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The present case (and cases of a similar kind) must be contrasted with that considered by this Court in  
        Weissensteiner 
        . There the prosecution case was that the accused’s guilt was to be inferred from circumstances, particularly the unexplained disappearance of those whom it was alleged he had murdered, and his possession of the boat and equipment which they owned and from which they had disappeared whilst on a voyage with the accused. The majority of the Court held that the trial judge in that case had made no error by directing the jury that they could more safely draw the inferences which the prosecution alleged should be drawn ‘when the accused elects not to give evidence of relevant facts which could be easily perceived to be in his knowledge’ [178 CLR 224] but as Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ pointed out in  
        Weissensteiner 
         [at 228]: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Not every case calls for explanation or contradiction in the form of evidence from the accused. There may be no facts peculiar within the accused’s knowledge. Even if there are facts peculiarly within the accused’s knowledge the deficiencies in the prosecution’s case may be sufficient to account for the accused remaining silent and relying upon the burden of proof cast upon the prosecution. Much depends upon the circumstances of the particular case and the jury should not be invited to take into account the failure of the accused to give evidence unless that failure is clearly capable of assisting them in the evaluation of the evidence before them.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        And as the other members of the majority in  
        Weissensteiner 
         [at 237-238] (Brennan and Toohey JJ) said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The facts from which an inference of guilt may be drawn are correctly identified [in the charge to the jury] as facts which the prosecution is able to prove. The use to which the appellant’s failure to give evidence may be put is correctly restricted to a strengthening of an inference of guilt from the facts proved. And the jury is told not to use the appellant’s failure to give evidence unless relevant facts ‘can be easily perceived to be in his knowledge’. This additional requirement which follows a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Queensland in  
          R v Winfield 
          , ensures that the drawing of an inference of guilt will not be assisted by an accused’s failure to give evidence unless it is reasonable to expect some denial, explanation or answer by the accused to the prima facie case made against him.’ ” 
          
         
        
       
      
    129    In R v Fowler [2000] NSWCCA 142, Wood CJ at CL considered the implications of RPS upon the practice in this State of making a Weissensteiner direction. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        [159] “It remains possibly open to argument that a  
        Weissensteiner 
         direction should only ever be contemplated in a ‘smoking gun’ case, or to a circumstantial case dependent on inference from proved facts, the  
        innocent explanation for which 
         might only reasonably lie in the mouth of the appellant … 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [163] … The occasion for such a [ 
        Weissensteiner 
        ] direction in my view must hereafter be confined to an exceptional case of the kind there involved, where the line of reasoning in question is compelling. 
        
       
       
        
        [164] The present case was not to my assessment of that kind, particularly having regard to the circumstances that answers had been provided by the appellant in relation to at least some of the matters in his unsworn statement, that as to others his evidence could not have risen above a denial, and that tactical reasons were apparent to all as to why the appellant may have wished not to give evidence that were unassociated with fear of incriminating himself for the offence of murder for which he was on trial.” 
        
       
      
    130    The decision in Weissensteiner was applied by this Court in R v OGD (1997) 45 NSWLR 744. In RPS at [30] the High Court doubted that OGD stood for a “general proposition” that a direction should be given “in cases like the present” - which encompassed sexual assault cases in which the accused does not respond to the complainant’s evidence. The joint judgment in RPS expressly rejected any such “general proposition” referring, with approval, to Gleeson CJ’s emphasis in OGD at 752, on the need for caution in giving such directions. 
     
      
    131    The passage in OGD to which the High Court referred with approval in RPS concerned the existence of multiple charges, a circumstance on which the Appellant relies in this case. In OGD there were ten charges of homosexual intercourse with a specific male person under the age of 18 years and one charge of sexual intercourse without consent, also with respect to the specified person. In his reasons for decision, Gleeson CJ emphasised (at 747E) the significant difference between the first ten charges and the eleventh charge, turning on the absence of 
     
      
      consent for the last charge. His Honour said at 748A-B: 
       
       
        
        “If one were to search for a possible explanation of the appellant’s failure to give evidence there is, to my mind, one distinct possibility. It is that the appellant, if he had sought to defend himself against the final charge by asserting that the complainant consented to sexual relations, or that he did not know the complainant was not consenting, would have been forced to make admissions in relation to the other charges.” 
        
       
      
    132    His Honour concluded that the appellant’s dilemma in this regard emphasised the need for caution in making directions of this character (752F-G). The direction actually given did not distinguish between the different charges and was “dangerous and unfair” (753D). 
     
      
    133    In terms of the three specific matters to which the direction given in this case referred, there is no element distinguishing the insider trading charge from the FTRA charges, in the patent way that occurred with the issue of consent in OGD. Two of the three matters the subject of the direction do not arise in the FTRA charges - “no syndicate partner” (expressed in that form) and knowledge of the takeover. However, the use of the name “M. Booth” with respect to the bank cheques, overlaps with the use of that name in relation to the Ord Minnett accounts. There does not appear to be any material difference between these two situations. 
     
      
    134    The Appellant merely contended that, like OGD, there were multiple counts. However, no submission was made distinguishing any one of the three counts from the others. One possibility arises from the fact that count 2, the FTRA withdrawals charge, does not turn on the proposition that “Hannes was Booth”. There is, for example, a theoretical possibility that Mr Hannes could not give evidence to identify “Booth”, or otherwise establish that he did not know what shares his syndicate partner intended to invest in, without running the risk of admitting that he had, at least, collaborated in an evasion of the FTRA. However, in all the circumstances such a differentiation appears artificial in the extreme. 
     
      
    135    Plainly, the charges had different elements. However, no attempt was made to proffer any reasonable explanation for refusing to give evidence on one count rather than the others. In my opinion, unlike OGD, there was no relevant distinction between the charges of a character which rendered the Weissensteiner direction, if otherwise appropriate, unfair. 
     
      
    136    The primary submission of the Appellant in this regard, was that the circumstances of this case were not such as to constitute an exceptional case in which a direction of this character is permissible. The Crown submitted to the contrary. It is necessary to look separately at each of the three matters with respect to which her Honour directed, and confined, the jury in this regard. 
     
      
    137    The first matter referred to was that the jury could more safely draw the inference that “there is no syndicate partner”. There was no submission that this negative proposition was not material and distinct from the inference that “Hannes was Booth”. It is not entirely clear on what factual basis the Crown relied to ground the inference expressed in this negative form. One such consideration could have been the failure of Mr Hannes to identify the syndicate partner in the record of interview. Perhaps the Crown also relied on the evidence that “Booth” was an entirely fictitious character: there was no person of that name at contact points he nominated such as the Intercontinental Hotel; when asked for passport identification, he had forgotten to bring it; when asked for a tax file number, he said he was just applying for one. 
     
      
    138    In the context of the circumstantial case advanced by the Crown, the existence of a syndicate partner was a fact on the basis of which the jury could accept the existence of a hypothesis consistent with innocence, i.e. that the unidentified syndicate partner may have purchased the options. 
     
      
    139    The circumstance that a jury has in evidence the accused’s version of the facts, often by an unsworn record of interview, may constitute a reason for refusing to draw the conclusion that an accused would be expected to give evidence. Wood CJ at CL took such a proposition into account in this way in Fowler supra at [164].  
     
      
    140    However, in the present case the earlier revelations in the record of interview and the evidence of Mr Moss, had a particular characteristic. This was the refusal on the part of the Appellant to identify the syndicate partner or identify any fact, matter or circumstance which might suggest his existence. This refusal was maintained throughout the trial in circumstances in which the Appellant was at risk, a risk which eventuated, of imprisonment for a substantial period.  
     
      
    141    The statement he made in the record of interview was to the effect that he had agreed in late 1996 with a person, whom he would not name, to form an investment syndicate to which each would subscribe half the money. According to the Appellant, the arrangement was that the other party would make the investments but would consult the Appellant in advance. He said that after the options had been bought in TNT he had been informed by his syndicate partner that this had occurred. This caused Mr Hannes to become upset because he had not been consulted beforehand. The syndicate partner agreed to reverse the transaction. 
     
      
    142    In my opinion, the content of the record of interview is not of a character which would put before a jury anything other than the mere fact of the alleged existence of a syndicate partner. It is not evidence of a quality which detracts from an expectation that the accused in this case would give evidence. The identification of the syndicate partner is, in my opinion, of a sufficiently exceptional character to create an expectation that an accused would at least give some evidence to identify him or identify some other objective fact, matter or circumstance from which the existence and role of such a person could be inferred. On the submissions made in this Court, evidence on this matter could come from only two sources, the Appellant and the alleged syndicate partner. In the absence of any evidence from the latter, evidence in support of that proposition could come only from the accused. It was, in my opinion, of a sufficiently exceptional character to justify a direction of the kind which her Honour made. 
     
      
    143    The second inference which her Honour directed the jury they could draw more safely by reason of the failure of Mr Hannes to give evidence, was the proposition that “Hannes is Booth”. There was some overlap with the first proposition, in the sense that if there was a syndicate partner, then that laid the foundation for an inference that some or all of the acts conducted in the name of “Booth” were conducted by that syndicate partner. Nevertheless, the inferences were, and are, conceptually distinct. 
     
      
    144    As noted above, with respect to this second inference to which the direction related, the Crown had accepted that it had to establish the proposition beyond reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    145    With respect to the insider trading charge, the accounts in which the options were bought and funded were opened and conducted in the name of “Booth”. The first element of the relevant offence - namely that the Appellant had purchased securities - could not be established on the Crown case unless the acts of “Booth” were found to have been performed by the Appellant. With respect to count 3 the same proposition was true of the bank cheques obtained in the name of “Booth”. 
     
      
    146    The decision in RPS emphasises that great caution needs to be displayed before giving a Weissensteiner direction. That must be particularly so with respect to an inference as critical to the Crown case as was the inference that “Hannes was Booth”. I note that the Appellant did not, in this Court, submit that the direction constituted in some way a ‘suggestion’ of guilt, contrary to the second limb of s20(2) of the Evidence Act (c/f RPS at [20]). 
     
      
    147    Each of the two majority judgments in Weissensteiner states that there are circumstances in which it is appropriate to use the silence of an accused to support an inference of guilt. The directions given by the trial judge in Weissensteiner were expressly in such terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “[The prosecution] asks you to  
        infer guilt 
         from a whole collection of circumstance. It asks you to draw inferences from such facts as it is able to prove.  
        Such an inference 
         may be more safely drawn from the proven facts when an accused person elects not to give evidence of relevant facts which it can easily be perceived must be within his knowledge.” (224 and 237 emphasis added)  
        
       
       
      and 
       
       
        
        “… [the prosecution] seeks to have you  
        infer guilt 
         from such facts as it is able to prove to your satisfaction.  
        Such an inference 
         may be more safely drawn from the proven facts when the accused elects not to give evidence of relevant facts which can be easily perceived to be in his knowledge.” (224 and 237 emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    148    These directions were upheld by the majority (at 230-231 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ; 237-238 per Brennan and Toohey JJ). The minority would have restricted the scope of the permissible inference to drawing an inference from unexplained facts more safely, not extending to an inference of guilt from the whole Crown case (at 242-243, 246, 247 per Gaudron and McHugh JJ). This Court is bound by Weissensteiner to accept that a direction can encompass an inference as close to an inference of guilt as was, in this case, the proposition that “Hannes was Booth”. 
     
      
    149    In this case the trial judge’s direction was not to the effect that there was an inference of guilt. Her Honour, on the application of the Crown, confined the directions to certain specific inferences of fact, even though one of them - the equation of “Hannes was Booth” - was essential in the sense that an element of the insider trading offence could not be made out, on the Crown case, unless the inference were drawn. 
     
      
    150    In her summing-up the trial judge gave directions on the first two, overlapping, but not equivalent, inferences in the one passage as follows (AB2222-2223): 
     
      
       
        
        “Now the prosecution submits that these inferences may be more safely drawn, because of the following, and this relates to the first two matters which I have referred you to, that is that there is no syndicate partner and that Mr Hannes is Mr Booth. Firstly, the prosecution submits that these inferences may be more safely drawn because no syndicate partner has been identified and only Mr Hannes can identify him. Secondly, there is no such person as Mark Booth. Thirdly the Booth handwriting is that of Mr Hannes and fourthly the Booth indentations are in three of Mr Hannes’ notebooks. Four, that the Booth documents are on the Hannes computer. That Alexi Voltraint is fictitious and connected with Hannes via the writing, the diary and the book club evidence. Sixthly, Mr Hannes admits obtaining cheques in the name of M Booth and signing for them, that is a reference to the record of interview, p57 to 68 and also the Crown relies on the bank photo evidence, which is exhibit EE.” 
        
       
      
    151    In the case of the existence or non-existence of a syndicate partner the nature of the explanation that was called for - beginning with the identification of a person - was clear. This is not, however, so with respect to the second inference - that “Hannes was Booth”. I find her Honour’s directions difficult to follow in this second respect. 
     
      
    152    The sentence commencing “Firstly” with the reference that “only Mr Hannes can identify” the syndicate partner, is an appropriate direction with respect to the inference that “there is no syndicate partner”. It is not clear what, if any, of the other matters set out in this passage are intended to relate to this first inference. 
     
      
    153    The balance of this direction gives the appearance of an abbreviated list of facts and circumstances on the basis of which the Crown asserted that the two inferences could be drawn. What the jury required, however, was guidance as to what evidence called for explanation by Mr Hannes, in the absence of which they could draw either inference “more safely”. 
     
      
    154    The reference to “only Mr Hannes can identify him” is, in my opinion, sufficient with respect to the first inference. 
     
      
    155    However, with respect to the inference that “Hannes was Booth”, her Honour’s direction to the jury consisted of a mixture of matters only some of which could be said to have necessarily called for evidence on the part of the accused.  
     
      
    156    In the passage quoted above, the last two matters referred to an admission that Mr Hannes obtained cheques in the name of “Booth” and a reference to the photo evidence in exhibit EE. These are not matters which, on their face, called for any explanation or evidence from the Appellant.  
     
      
    157    It is not clear to me what her Honour intended to convey by the second proposition to which her Honour referred: “there is no such person as Mark Booth”. Presumably it is a reference to the body of evidence that no person of that name was found, at or by reference to, any of the places at which he purported to reside or be contactable - the Intercontinental Hotel, the mailbox, the voicemail. This negative evidence called for no explanation by the Appellant who never contended that there was a person called “Mark Booth”. 
     
      
    158    With respect to the third matter, namely the proposition that the “Booth” handwriting is that of Mr Hannes, it is difficult to know what evidence Mr Hannes could have given other than a denial.  
     
      
    159    The position may be different, however, with respect what her Honour refers to as the “Booth indentations” in Mr Hannes’ notebooks and the existence of “Booth” document on Mr Hannes’ computer. These are matters which, to some degree, may have called for an explanation, but whether they were so exceptional as to satisfy the RPS test is another matter. 
     
      
    160    Finally, the propositions that “Alexi Voltraint” is fictitious and connected with Mr Hannes via the writing in the diary and the book club evidence - which relate to the false address given for “Voltraint” - are matters which could have called for some form of explanation, but not necessarily on the RPS test. 
     
      
    161    It is not entirely clear how the jury would have construed her Honour’s directions in this respect. It is likely that they were accepted as a list of matters, summarising her Honour’s earlier directions on the Crown circumstantial case, on the basis of which the inference could be drawn, being the inference that the Crown said could be drawn more safely by reason of the failure of the accused to give evidence.  
     
      
    162    Encompassed within these propositions are a number of matters with respect to which it could be said that the accused alone could offer an explanation, e.g. the “Booth” indentations in the notebooks found beside his bed and on his desk and the existence of the “Booth” documents on the accused’s own computer. However, the trial judge gave no indication to the jury as to which of the matters in this list were of a kind that the accused would be expected to give evidence about. This contrasted with the reference to the first inference - the existence of a syndicate partner - where the proposition her Honour put to the jury was that the inference could be more safely drawn “because no syndicate partner has been identified and only Mr Hannes can identify him”. There is no equivalent guidance with respect to the notebooks, the computer or the diary. The other matters referred to could not, in my opinion, have qualified under the RPS test. 
     
      
    163    No attempt was made by the Crown in its written and oral submissions in this case to identify each of the matters about which it was submitted the accused could have given evidence so as to indicate why, in respect of each such matter, the case was so compelling that an explanation by the accused was called for in accordance with the strict test laid down in RPS. The Crown approached this matter on the basis that the relevant inference was of a higher level of generality, namely the equation between “Booth and Hannes”. However, with respect to an inference at that level of generality, the only evidence that Mr Hannes could have given was a denial. In my opinion, it is necessary to analyse with care the evidence that the Appellant could have given with respect to the individual facts and matters on the basis of which the Crown submitted the inference could be drawn. In the light of the strict test required by RPS, I do not believe the direction given can be supported.  
     
      
    164    What was required was some specification of the particular evidence which could come only from the accused. The point of a direction of this character is to indicate to the jury a permissible course of reasoning, and, significantly, to stress the impermissible form of reasoning to which a jury may be prone, without direction. In view of RPS, it is not, in my opinion, sufficient to say that a jury may draw an inference more safely without some specification and restriction, by the trial judge, of the particular evidence with respect to which the absence of an explanation is of sufficiently compelling character.  
     
      
    165    This may have been the case in the present situation with respect to the notebooks and the computer and, possibly, the diary. No attempt was made to direct the consideration of the jury in this way. Indeed, the jury was instructed that the failure of the accused to give evidence generally, rather than with respect to specific identified matters, was such as to establish a basis for an inference that “Hannes was Booth”. In my opinion this direction was in error. 
     
      
    166    The third inference which was the subject of the Weissensteiner direction was “that Mr Hannes knew of the prospective take-over”. This was a matter which went to the element of the offence that the Appellant “possessed” the particularised “information”. Her Honour also set out a summary of what she had already indicated to the jury earlier in her summing-up were the facts and matters on which the Crown relied as a basis for the drawing of the inference. In this respect, her Honour restricted herself to the proposition that the relevant inference of fact could be drawn more safely by reason of the failure of the Appellant to give evidence. 
     
      
    167    In my opinion, this particular matter does not satisfy the RPS test of a matter about which the Appellant could be expected to give evidence in a criminal trial. At the particular level of generality at which the proposition was expressed in the directions - that “Mr Hannes knew of the prospective take-over” - it is not readily apparent what evidence Mr Hannes could have given, other than a general denial or some form of explanation as to the limited quality of the information about that general subject matter of which he had become aware at a relevant time.  
     
      
    168    In one sense, the state of a person’s knowledge is always peculiarly within that person’s knowledge and, accordingly, can be seen to satisfy the requirements for a direction of this character. However, in the present case that is not the only source of information on this matter. The Crown relied on the circumstances: the late night visits by Mr Hannes to the premises of MCF where documentation was accessible. However, there was also actual direct evidence of communications between Mr Hannes and other employees of MCF working on the take-over itself, e.g. with Mr Hancock. 
     
      
    169    There are observations in RPS which suggest that the reasoning involved in the process of drawing inferences in the absence of an explanation, may not be applicable to a case based on direct evidence and not on circumstantial evidence. (See e.g. RPS supra at [23]). It is not necessary to decide whether or not such a differentiation is either required by RPS or should be drawn. It is sufficient for present purposes to conclude that with respect to the question of Mr Hannes’ knowledge about the prospective take-over, this was not a matter of a character about which it could be said that evidence “could come only from the accused” (RPS at [27]). 
     
      
    170    Her Honour’s error in making a Weissensteiner direction with respect to the inference that “Hannes was Booth” directly affects both count 1, the insider trading charge, and count 3, the FTRA bank cheques charge. However, the finding that “Hannes was Booth” was also directly relevant to count 2, the FTRA withdrawals charge. The conclusion that “Hannes was Booth” would have affected the jury in its consideration of whether Mr Hannes made the withdrawals for the proscribed “dominant purpose” of ensuring that there was no reportable cash transaction. Accordingly, the appeal should be upheld with respect to all three charges on this basis. 
     
      
    171    The centrality of the issue of “Hannes being Booth”, and the significance of the “possess information” element for the insider trading charge, make it inappropriate to apply the proviso. 
     
      
       
      Direction re - “Another person involved” 
       
      
    172    The Appellant submitted that her Honour had erred in acceding to the request of the Crown to give the jury a direction concerning the relevance of the proposition that another person was involved in the commission of the offences. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The direction that I give you Members of the Jury is this, that it is quite irrelevant that another person, on Mr Robberds’ scenario turns out to be involved, if it is established that the elements of criminal liability are established against Mr Hannes, even if some other person is involved, criminally or not. So that is the direction that I give you in relation to that matter.” (AB2133) 
        
       
      
    173    Subsequently, her Honour reiterated this direction, again at the request of the Crown: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I told you that I would remind you of the direction I had given you regarding the involvement of another person and that is this, the Crown does not have to establish that no other person was involved. It is quite irrelevant that another person on Mr Robberds’ scenario turns out to be involved. If it is established that the elements of the criminal liability are established against Mr Hannes, even if some other person is involved criminally or not.” (AB2270) 
        
       
      
    174    The Appellant objected to the directions on a number of different bases: 
     
      
    · It represented a fundamental shift in the Crown case at a time when the Appellant had no proper opportunity of responding to it. 
     
      
    · It related to, or was capable in the minds of a reasonable jury of relating to, the central issue of the case as to whether or not there was another person who committed the acts which constituted the actus reus of the offences. 
     
      
    · Her Honour failed to relate this direction to the elements of the offences, the evidence and issues at the trial or to the directions that were made with respect to other matters. 
     
      
    175    The determination of questions of fact is a matter for the jury. It is not appropriate for a trial judge to indicate that a jury ought not have regard to evidence for any such purpose. As Moffitt AJA said in R v Guerin [1967] 1 NSWR 255 at 273: 
     
      
       
        
        “A judge is entitled to express his opinion of any of the facts provided he makes it clear to the jury that it is their province to decide the matter. Even if he does so, however, there are limits as to how far the judge should go … . In some cases a judge may properly feel it is his duty, acting judicially, to express his opinion and in others, acting judicially, not to express his opinion, but if he does he should not use such language as leads the jury to think that he is directing them that they must find the facts the way that he indicates … . Whether he expresses an opinion may depend on the conduct of the trial, including what counsel say in their addresses, and consequently the judge who presides at the trial (and he alone is fully seized of these matters) has a wide discretion. If some matters have not been really contested it may well be not only proper, but in the interests of bringing the jury to the substantial issue in the case, for the trial judge to indicate to the jury that they should not have much difficulty in finding various matters.” 
        
       
      
    176    In the present case the matters to which objection is taken on appeal, as quoted above, are expressed in terms of a “direction”. They are not and do not purport to be an expression of opinion as to findings of fact open to the jury. In my opinion, the primary issue that arises on this ground of appeal is whether or not there was a risk that the trial judge’s directions would be seen by the jury to have been a direction on an issue of fact. 
     
      
    177    The problem arises because of the use of the word “irrelevant”. This word is curt and all-encompassing. It suggests that the jury should put this matter entirely out of its mind for any purpose. The subsequent reference to “if it is established that the elements of criminal liability are established against Mr Hannes”, may not have been understood as words which strictly limit the circumstances of ‘irrelevance’. 
     
      
    178    The most important issue of fact in the case was whether or not “Hannes was Booth”. It was an essential aspect of the Crown’s case that certain critical acts performed in the name of “Booth”, by a person purporting to be of that name, were in fact acts performed by Mr Hannes. If there was any real risk that the jury understood the trial judge’s direction to the effect that it was “irrelevant” that another person was “involved”, as requiring the jury to ignore some piece of evidence capable of being weighed in the balance by them in determining this basic issue, then there can be no doubt that the trial has miscarried. 
     
      
    179    On its face, the direction does not purport to be a direction with respect to facts. It purports to be a direction with respect to the law. The reference to the relevance of the involvement of another person is related to the proposition “if it is established that the elements of criminal liability are established against Mr Hannes”. As a proposition of law, this is correct and the Appellant did not challenge it. The issue is whether or not there was any real risk that the direction could have been understood to go beyond a direction of law in this sense. 
     
      
    180    It is of significance that Mr Hannes was represented by very experienced counsel at trial who did not object to the direction on the basis now under consideration in this Court. That in itself is indicative that there was unlikely to be misunderstanding on the part of the jury. Nevertheless, it is necessary to look at the whole of the circumstances in order to assess whether or not a risk of the relevant character could be said to exist. 
     
      
    181    The first occasion on which the direction was given was towards the beginning of her Honour’s summary of the submissions made on behalf of the defence. It was to these submissions that her Honour would have been understood by the jury to be referring when she mentioned “Mr Robberds’ scenario”. Her Honour had said on the previous page that the first proposition in the defence case was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Robberds told you that it is the Accused’s case that he did have a syndicate partner and that that person does exist. He told you that for the purposes of these submissions he would call him Mark Booth. His submission to you was that it was Mark Booth and not the Accused who purchased the November $2 options.” (AB2132) 
        
       
      
    182    The subsequent passage in which the ‘irrelevance’ direction was given commenced with her Honour saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “The first matter that Mr Robberds took you to was this question of the existence of another person. What I am going to do now Members of the Jury is to give you a direction in relation to this question of whether or not there were two people involved. You may or may not recall that the Crown raised that this was a possibility in his opening address, pointing out to you that there - well he pointed out to you that so long as the elements of criminal liability could be established against Mr Hannes, then any involvement, criminal or otherwise, of another person does not affect Mr Hannes’ liability.” (AB2133) 
        
       
      
    183    The second occasion on which her Honour made the direction was in response to a question from the jury with respect to simultaneous phone calls, namely the evidence that on 27 September 1996 a call was made on Mr Hannes’ mobile phone at precisely the same time as someone obtained access to the voicemail of the account opened by “Booth”. Her Honour outlined the various arguments of the Crown which could explain the purported overlap in time between the two calls. It was in that context that her Honour repeated her earlier direction. 
     
      
    184    At the trial, the first reference to the formulation “no other person involved” occurred in Mr Robberd’s address to the jury, towards the conclusion of which he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In order to accept the Crown case, the Crown has to satisfy you, beyond reasonable doubt that there was no other person involved and for the reasons which we gave to you in detail the other day we submit that there is a reasonable doubt about this …” (AB1885 line 30) 
        
       
      
    185    Counsel proceeded to refer to some of the points that he had made in greater detail the previous day. He specifically mentioned the evidence of two witnesses, Mr Brear and Ms Wilkins, who gave the description of a person who attended upon them as having a crewcut; the fact that twelve important calls were not made on Mr Hannes’ mobile phone; the existence of two simultaneous phone calls on 27 September; and the evidence of another witness, Mrs Pollard, that the person with whom she dealt was not the same as the photograph of Mr Hannes in the newspaper. After summarising these points, Mr Robberds concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “… so that is a brief summary of the reasons why we submit that the Crown will not satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt that there was no other person involved.” (AB1885 line 52) 
        
       
      
    186    On two occasions, counsel for the Appellant told the jury that the Crown bore an onus of establishing that “there was no other person involved”. 
     
      
    187    This submission on behalf of the Appellant evoked the following response from the Crown at AB1894 line 1: 
     
      
       
        
        “The submission made this morning that the Crown must establish that no other person was involved is quite misleading and I opened on this basis your Honour. The Crown doesn’t have to establish that no other person was involved, the Crown has to establish that Mr Hannes was himself criminally involved. If it turns out that he had a partner who was criminally involved or not criminally involved it makes no difference and I don’t want to get into questions of joint criminal liability Mr Robberds seems bent on it.” 
        
       
      
    188    The Crown reiterated its position at AB1902 lines 6-20: 
     
      
       
        
        “I come to this proposition about a submission was made that repeatedly the two people were involved with the suggestion that this would exclude the liability of Mr Hannes. It makes no difference … so long as Mr Hannes’ criminal liability is established in respect of him transacting the purchases with Mr Staehli it makes no difference if somewhere or another lurking in the background, he had a syndicate partner involved or not involved, that is to say criminally or otherwise.” 
        
       
      
    189    I emphasise one part of this Crown submission - “so long as Mr Hannes’ criminal liability is established in respect of him transacting the purchases with Mr Staehli”. I note that the reference in her Honour’s direction to establishing “the elements of criminal liability” did not specifically identify the continuing necessity to establish that the Appellant purchased the options, i.e. “transacting the purchases with Mr Staehli”, to use the terminology of the Crown submissions. 
     
      
    190    The proposition originally advanced to the jury by counsel for the Appellant was a legal proposition, to repeat: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the Crown has to satisfy you, beyond reasonable doubt that there was no other person involved …” 
        
       
      
    191    Her Honour was entitled to give the jury a direction of law that the Crown was not subject to any such obligation. However, the terminology her Honour adopted in this respect employed the word “irrelevant”. The issue is whether in doing so her Honour went beyond correcting the error of law in the address by counsel for the Appellant. 
     
      
    192    The Appellant submitted that the direction with respect to “another person involved” constituted a fundamental shift in the Crown case at a time when the Appellant had no proper opportunity of responding to it. However, as her Honour said in the course of her summing-up, and as the Crown reiterated in this Court, the Crown had opened with the proposition that if it turned out that some other person was involved, even criminally, this did not make a difference so long as the elements of liability asserted by the Crown against Mr Hannes were established. The direction of which complaint is made does use such terminology.  
     
      
    193    The Crown made it clear throughout its submissions that it was Mr Hannes, using the persona “Mark Booth”, who purchased the securities and that it was also Mr Hannes who acquired the bank cheques. There was not, in my opinion, any change in the Crown case in this respect. 
     
      
    194    The obligation assumed by the Crown to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the critical acts performed in the name of “Mark Booth” were in fact performed by Mr Hannes, was referred to by her Honour on a number of occasions.  
     
      
    195    Early in her directions to the jury her Honour explained that she would identify the essential elements of the insider trading charge and relate the evidence to those elements. Her Honour commenced with the first element being that the accused purchased securities, namely 5,000 $2 November 1996 option contracts. With respect to that first and basic element - that it was the accused who effected the purchase - her Honour described the Crown case in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown case is that Mr Hannes purchased those 5,000 contracts, the two dollar November options, between 17 and 20 September 1996 in the name of M Booth.” (AB2016) 
        
       
       
      Her Honour reiterated the point: 
       
       
        
        “… the Crown case is that Mr Hannes purchased those two dollar options using a false name, M Booth.” (AB2016) 
        
       
      
    196    Her Honour went on to indicate the degree to which the Crown regarded the identity between Mr Hannes and “Booth” as essential to its case in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown has accepted that as part of its reasoning, in fact an indispensable step in respect of this offence, is that Mr Hannes conducted those transactions as Mr Booth, and that is put in issue by the defence. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown must satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Hannes is Mr Booth. If the Crown has established to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Hannes is Mr Booth, I suggest that you would not be troubled in concluding at that point that Mr Hannes purchased those option contracts.” (AB2016-2017) 
        
       
      
    197    After her Honour’s outline of the elements of the offence, immediately before turning to the elements of the offences under the FTRA, her Honour summarised the position in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “So, members of the jury, you need to be satisfied in respect of each of those elements beyond reasonable doubt, and right at the forefront of what I have said in respect of each of those elements is that the Crown has got to satisfy you that Mr Hannes is Mr Booth, and that beyond reasonable doubt.” (AB2084) 
        
       
      
    198    With respect to the third count in the indictment, namely the purchase of the bank cheques, her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “So members of the jury, you have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused Mr Hannes was the person who entered into the transactions, that is each of the nine transactions which are particularised in the indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown case is that Mr Hannes purchased those cheques, using a false name, that is the name of M Booth and again you will need to be satisfied by the Crown that the person referred to as Mr Booth is in fact Mr Hannes.” (AB2096) 
        
       
       
      (A subsequent correction to this direction is not material for present purposes.) 
       
      
    199    The point was reiterated in the context of the jury turning to the mental element of the FTRA offences, when her Honour commenced her remarks with the observation: 
     
      
       
        
        “… if you have been satisfied by the Crown that Mr Hannes is Mr Booth …” (AB2106) 
        
       
      
    200    When her Honour came to summarise the submissions made on behalf of the Crown, her Honour commenced with the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown submitted to you that Mr Hannes is Mr Booth and once you reach that point, which he submitted to you one reaches in a couple of very short steps in this case, that Mr Hannes is Mr Booth, it is really a couple of more short steps to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in respect of each of the offences. He submitted to you that Mr Hannes is the person M Booth who transacted not only the purchase of the bank cheques but transacted the purchase of the options from Mr Staehli, he opened the mail box and did all of those other things in the name of M Booth or Mark Booth.” (AB2122-2123) 
        
       
       
      and 
       
       
        
        “The Crown case is that the Accused, Mr Hannes, used a false name, false identity of M Booth or Mark Booth, spent the $90,000 buying $2 November call options in TNT …” (AB2123) 
        
       
      
    201    When her Honour came to summarise the Crown submissions with respect to the FTRA counts her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the Crown has submitted that in respect of the insider trading the Crown has established its case in respect of each of the elements contained in that offence and that of course includes establishing that Mr Hannes is indeed the person Mr Booth.” (AB2131) 
        
       
      
    202    In the context of giving the Weissensteiner direction her Honour made a further reference to this issue in that one of the inferences which could be more safely drawn, by reason of the absence of evidence, is that “Mr Hannes is Mr Booth” (AB2222). 
     
      
    203    Her Honour’s references to this matter in the context of the Weissensteiner direction occurred after the first direction concerning the ‘involvement’ of another person was given to the jury. 
     
      
    204    It is also material to note, that after both directions now complained of were given to the jury, the jury asked a further question seeking a definition of reasonable doubt. In the context of answering that request, by reiterating the standard of proof, her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown must satisfy you, you the jury, beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused by establishing each of the essential ingredients of the charge to that standard.” 
        
       
      
    205    The critical issue, in my opinion, is whether the direction, albeit framed as one of law, could have been understood by the jury to constitute a direction with respect to a finding of fact on one of the matters which constituted, or was relevant to, element of the offences, specifically with respect to the insider trading charge, the purchase of the securities and, with respect to the second of the FTRA counts, the acquisition of the bank cheques.  
     
      
    206    In the light of the frequent reiteration of the Crown case that “Hannes was Booth”, I do not believe that the jury would have had any confusion that they had to find Mr Hannes purchased the securities and acquired the bank cheques. Nevertheless, the terminology employed that it was “irrelevant” that “another person was involved”, was capable of misleading. There may have been a possibility that it suggested to the jury that the evidence, such as it was, of ‘involvement’ - whatever that ambiguous term may have been taken to mean - was not evidence that they should take into account or give weight to in determining some issues of fact. 
     
      
    207    In this respect, of particular significance is a passage in her Honour’s first direction to the jury (AB2133-2134), where her Honour sought to explain the purpose for which she had given the direction. She did so by referring to the submissions of Mr Robberds concerned with the fundamental issue of whether or not “Hannes was Booth”.  
     
      
    208    Towards the beginning of these submissions by Mr Robberds, after noting that the accused’s case was that he did have a syndicate partner, Mr Robberds had addressed the jury in the following terms (AB1789 line 39-44): 
     
      
       
        
        “Now does Mark Booth exist. I want to address you on the question of whether the Crown has proved whether the accused syndicate partner exists. This question was addressed by the Crown with a submission that the accused is Mark Booth, which in effect meant that he did not have a syndicate partner.” 
        
       
      
    209    Her Honour plainly regarded this submission as pertinent to the direction she gave on the ‘irrelevance’ of the ‘involvement’ of another person. Immediately after the first occasion on which her Honour gave the direction she said the following at AB2133-2134: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now I will take you to those - that part of Mr Robberds’ submissions where you may recall that he framed his submissions in terms of putting matters to you and then asking you as it were, ‘does Mark Booth exist’ and that is why I have given you that direction at this point of time. Mr Robberds went on to say to you, ‘I want to address you on the question of whether the Crown has proved whether the accused’s syndicate partner exists’ and reminded you that the question was addressed by the Crown with a submission that the accused is Mark Booth, which in effect means that he did not have a syndicate partner. So again I just make it clear that that is the reason why I have given you the direction at this point of time on the question of the involvement of another person.” 
        
       
      
    210    As can be seen, her Honour referred to the earlier submission of Mr Robberds on the issue expressed by him in terms of the Crown proving some element. The submission was not clearly expressed and the infelicity of language is repeated in her Honour’s direction. However, it is, in part, by reason of that submission that her Honour explains the need for the direction which she has given. 
     
      
    211    Considering the summing-up as a whole, in the context of the submissions made, I conclude that there was little risk that this direction would have confused the jury on the issue of whether Mr Hannes committed the key acts in the name of “Booth”. 
     
      
    212    However, two other factual issues before the jury may have been confused by the bluntness of the terminology employed in this direction. The Crown asked the jury to find that there was no syndicate partner. Indeed, this was one of the three inferences about which the Crown successfully sought a Weissensteiner direction. 
     
      
    213    The Crown also contended that “Hannes was Booth” and successfully sought a Weissensteiner direction in those terms. That proposition went beyond what was necessary for the Crown to prove its case: namely, that Mr Hannes was the person who acquired the bank cheques and purchased the securities. The contention was that every act done in the name of Booth was done by Mr Hannes and, indeed, that there was no such person as “Mark Booth”, and no syndicate partner. 
     
      
    214    Considerations of this kind are the foundation of the Appellant’s submission that there was a fundamental shift in the Crown case. The Appellant’s submissions do not identify how the case would have been differently presented if this “fundamental shift” had not occurred. In any event, the Appellant did not challenge the suggestion that the legal proposition to similar effect had been referred to by the Crown in its opening. The prejudice, in my opinion, was not to the presentation of the defence case. There may have been prejudice, however, by confusing the jury. 
     
      
    215    Whether or not another person was “involved” - in the sense of whether or not a person other than Mr Hannes had any interest in the investment in TNT options or had taken any step in the process of investing - was plainly relevant to the two issues posed by the Crown: “there was no syndicate partner” and “Hannes was Booth”, insofar as the latter proposition went beyond the acts of Booth that constituted part of the actus reus of the offences. Although her Honour qualified her direction that any involvement was “quite irrelevant” by saying that it was irrelevant “if … the elements of criminal liability are established against Mr Hannes”, there was, in my opinion, a risk of confusion. 
     
      
    216    Some of the “elements” of criminal liability against Mr Hannes were, in the context of this case, said to be established in part on the basis of the lack of “involvement” or another person, i.e. “no syndicate partner” and “Hannes was Booth”. The direction has a circularity which a jury could well have found confusing. 
     
      
       
      Elements of the Insider Trading Offence 
       
      
    217    Towards the commencement of her summing-up to the jury, her Honour gave directions to the jury based on a structure of four elements of the offence: 
     
      
       
      (i) Purchase by the Appellant (at AB2015-2018). 
       
       
      (ii) Possessed of information that was not generally available (at AB2019-2025). 
       
       
      (iii) Materiality (at AB2025-2026). 
       
       
      (iv) The mental element (at AB2026-2029). 
       
      
    218    In this Court, the Appellant’s submissions proceeded on the basis of distinguishing, as separate elements, the issue of “possession of information” and the issue of “general availability”. Her Honour had introduced the relevant part of the summing-up by combining these two factors when she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I move on to tell you about the second element in this offence, and that is that the accused was possessed of information that was not generally available.” 
        
       
      
    219    Her Honour quoted to the jury the definition of “information” found in s1002A(1). Her Honour also quoted to the jury the definition of “generally available” in s1002B(2). 
     
      
    220    In terms of identifying the information for the purposes of what her Honour was then dealing with, i.e. both issues of “possession” and of “general availability” her Honour first described the information in general terms as: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the information that the Crown relies on here is the information relating to the possible take-over of shares in TNT.” (AB2019) 
        
       
      
    221    Her Honour went on to identify the information precisely in accordance with the particulars supplied by the Crown at AB2019-2020: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown case is that there was a prospect that shares in TNT would be the subject of a take-over and that there was a prospect that the offer would be at a price in excess of $2 per share. The Corporate Advisory Division of Macquarie Corporate Finance was advising TNT in connection with that possible take-over, and it placed securities in TNT on an embargo list. That is the way the Crown particularised the information with which Mr Hannes was alleged to possess, which information which was not generally available. That is to say that was information, that information was not in the market place.” 
        
       
      
    222    Thereafter although her Honour made a number of references to aspects of the take-over and to “information” her Honour did not again reiterate in full the particulars as supplied. The Appellant submitted that her Honour’s failure to subsequently refer the jury to the specific “information” particularised was a defect in the summing-up. 
     
      
    223    The summing-up was, necessarily, a long one. The jury needed to keep prominently in mind, the specific “information” which it had to find beyond reasonable doubt, to satisfy the various respects by which the “information” must exist in a number of elements. It would have been preferable if they had been reminded of the particulars more than once. On its own, I would not have been prepared to find that this failure constituted an error of law. However, it reinforces the conclusion I have drawn on the basis of other grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      “Possessed Information” 
       
      
    224    At AB2019 and following, her Honour addressed what she described as the second element in the offence, namely, “that the accused was possessed of information that was not generally available”. To some extent her Honour dealt separately with the issue of “generally available”, though the evidence did overlap in this respect. As noted above, the submissions in this Court addressed the question of “possession” separately from that of “general availability” and it is convenient to do so. 
     
      
    225    Her Honour referred to the evidence on which the Crown relied in this respect, evidence to which the jury had recently been taken in the addresses of counsel in some detail. This included the evidence of directors and employees of Macquarie Bank and, particularly, of MCF. Her Honour referred to the evidence that MCF was retained to advise TNT and described generally the functions they performed in this respect. She referred to documents that had been brought into existence in connection with this retainer. She referred to these documents being “accessible in the offices of Macquarie Corporate Finance”. Her Honour also noted, what the Crown said were admissions made by Mr Hannes in his record of interview and in his conversations with Mr Moss. The ‘admissions’, to which her Honour would later take the jury in some detail when summarising the respective cases, were admissions relating to the state of knowledge of Mr Hannes. 
     
      
    226    In the course of summarising the evidence pertinent to this particular element of the offence, her Honour emphasised (AB2024 and AB2025), that the defence disputed that the Appellant “had any knowledge of a possible takeover of TNT”.  
     
      
    227    The Appellant submitted that the trial judge’s direction to the jury in this respect were open to the interpretation that it was sufficient if the Appellant “knew something about Tennis”, the MCF codename for the TNT retainer, and that it was enough for the Crown to prove that the Appellant merely had access to the internal documentation. The Appellant also submitted that the trial judge did not direct the jury as to the meaning of “possessed information”. He submitted that the jury should have been specifically directed that this concept contained an element of awareness so that a mere physical relationship, e.g. the existence of a document in the same office, would not be sufficient. It was further submitted that in the light of her Honour’s summing-up, the jury may not have comprehended the difference between the mere existence of the Information and the Appellant’s alleged possession of it. 
     
      
    228    Reading the summing-up as a whole, I have no reason to doubt that the jury understood perfectly well that they had to find, to use the Appellant’s terminology, an ‘awareness’ of information and that there was a distinction between the mere existence of certain information in the offices of Macquarie Corporate Finance and whether or not that information came to the knowledge of the Appellant.  
     
      
    229    There was no direct evidence that the Appellant ever had the internal documentation in his possession. Nevertheless, there was a considerable body of evidence about the accessibility of that information in the offices of MCF. The evidence of late night visits by the Appellant to his office was directed to establishing that there were occasions on which the Appellant could have availed himself of the opportunity of accessing the documentation without members of the team working on the project knowing about it.  
     
      
    230    There was direct evidence of the Appellant’s awareness. Mr Murdoch, a member of the Tennis team, gave evidence of a conversation with the Appellant. He said that in the week preceding 15 July 1996, Mr Hannes approached him and asked “What valuation have you come up with” referring to TNT. Mr Murdoch responded by informing him that the range was between $2.25 and $3.27.  
     
      
    231    Furthermore, in his record of interview Mr Hannes said that he knew “there was this transaction going on for TNT”. Mr Moss gave evidence that Mr Hannes said that he knew that the Corporate Advisory Division was “working on a possible acquisition of TNT” (AB279 line 25) 
     
      
    232    The course of the Crown’s submissions made it perfectly clear to the jury that the Crown case was that Mr Hannes had actual knowledge of the information as particularised and that that knowledge was, to a substantial degree, based on access to MCF information, including that contained in internal documentation.  
     
      
    233    After referring to Mr Murdoch’s evidence, the Crown addressed the jury in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “And what does that tell us about Mr Hannes’ knowledge. Well he knew about ‘Tennis’ he knew a valuation was being done. He knew that Mr Murdoch was working on the valuation. He knew the valuation was high, maybe very high and maybe most importantly, he was interested to know and he got a response, $2.25 to $3.27 … what has happened here is that Mr Hannes has chosen the most junior member of the team, the business analyst to ask about the valuation. Once again, when all the circumstances of the case are looked at together, there is nothing particularly innocent or accidental about this conversation and it puts Mr Hannes in a position of knowledge of what’s going on with the valuation.” (AB1734 lines 35-55) 
        
       
      
    234    Earlier the Crown had indicated this to the jury in the context of what it submitted was covert action by Mr Hannes in employing the pseudonym “Booth”: 
     
      
       
        
        “Members of the jury the Crown would and does say to you that that says a great deal about his state of knowledge about what was going on in [Macquarie] Bank. He was doing this secretly so that he could get away with it as it were, but a false identity of M Booth.” (AB1724 lines 55 to 58). 
        
       
      
    235    The Crown also told the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “Let’s just recap for a moment on what we’ve proved directly in respect of Mr Hannes’ knowledge. He knew that investing in TNT securities was against the rules. He knew that there was working going on for TNT. He knew that there was a takeover in this transaction as he said in the record of interview. He referred to this transaction or the acquisition in his conversation with Mr Moss. He knew there was a valuation. He knew Mr Murdoch was working on it. He knew the valuation was high - $2.25 to $3.27. He was probing for information. He acted alone and not through some investment syndicate as he said. He knew as we’ve heard already that TNT Securities were on the embargo list. He signed a piece of paper on 16 July which confirms that. He knew who was on the team. He knew that Mr Murdoch was doing the valuation or was working on the valuation. He knew the fee was high. … He knew that large fees were being charged. He knew about the state of the nation. … By inference, members of the jury, through the material that I’ve you through - and we say that that material that I’ve taken you to directly, including the admissions, goes to establish the crown case and more but we say by inference that Mr Hannes from the material I’ve taken you to in respect of the documents available and the late night visits and what one infers from all of the circumstances including the trade itself that Mr Hannes actually put himself in a position to know everything that he needed to know about the TNT takeover. I won’t take you through the documents again but we had the project tennis valuations of 11 and 12 July. We had the update of 15 July. We had Mr Poole’s files that were available, Susan Martin-Rousselot’s files, Mr Murdoch’s files, the late night visits we’ve been through, access to the computer, access to the library, the purchase themselves of the $2 call options in circumstances that this would be quite irrational otherwise. I think you’d accept, members of the jury, that the effect of the evidence is that Mr Hannes is a careful type of person … [h]e’s a careful type of person, not the kind of person who’s going to throw away $90,000. So we have direct evidence and evidence by way of the drawing of inferences from what occurred and you are entitled to reason in that way. You’re entitled to reason from the use of the false identity that he did so because he was in a state of knowledge.” (AB1762 line 11, AB1763 line 10). 
        
       
      
    236    The Crown directed the jury’s attention to the specific elements of the offence including the element of “possess information”. It identified precisely the particulars, as supplied, to constitute “the information that we say Mr Hannes was possessed of” (AB1771 line 41). 
     
      
    237    In this context the Crown referred to the evidence about “whether or not Mr Hannes had information” (AB1773 line 50) and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it is the Crown case that to buy $2 call options for November you would have to have very specific knowledge because as Mr Smith said they’re just a waste of money if you buy them without that information.” (AB1773 line 52-56) 
        
       
      
    238    The Crown returned to the issue of “what Mr Hannes knew” and outlined the evidence again: 
     
      
       
        
        “You’ve heard that he was an executive director of the very bank advising TNT; that he himself was experienced in takeovers; he knew all about project tennis and the fact that there was a team working on it; asked those very specific questions and indicated a knowledge to Mr Murdoch; knew there was a big fee; admitted in the record of interview … ‘I was aware there was work going on for TNT, I never on any occasion talked to him about the work that Macquarie Bank was doing for TNT’ … 
        
       
       
        
        We see so too in respect of Mr Moss that it’s a direct admission. He knew all he needed to know, he knew all about the transaction, he knew TNT was embargoed and he signed that document on 16 July. He knew he wasn’t permitted to deal in TNT shares, he had access to, and I’ve already taken you to the evidence, he helped himself to the information that we ask you to infer on those days when he went into the bank. He made those unexplained phone calls at crucial times. I’ve already put to you that he bought the $2 call options in circumstances in which we submit it would be entirely irrational for him to do it, if he did not have inside information. He went to extraordinary lengths to conceal his actions, using false names, false documents, engaging in an elaborate charade. The documents contained on the search warrant show elaborate planning. When you put it altogether, there is only one inference to be drawn, and that inference is an inference of guilt in our submission. 
        
       
       
        
        Now that addresses the question of whether or not Mr Hannes had the information.” (AB1778 line 44, AB1779 line 18) 
        
       
      
    239    Counsel for the accused at the trial approached the case on the basis that the issue which the Crown had tendered for determination was whether or not Mr Hannes had acquired an actual state of knowledge by means of accessing documents within MCF. Mr Robberds commenced addressing the jury on this issue of ‘possessing information’ as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown case against Mr Hannes concerning knowledge is two-fold. It is alleged that he had access to the documents and I will be dealing with that further in this address and it is also alleged that as result of a number of conversations that he had with people or at meetings at which he was present he became aware of relevant details concerning Project Tennis.”  
        
       
      
    240    He indicated that, in his submission, the evidence does not “indicate that he obtained any relevant information which would give him any inside information at all”. 
     
      
    241    In the course of his submissions to the jury, Mr Robberds turned specifically to the issue of “possess information”, being information in the form of the particulars (AB1877). He referred to the evidence relied upon in this respect by the Crown and indicated that the issue was whether actual knowledge had come to Mr Hannes’ attention, inter alia, by access to documents. In the course of his submissions, Mr Robberds said: 
     
      
       
        
        “So a fundamental question which arises in the Crown case is this, are you satisfied that on 21 August when Mr Hannes visited the office of Macquarie Corporate Finance late at night he accessed the project Tennis documents and obtained information which showed that a takeover was on the cards.” (AB1878 lines 17-21) 
        
       
       
      And for reasons he indicated to the jury: 
       
       
        
        “… it follows that the Crown will have to satisfy you, in our submission, that it was on 21 August that Mr Hannes accessed the documents and obtained the information.” (AB1878) 
        
       
      
    242    In conclusion he submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        “We therefore submit to you that you will not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Hannes accessed any Tennis information when he called late on that night and we submit to you that you would not be satisfied that Mr Hannes did have information at any time that there was a prospect that shares in TNT would be the subject of a takeover, but there was a prospect that the offer would be at a price in excess of $2 per share.” (AB1881 lines 11-19) 
        
       
      
    243    It was in the context of these submissions, that her Honour came to make the relevant directions to the jury. Her Honour read to the jury the specific particulars relied upon by the Crown and immediately said: 
     
      
       
        
        “That is the way the Crown particularised the information with which Mr Hannes was alleged to possess, which information was not generally available.” (AB2020) 
        
       
      
    244    Her Honour referred to the fact that certain documents were “accessible in the offices of Macquarie Corporate Finance” (at AB2024), noting that the defence disputes the contentions in this regard (AB2024) and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “… in its defence the accused denies that he had any knowledge of a possible takeover of TNT and the accused puts in issue that a purchase of two dollar November call options on 19 September 1996 can only be explained by a purchaser having insider information.” (AB2024-2025) 
        
       
       
      And her Honour added: 
       
       
        
        “… he denies that he had any knowledge of a possible takeover of TNT and he puts in issue that a purchase of the two dollar November call options on 18 September 1996 can only be explained by a purchaser having insider information.” (AB2025) 
        
       
      
    245    In the course of her summary of the evidence, her Honour referred to the conversation with Mr Murdoch, the conversation with Mr Moss, identified the documentation located within MCF, referred to the late night visits and telephone calls to the office and also to the inference available from the fact, if the jury accepts the proposition, that Mr Hannes actually made the investment in the name of “Booth”. Her Honour noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “… what the Crown puts to you that Mr Hannes would not have entered upon this particular transaction unless he had specific knowledge.” (AB2058) 
        
       
      
    246    In the context of referring to the case for the accused her Honour said that Mr Robberds told them that they would not be satisfied that “Mr Hannes accessed the documents” or that “he did have information at any time” about the prospect of a take-over (see AB2172). 
     
      
    247    Finally, it should be noted that one of the three matters specifically referred to in the context of the Weissensteiner direction, being an inference which the jury could draw more safely, was that “Mr Hannes knew of the prospective takeover” (AB2222). 
     
      
    248    This review of the addresses to the jury, places her Honour’s summing-up in its context. There is no basis for the suggestion that the jury might have been confused in any pertinent respect. 
     
      
    249    The submission that the jury may have been confused into believing that it was sufficient if he merely “knew something about Tennis” or if the information simply existed in the offices of MCF and that the mere ability to access the documentation may have been sufficient to constitute this element of the charge, should be rejected. The submission that there was an error of law in failing to distinguish between physical possession and awareness of information should also be rejected. 
     
      
       
      “Generally available” 
       
      
    250    Her Honour read to the jury the whole of s1002B(2) on two occasions. (AB2019, 2059). She did not at any stage read to the jury s1002B(3), nor was she requested to do so by counsel representing the Appellant at trial. 
     
      
    251    As I have also noted above, her Honour read to the jury the three sentences of the particulars as supplied by the Crown. Her Honour then added: 
     
      
       
        
        “That is the way the Crown particularised the information with which Mr Hannes was alleged to possess, which information which was not generally available. That is to say that was information, that information was not in the market place.” (AB2020) 
        
       
      
    252    Her Honour outlined some of the evidence relevant to this issue and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “So the next question then is in terms of the elements, or ingredients, of this offence, is whether or not that information, the actual part of the charge, is the accused has possessed at the relevant time information that was not generally available, and in relation to those words ‘not generally available’ I have given you the definition what is provided in the Act itself as to ‘generally available information’ and what I direct you is that in that phrase that it was not generally available means that it was not, not available in the marketplace.” (AB2023) 
        
       
      
    253    Her Honour returned to the issue of general availability at AB2082-3 when she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I read you the definition in the section this morning, and I do not think that you will be troubled with the words ‘it consists of readily observable matter’, I think that is reasonably plain English. And the next matter that is provided for is (b)(i) ‘It has been made known in a manner that would, or would be likely to, bring it to the attention of persons who commonly invest in securities of bodies corporate of a kind whose price or value might be affected by the information’. That is price sensitive, that is what that means, and where would you be likely to find that out, and where would people who commonly invest in securities to find out information of a kind which may affect the price of the particular security, and that is in the market place. 
        
       
       
        
        There is the final leg to that is that since that information has been made known, that there has been a reasonable period of time for it to be disseminated, that is to become known among such persons that a reasonable period of time for that to happen has in fact taken place.” (AB2082-2083) 
        
       
      
    254    In his submissions to this Court, the Appellant identified a body of evidence which, he submitted, was relevant to the issue as to whether or not the information particularised was “generally available”. He referred to the expert evidence given, on behalf of the Crown, by Mr Smith and, on behalf of the accused, by Mr Rhead. He also referred to exhibits which were tendered in the trial which referred to contemporary brokers’ reports and newspaper articles on TNT. 
     
      
    255    It was a feature of this entire body of evidence that it did not encompass all of the material contained in the particulars as the relevant “information”. This evidence related only to the first two of the four elements namely, the possibility of a take-over and the price at which such a take-over might occur. None of the evidence to which the attention of this Court was directed focused in any way on the last two elements of the information particularised namely, the proposition that MCF had been appointed to advise TNT with respect to this matter and that Macquarie had placed TNT on an embargo list, so that Macquarie employees could not deal in the shares.  
     
      
    256    The fact that the company was seeking advice with respect to these matters and the further fact that that advice was of sufficient significance to warrant an embargo of this character, was an important part of the insider information contained in the particulars. At whatever level of probability the prospect of a take-over at a price could be seen to exist at any relevant time, these further factors increase the quality of that information in a manner which is plainly of significance. 
     
      
    257    The content of the brokers’ reports was of a character which was appropriately described in the Crown submissions as “speculative”. On this appeal these reports were treated as relevant to the issue of whether or not the information particularised had become “generally available”. No doubt if information had become “generally available” one would expect to find it in documents of this character. However, nothing in these documents went beyond market consideration of TNT’s vulnerability to a take-over, accompanied by some valuations in excess of $2 per share, in accordance with the diversity of techniques that are used by brokers to value shares. 
     
      
    258    It is not necessary to express a final opinion as to whether material of this character is at all relevant to the issue of a “general availability”. The “information” which the jury had to consider was whether or not there was a “prospect” that shares in TNT “would be the subject of a takeover” and whether or not there was a “prospect” that an offer “would be at a price in excess of $2 per share”. References in the brokers’ research were of the following character: “TNT as a take-over candidate” and “We currently value TNT at $2.20/share” (AB4546); “Takeover Value Estimated At $2.21” and “Takeover Value $2.21” (AB4689). Such references are of little, if any, assistance on the issue whether or not the information in the particulars was “generally available”. However, the evidence was before the jury without objection and the jury was entitled to give it such weight as it thought it should receive. 
     
      
    259    The Appellant submitted that her Honour erred in not directing the jury as to the meaning of the words “not generally available”. He submitted that twice reading out the definition was not sufficient. 
     
      
    260    Specifically, her Honour should have directed the jury as to the meaning of “readily observable matter”. Her Honour had said that that phrase contained ordinary English words and there was no need for any direction. The thrust of this submission was that it does not appear from the terminology of “readily observable matter” in s1002B(2)(a) as to the persons to whom the relevant “matter” should be understood as “readily observable” and as to how such “matter” should be “readily observable”.  
     
      
    261    On the issue of “to whom”, the submission made to this Court was that unlike the second limb of the definition which refers to a limited class of person, i.e. persons who commonly invest in securities, no such limitation appears in the first limb. The submission was that the relevant “matter” need only be readily observable by the public at large. 
     
      
    262    On this basis no purpose would have been served by a direction from her Honour to identify “the public at large” as the relevant group conducting the observations. If the jury proceeded on such a wide basis then, on the submissions made in this Court by the Appellant, they were entitled to do so. If they proceeded on some narrower basis, then that was unnecessarily advantageous to the Appellant. 
     
      
    263    With respect to the second aspect as to “how” the relevant “observation” was to be made, the submission was that the ordinary meaning of the words was that matter had to be “easily able to be perceived by the senses in some way”. This is also as broad a definition as one could conceive. Again if the jury proceeded on some narrower basis, then that was unnecessarily favourable to the Appellant. 
     
      
    264    I agree with her Honour that these plain English words required no elaboration on her part. 
     
      
    265    The submission was also made that the jury required further assistance with respect to the second limb of the definition. In his written submissions the Appellant submitted that the jury was not told that the “focus” of this limb of the definition was on “whether the information had been known in a particular manner”. It was then asserted that the “focus” of the “focus” was “whether or not the information has been the subject of some report or release” which would or would be likely to bring the information to the attention of persons who commonly invest in securities.  
     
      
    266    The first “focus” is no more than a paraphrase of the definition which her Honour read to the jury on two occasions. The second alleged “focus” is also a paraphrase, save in so far as it restricts the “manner” by which information has been brought to the attention of such persons to a “report or release”. No such restriction appears on the face of the statute. No restrictive direction in this regard was permissible, let alone required.  
     
      
    267    Finally, it was submitted that the jury should have been assisted by an explanation of the kinds of securities that might be affected. The Appellant’s submissions posed the question whether or not securities that might have been affected were “securities of large public companies, or large transport companies, or some other type of company”. Nothing in the section, or the circumstances of the case, suggests that any restriction to a particular category of securities was either pertinent or permissible. No issue arose in the conduct of the case that the options in question were not securities for the purposes of the application of the section in the particular context. No explanation of this character was called for. 
     
      
    268    The Appellant also submitted that her Honour erred in the references her Honour made, on at least two occasions, when identifying the general availability of information with information known in the “marketplace”. There are dangers in substituting a popular phrase for a statutory formulation, particularly if the jury is directed, as it was here, that that is the ‘meaning’ of the statutory formulation, rather than by way of example or explanation. Nevertheless, a miscarriage of justice does not automatically follow. 
     
      
    269    The first submission made in this respect was that “the ‘matter’ need only to be readily observable by the public at large, as opposed to investors in the ‘marketplace’”, and that the reference to it “bore no relationship to the first limb of the definition of “generally available”, which is not limited to the marketplace.” The availability of such information to the public at large would encompass persons described as “investors in the marketplace”. Accordingly, the submission appears to be that her Honour identified a narrower category than the statute permitted. If, without deciding, that is the proper construction of the provision, then her Honour’s directions were unnecessarily advantageous to the Appellant and there was no error of law, let alone a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    270    It was then submitted that the words “in the marketplace” were “vague and ambiguous and misleading”. If they in fact operated as words of restriction, again there would be no relevant error. This is made apparent by the Appellant’s identification of the range of possible meanings in its submissions in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Was ‘the marketplace’ the market for all shares in Australia, or the market for options or derivatives, or just the market for shares or options in companies of a similar nature to TNT.” 
        
       
      
    271    All of those matters are capable of constituting matter that is “readily observable” or as defining the scope of the phrase “persons who commonly invest in securities”. These are not alternatives which her Honour was obliged to direct the jury to consider.  
     
      
    272    This submission is of the character to which this Court referred in a joint judgment of Street CJ, McClemens CJ at CL and Slattery J in R v Holden [1974] 2 NSWLR 548 at 551F where their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The criminal law should not be complicated by refined dissections of issues that must ultimately be presented to twelve laymen for their decision.” 
        
       
      
    273    In the normal case it is inadvisable for a trial judge to substitute a different formulation for a statutory form of words, particularly when that is done not in a form of an explanation, but by way of direction as to the meaning of the word or words. Nevertheless, in the circumstances of this case where, it appears from the submissions of the Appellant in this Court, the direction had the effect of a narrowing the statutory formulation in a manner favourable to the Appellant, no error of law or miscarriage of justice of a character justifying the intervention of this Court has occurred. 
     
      
    274    The Appellant also submitted that her Honour erred in failing to specifically direct the jury’s attention to the provisions of s1002B(3) which expand the scope of information being “generally available” to “deductions, conclusions or inferences” drawn from other matter. It was submitted that this was an important aspect of the definition because part of the information in the particulars could have been deduced or inferred from the information that was available. In this respect the Appellant relied on the brokers’ reports which referred to TNT as a take-over target and submitted that it was reasonably open for the jury to conclude that this material consisted of “deductions, conclusions and inferences” which was drawn from information which was generally available in accordance with both limbs of the definition in s1002B(2)(b). 
     
      
    275    No doubt the analyses were “deductions, conclusions, and inferences” from matter that was “generally available”. However, none of it is of the character of the “information” particularised. It is not about the “prospect” that there “would be” a take-over at a price above $2. Nor, obviously, is it about the fact that TNT had appointed MCF as advisers and MCF had placed TNT shares on an embargo list. 
     
      
    276    In my opinion, the information specified in the particulars was not of the same character as that contained in the brokers’ reports. Those reports deduced from the objective circumstances of the company the possibility of a takeover. The brokers’ reports also computed, on a variety of bases, the brokers’ valuations, some of which were in excess of $2.  
     
      
    277    The “information” particularised, although it could have been more felicitously expressed in this respect, has an element of probability which is not present in any of the brokers’ reports. Both of the first sentences as to the prospect of a take-over and of the price use the word “would”. The reference to “prospect” indicates an element of indefiniteness. However, an element of “probability” rather than mere “possibility” is contained in the word “would”. This element is emphasised by the third sentence of the particulars, referring to the involvement of MCF as an adviser and the embargo list. In my opinion, nothing in the nature of the “deductions, conclusions or inferences” contained in any of the brokers’ reports suggested that it was based on information of the same character as that contained in the “information” as particularised. 
     
      
    278    In any event, even if I were wrong about the above, no complaint was made at trial for a further direction in this respect. Experienced trial counsel was of the view that the combination of his own address to the jury, together with her Honour’s reference to the evidence in this respect, was sufficient to leave to the jury such material as he wished the jury to consider on the issue of “general availability”.  
     
      
    279    I note that with respect to the third sentence of the particulars - the sentence which refers to the fact that MCF was an adviser and that it placed TNT shares on an internal embargo list - there is no evidence that anything of that character was “generally available”. This is an essential aspect of the particulars on which the Crown relied. In the absence of any suggestion that this material was in any way available, and in the face of uncontested evidence that it was not available, I would not have found there to have been any miscarriage of justice if error in this respect had been shown. 
     
      
       
      Materiality 
       
      
    280    In the section of her Honour’s judgment where her Honour was outlining the elements of the offence, her Honour identified the element of “materiality” in the relevant part of s1002G(1)(a) and read s1002C to the jury. At this point of her summing-up her Honour referred to the Crown witness Mr Smith who gave evidence on this matter. 
     
      
    281    Her Honour then went on to identify what she described as “the final element” in the offence - the mental element - and read to the jury s1002G(1)(b).  
     
      
    282    Subsequently in her summing-up, after referring to evidence which went to the issue of “possession of information” (at AB2049-2059, making a further reference to the issue of general availability at AB2059-2060), her Honour referred again to the issue of materiality, introducing a paraphrase of the definition in s1002C as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Then I wanted to say something about the evidence on this question of knowledge so far as it would influence somebody to invest or not to invest in this particular type of investment.” 
        
       
      
    283    Her Honour referred in this context to the evidence of Mr Smith and, to some extent, that of Mr Rhead at AB2060-2061. Her Honour then said at AB2061-2063: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the question of the share movements, the evidence is that when in fact the take-over took place on 1 October the fact was that the sales that occurred on that day were something like seventy million shares were sold in a matter of hours. That was after the announcement of the take-over, I should say, and that evidence is before you. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        On 2 October, in terms of volume of shares traded seventy-four million odd shares were traded. That is on the day of the announcement itself. That is the document which is exhibit ES in the trial and which you have together with all the other documents giving details in relation to the sales, not only of the shares, the options. You will remember the various options, they ran through from amounts to a dollar through two dollars fifty and they are exhibits FA1 through to, I think FA6 or could even be more than six of them. But in any event they are there for you to see the various movements both in the shares. The first list is ES, that gives you the, in fact, the dealings in the shares themselves between 2 January 1996 right up until the calender year, 30 December 1996 and the sales that have been pointed out to you during the course of the trial was as at 12 July 1996 the shares were selling for round about the dollar twenty. 
        
       
       
        
        Then when the shares at the time of the purchase of the shares by Mr Booth on 18 September 1996 the shares were then being traded around about a dollar fifty-seven, a dollar fifty-six, of that order. On 30 September 1996, that is one day before the take-over was announced they were trading at between one sixty-one and one sixty-three and you have the graphs which show the movements too.” 
        
       
      
    284    Counsel at the trial objected to her Honour’s reference to what had happened when the actual take-over occurred. He submitted that the take-over which in fact took place was irrelevant on the basis that the information that was in the marketplace on 2 October was not the information that the Crown relied upon, i.e. the particulars referring to the prospect of a take-over (see at AB2071-2072). 
     
      
    285    Her Honour later returned to the issue of “generally available” and “materiality” and provided the jury with a further paraphrase of the terms in s1002G(1)(a) and the definition of that phrase in s1002C (at AB2083). Finally, her Honour reiterated the second reference to the fact of materiality in the mental element of the offence (AB2083-2084). 
     
      
    286    Her Honour returned again to this issue, after further submissions. She again set out s1002C in full and reiterated that the first step was to identify the information which was “in the possession” of Mr Hannes, indicating that information to be the information which had to be assessed in terms of materiality. She then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… if you make a determination, as to what information that he did have available to him, then you move on and you have to have regard to the evidence, as to the quality of the information and it is then and only then that you then turn to the question of whether or not that quality of information is such that a reasonable person would be taken to expect that it would have a material effect on the price or value of the securities.” (AB2209-2210). 
        
       
      
    287    The first submission made by the Appellant in this regard was that her Honour failed to explain the requirement of materiality other than in terms of the statutory definition and in particular, it was submitted, her Honour failed to emphasise and explain the objective nature of the test for “material effect”. The statutory definition is in perfectly understandable language and, in my opinion, required no explanation in the circumstances of this case. I would also reject the submission that her Honour failed to explain or emphasise the objective nature of the test. On no less than six occasions her Honour either read or paraphrased the statutory definition in terms which employed the formulation of what “a reasonable person would expect”. The jury could have been in no doubt as to the objective nature of the test which they had to apply. 
     
      
    288    It was also submitted that her Honour erred in directing the attention of the jury to a need to assess the “quality” of the information. As noted above her Honour said that the jury, after identifying the information that was in the “possession” of Mr Hannes, should identify the “quality of the information” and then turn to the question of whether or not “that quality of information is such that a reasonable person would be taken to expect” etc. A further reference, on the next page, was to similar effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “… if you are satisfied about the quality of the material that you have found he was in possession of, then you may, or may not be satisfied that that was information of such a kind that it would have a material effect on the price or value of the securities.” (AB2210) 
        
       
      
    289    The submission made to this Court was to the effect that her Honour introduced some form of “intermediate step” requiring the jury to assess the quality of the information before applying the test of materiality in s1002C. 
     
      
    290    The issue of “quality” of the information had arisen in the course of the examination and cross-examination of the experts. Mr Smith the expert called for the Crown had given evidence that if information about a transaction which might be a take-over had been generally available, this would have had the effect of dramatically increasing the price of TNT shares (AB1520-1521). In the last question and answer of the examination in chief of Mr Rhead, the Appellant’s expert, he was asked about Mr Smith’s evidence. He was asked to agree that such information would have an effect of the character to which Mr Smith had referred. He answered: 
     
      
       
        
        “Depends on the quality of the information for openers …” 
        
       
      
    291    The issue of the quality of information was then taken up in cross-examination. (See AB1560) 
     
      
    292    In the course of the submissions by Mr Robberds on behalf of Mr Hannes, the reference to “quality of information” was expressly linked to the issue of materiality. He had earlier read the evidence of Mr Rhead to the jury (see AB1882 line 15 and AB1860 lines 12-18). 
     
      
    293    In the course of drawing an invidious comparison between the evidence of Mr Rhead and that of Mr Smith, Mr Robberds told the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Rhead correctly acknowledged that ultimately the materiality of the scenarios depends upon the quality of the information …” (AB1882 line 49-51) 
        
       
      
    294    Her Honour picked up this reference in the course of summarising Mr Robberd’s submissions and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As to the scenario put to Mr Rhead he accepted that materiality depended upon the quality of the information which the Crown submits was good.” (AB2174) 
        
       
      
    295    In this context, it does not appear to me that the jury would have been misled into approaching its task in any way other than in accordance with the statutory test, by introducing extraneous considerations into the application of s1002C to the facts of the case. The references to “quality” of information simply directed the attention of the jury to some aspect of its content or reliability of a character which it would be necessary for the jury to consider when deciding whether or not information of that kind would be likely to influence persons when deciding whether or not to buy or sell securities. 
     
      
    296    The next submission made with respect to this aspect of the directions was that at the various times that her Honour addressed the question of materiality she did not reiterate that the “information” which had to be assessed on this point was the “Information” as particularised. Her Honour had identified, and precisely quoted, those particulars at the very commencement of the passage of her summing-up in which she identified for the jury the various elements of the offence. Her Honour did not, however, reiterate the particulars on the subsequent occasions when she made reference to “information”. It would have been preferable for the jury to be reminded of this, by reason of the length of the summing-up. I would not, however, have been prepared to hold that in all the circumstances, this constituted an error of law or miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    297    The next challenge to this aspect of the directions concerns the references that her Honour made in the context of materiality to the events which actually transpired upon the announcement of the actual take-over. The Appellant submitted to this Court that the information which was available to the public at the time of the actual take-over was of a qualitatively different nature from the information that was particularised which referred to a mere “prospect of a takeover”. 
     
      
    298    The submission made by counsel for the Appellant was that the events that actually transpired when the take-over was announced were irrelevant as it was not based on “the information” as particularised by the Crown (AB2071). Plainly this submission must be right in the sense that an actual announced take-over must have an effect on the price of securities of a different quantum from that of the “prospect” of a take-over. That does not however mean that what actually happened was irrelevant to a consideration of materiality with respect to the information as particularised.  
     
      
    299    No doubt the effect on the price of securities of a mere “prospect” was less than the actuality, but that does not mean that what actually happened was irrelevant to an assessment of the materiality of the prospect. 
     
      
       
      Rejection of Draft Report 
       
      
    300    Her Honour rejected the tender of MFI 21 which was a draft research report prepared by Mr Myles, a research analyst with Macquarie Equities Limited. The final version of the document was tendered. It appears that, following a discussion between Mr Myles and Mr Poole, the head of the internal MFC team on the Tennis project, certain changes were made to the draft. Specifically, the take-over value was amended from $2.05 to $2.25, the words “TNT is vulnerable to a take-over” and “Companies who may be interested include - United Parcel Service, Federal Express, Dutch Post Office” - the Dutch Post Office being the ultimate successful bidder - were removed and a detailed section on “Looking at the Candidates”, referring to the Dutch Post Office, was removed. 
     
      
    301    Her Honour rejected the tender. There were no reasons published for this decision but it appears from the submissions that the rejection was based on the ground of relevance. 
     
      
    302    In this Court, the Appellant asserted that the draft was relevant to whether the “information” was generally available and also to whether it was material to the price or value of the securities. It was also said that, as it appeared that Mr Myles had discussed the issue with Mr Poole, this was a contravention of the embargo system. Why this latter point is at all material to the admissibility of the document does not appear clearly from the submissions. Mr Poole gave evidence. He was not cross-examined with any suggestion as to the contents of the conversation he may have had with Mr Myles. In any event if, which does not appear on the evidence, there was some form of contravention of the “embargo system”, that is not of any material relevance for this case. It is irrelevant to the issue of ‘general availability’. 
     
      
    303    The primary submission put in this regard was that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The fact that an analyst such as Mr Myles had deduced or concluded that TNT was a takeover target was a fact upon which the defence placed considerable reliance. It was immaterial that the document was only a draft and it was never disseminated. The point was that Mr Myles had been able to deduce this from information which was generally available. At the very least it raised doubts about whether the Information was not generally available and material to the price or value of the securities.” 
        
       
      
    304    In my opinion in circumstances where the final draft report was tendered, with a take-over value of $2.21 (AB2689), such advantage as the defence could claim to receive from Mr Myles’ analysis was available to them from the final report. In any event, for reasons I have identified above, I do not believe that analyses concerning the vulnerability to a take-over or brokers’ valuations of a share, are of significance, if relevant at all, to the issue of general availability of the information particularised, or the issue of the materiality of the information particularised to the price of the securities. There was no error of law or miscarriage of justice in this respect. 
     
      
       
       
      Objection to Other Evidence 
       
      
    305    The Appellant appealed against the admission, over objection, of evidence of conversations between MCF employees and officers who worked on the Tennis project. This ground particularly referred, as a separate category, to such evidence with respect to the period after 17 September 1996, being the date upon which instructions to acquire the options were given to Ord Minnett. The Appellant submitted that this evidence should have been rejected because it was either entirely irrelevant or its probative value was outweighed by potential prejudice to the Appellant including an alleged tendency of such evidence to be misused or to confuse. The submissions do not indicate why it was of any particular prejudice or why there was any tendency to mislead or confuse, save with respect to the evidence in the period after 17 September. In that respect the Appellant submitted that there was a real risk that an uninstructed jury would erroneously regard this evidence as evidence that the Appellant possessed the information at the relevant time, namely when the options were ordered. 
     
      
    306    The passages to which particular objection was taken included the following evidence: 
     
      
    · Mark Johnson, a Director of Macquarie Bank, gave evidence over objection at AB326 concerning the structure of Macquarie Corporate Finance. 
     
      
    · At AB329, Johnson gave evidence concerning what he learnt from Mr Poole in May 1996 about the retention of Macquarie Bank by TNT. 
     
      
    · At AB329, Johnson gave evidence that he was told by either Mr Poole or Mr Mortimer that there had been a serious approach made to TNT by KPM who were interested in making an offer to acquire TNT subject to a number of matters. 
     
      
    · David Poole, Executive Director of Macquarie Bank, at AB389 gave evidence concerning what he knew of project Tennis. 
     
      
    · At AB451, Poole gave evidence that he knew from approximately 18 September that the price had been settled at $2.45. 
     
      
    · Geoffrey Joyce, a Manager in Corporate Advisory, gave evidence at AB623 that on around 29 May or 30 May he learnt from TNT that KPM had indicated that they may be prepared to make a take-over bid for TNT. He gave further evidence that at that point the range mentioned was between $2.20 to $2.40. His evidence was that he gained this understanding from Con Green who was the Chief Financial Officer of TNT at that time. He gave further evidence concerning the formulation of the project Tennis team. 
     
      
    · Joyce gave evidence at AB638 concerning various meetings with Goldman Sachs in September 1996. He said that the purpose of the meetings was to discuss or negotiate the basis on which KPM would be prepared to proceed to make a take-over offer. He said that to his knowledge, the negotiations concluded on 18 September. That was the point, he said, at which TNT management proposed to take a take-over price of $2.45 to their board. 
     
      
    · Susan Rousselot, a manager in Corporate Advisory, gave evidence at AB659 about what she had been told concerning the take-over and the work she was asked to do. She gave further evidence that she understood from Mr Poole that the matter was to be treated very confidentially. 
     
      
    · Alistair Lucas, an Executive Director at Macquarie Bank and head of the Corporate Advisory Division based in Melbourne, gave evidence from AB1002 that after the Ansett sale was announced, his understanding of what occurred in relation to TNT and KPM was that “there was a prospect that Tennis could proceed and David Poole informed me that it was proceeding.” He said this would have been in late August or early September. 
     
      
    307    Some of the material, such as Mr Johnson’s evidence about the structure of MCF, was plainly directly relevant so the jury could have an appreciation of the background circumstances and the context in which access to information was allegedly obtained. Some of the conversations refer to the confidentiality of the information and that was directly relevant to the issue of “general availability”.  
     
      
    308    It may have also been the case that some of the conversations, or evidence as to the state of mind of the particular Macquarie officer, was relevant to an understanding of the context, and perhaps the contents, of documents held by, and material stored in the computers used by, these officers. However, the Crown made no attempt to justify each of the matters objected to in the Appellant’s written submissions in this manner. Nor was there any suggestion that the state of mind and knowledge of the officers, of the character contained in the evidence to which objection was taken, may at some stage have been contained in some documentary or electronic form - and therefore accessible by Mr Hannes - but was no longer in such a form. 
     
      
    309    The state of knowledge of officers of Macquarie Corporate Finance was relevant primarily, and to a substantial extent solely, to the issue of whether or not Mr Hannes possessed the information at the relevant time. In this respect there had to be some evidence concerning the actual or possible recording of the information in a form capable of access by Mr Hannes. With respect to many of the conversations objected to, there does not appear to be such evidence. 
     
      
    310    It may be that at least some of the material could be of significance to explain the context within which officers appreciated the significance of the confidentiality requirements and that would, as I have indicated above, be relevant to the issues of general availability and materiality. The Crown did not seek, in this Court, to address the particular matters about which complaint was made in this way.  
     
      
    311    With respect to those conversations which occurred in the absence of the Appellant, her Honour gave the jury clear directions as to the limited use to which they could be put. With respect to the evidence of Mr Johnson about his conversation with Mr Poole, the subject of the second bullet point above, her Honour indicated to the jury that that evidence could not be used to show that Mr Hannes had that knowledge at that time (AB329 line 15). Her Honour returned to this matter in the summing-up when she told the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I did give you a direction along those lines, but I repeat it because it is of importance that you understand that any of that material, you cannot use that as evidence against Mr Hannes that he had knowledge of those matters at that time.” (AB2060) 
        
       
       
        
        “You will remember this morning, members of the jury, that I did give you a direction about conversations, or discussions that Mr Poole and Mr Johnson had had with other people at which they learnt certain things about the possibility of this take-over, but I want to extent that to not only conversations that occurred between Mr Johnson and Mr Poole, and between Mr Poole and people that he spoke to at Hong Kong at the meeting you have heard about, but there are discussions took place later, you may remember those from evidence that representatives of the KPN, or Dutch post office people came to Australia, they were here during the period, a few days before the week commencing 16 September 1996. What I direct you in relation to any discussions of conversations taking place at those meetings, that that is, the Crown does not rely on that evidence as evidence that Mr Hannes, the accused, knew what was said at those discussions or conversations, but the Crown does rely on the fact that the discussions in fact took place between the representatives of TNT and the representatives of KPN, that is the Dutch post office, who was, as you know, the entity that was interested in taking over the shares in TNT.” (AB2080-2081. See also AB2205.) 
        
       
      
    312    As noted above the Appellant objected to the evidence concerning events after 17 September, when the instructions to acquire the options were made by “Booth”. During the course of the trial, objection had been taken to certain documents and events that occurred after that date, including objection to the negotiations between representatives of TNT and KPN which concluded on 18 September at a price of $2.45. The Crown had also led the evidence of a subsequent late night meeting and visits to the premises by Mr Hannes, e.g. on 18 September.  
     
      
    313    Whilst any conversation which occurred outside the hearing of Mr Hannes would only be relevant if it explained either the contents of or the context of a document or electronic record to which Mr Hannes may have had access, the basic premise of the Appellant’s case in this respect - that events after the instructions were given to acquire the options are irrelevant - should be rejected. Subsequent conduct may throw light on the state of the Appellant’s information as at the date of giving such instructions. It may, for example, explain the failure by “Booth” to trade in the options in the period up to the announcement of the takeover. There were also further communications with Mr Staehli of Ord Minnett as to how to deal with the options. In these ways, conduct which suggests access to insider information at a later time than 17 September, may be relevant and, accordingly, weighed in the balance of the circumstantial case as to possession of information at the time of the acquisition. 
     
      
    314    The clear directions that her Honour gave as to the restriction on the use of the conversations were, in my opinion, such as to prevent a miscarriage of justice occurring in that respect. It is, nevertheless, difficult to see that the evidence of the conversations was admissible or that the state of mind of particular individuals at particular points of time was admissible, unless it can be justified in one of the ways referred to above, which was not done in the course of this appeal. In the absence of any attempt to establish that the information conveyed in the conversations, or existing in the mind of particular officers, was in any way accessible by Mr Hannes, or otherwise relevant, this ground of appeal is, in my opinion, in part made out.  
     
      
    315    As I have concluded that there should be a new trial, it is not necessary to analyse the evidence in detail. Counsel did not address the Court in the manner to which I have referred above. I should note that I was not intending to be exhaustive as to the way in which evidence of this character may be made relevant to issues in the trial. The matter will no doubt receive further consideration in any new trial. 
     
      
       
      Expert Evidence 
       
      
    316    The Appellant submitted that her Honour’s summing-up was defective in that she did not refer, or sufficiently refer, to the evidence including the brokers’ reports, newspaper articles and the expert evidence of Mr Rhead called on behalf of the accused which, it was contended, was evidence that the jury should have taken into account on the issue of whether or not the information as particularised was “generally available”. It was submitted that her Honour did not specify that this body of evidence raised a relevant factual issue, or even that it was an argument put forward by the defence, save in what was described as an “oblique reference”. It was also submitted that her Honour’s reference to Mr Rhead’s evidence was negative and disparaging to the extent that her Honour, in effect, dismissed the evidence in a manner that was unfair. This being an issue for the jury to decide. It was submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        “Clearly, the publication of newspaper articles and brokers’ report could amount to information being made known in the manner referred to in s1002B(2)(b)(i). Such information would also be regarded as being readily observable.” 
        
       
      
    317    The Appellant further submitted that when her Honour did purport to summarise the evidence relevant to the issue of “generally available”, she only summarised the evidence of Mr Smith being the evidence called by the Crown. It was submitted that in the summary her Honour made no reference to the fact that Mr Smith’s qualifications, expertise and experience had been challenged on key",2000-11-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal

     R v Leanne Marie SAINSBURY 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1    DUNFORD J. This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to section 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the alleged inadequacy of sentences imposed by his Honour Acting Judge Ford QC in the District Court at Campbelltown on 9 June 2000 following the respondent's conviction after a jury trial on one count of larceny of a motor vehicle contrary to section 154A of the Crimes Act 1900, one count of stealing a motor vehicle contrary to section 154AA, two counts of break enter and steal and one count of using an offensive instrument with intent to prevent apprehension 9 June 2000. The respondent was ordered to perform 100 hours community service in respect of the offence of using an instrument with intent to prevent apprehension. The respondent was ordered to perform 100 hours community service in respect of each of the other 4 counts in the indictment, each of the sentences to be cumulative, making a total effective sentence of 200 hours community service. 
    2    I interpose here to say that the Department of Corrective Services appears to have taken the view that the total number of hours service to be performed was 100 hours, but this is clearly an error which the respondent has at all times acknowledged. His Honour's Remarks on Sentence are quite clear that the sentences were to be cumulative making a total of 200 hours. 
    3    The offence of larceny (s 154A) is punishable by a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment, that of stealing a motor vehicle contrary to s 154AA is punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, break enter and steal (s 112) is punishable by a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and the offence of using an offensive instrument with intent to avoid apprehension (s 33B) is punishable by a maximum penalty of 12 years imprisonment. 
    4    At about midday on 29 June 1998, the respondent, along with her then partner, Margaret Sanders, and two unidentified males, drove to the Woolworths carpark at Camden. The young child of Margaret Sanders accompanied them. They drove there in a Ford Falcon station-wagon which had been stolen the previous day by one of the males (count 1). At the carpark, one of the males stole a Ford Falcon station-wagon in the presence of the respondent (count 2). 
    5    The respondent then drove that vehicle to two homes in the suburb of Orangeville, near Camden, which were broken into by the group and from which a quantity of goods were stolen (counts 3 and 4). Both premises sustained damage due to the break-ins and the stolen goods were loaded by the group into the stolen Ford Falcon station-wagon. 
    6    The house alarm at the second premises broken into alerted police and a patrol car noticed the Ford Falcon station-wagon which, in the meantime, had been reported stolen by the owner. The respondent was driving. The police gave chase, but as they were in a caged vehicle, they were unable to keep up. 
    7    Other police vehicles joined the pursuit which continued for some 12 kilometres at speeds sometimes exceeding 130 km an hour. During the pursuit, the male passengers threw many of the large stolen items from the vehicle in an attempt to obstruct their pursuers. 
    8    At one stage the respondent lost control of the vehicle at a round-about, mounted the kerb and knocked over a fence before continuing on. This erratic and dangerous driving continued through traffic and numerous sets of traffic lights with up to 6 police vehicles following with their sirens and flashing lights activated. 
    9    Near an intersection in Claymore, the vehicle collided with another fence and came to a stop. At this point, Highway Patrol officers parked their vehicles around the Ford Falcon station-wagon so as to prevent it being driven further. The two males and Sanders quickly alighted from the vehicle and ran into a nearby reserve, one of the males taking the young child, leaving only the respondent behind. 
    10    At this stage, she reversed the station-wagon into a police vehicle and then she accelerated, veered to the left and drove straight at another police vehicle where a constable had one arm and one foot out of the car with the door three-quarters of the way open.  
    11    He was able to jump back into the vehicle, but his arm was still on the door, which was still open at the time and the Ford Falcon hit the police car. The acceleration of the stolen vehicle was such that its rear wheels were spinning. The force of the impact pushed the police vehicle a couple of feet sideways, caused the door to close and pushed the constable over to the passenger side, with the result he suffered soft tissue injury to his wrist and elbow and put his right arm out of use for two weeks. It also occasioned considerable damage to both vehicles.  
    12    At this stage, the respondent alighted and ran off before being arrested in a nearby reserve. Ms Sanders was also arrested, but the two males managed to escape. Ms Sanders was not subsequently charged owing to a lack of admissible evidence against her. 
    13    In an electronically recorded interview the respondent admitted to driving the Ford Station-wagon, but she claimed that the dishonesty offences were committed by her as a result of the duress directed at her by one of the males who she identified as Andrew Ingram. She said that the 2 males came to her home and forced her and Ms Sanders to accompany them and that, during the police pursuit, Ingram was threatening her with a knife and punching and hitting her as she drove the vehicle. 
    14    She alleged, in relation to hitting the police vehicle, that she missed the brake and put her foot on the accelerator instead. 
    15    The respondent did not give evidence at her trial, but relied on the account given in her record of interview. Ms Sanders gave evidence in the respondent's case along the lines of what the respondent had said in the record and Andrew Ingram gave evidence in the Crown case denying that he was present at all during the incident. 
    16    By convicting the appellant, the jury rejected her defences of duress to the dishonesty offences, and accident to the count of using an offensive instrument with intent to avoid apprehension. 
    17    The respondent was aged 27 years at the time of sentencing and had one previous conviction for larceny in October 1997, for which she had been fined $500. She was arrested on 29 June and spent one month in custody before being released on bail on 29 July 1998. 
    18    In R -v- Hamilton (1993) 66 A Crim R 575, in dealing with the seriousness of offences under s 33B, particularly where they involve the driving of vehicles in the direction of police officers, Gleeson CJ said, at p 581: 
     
      
       
       ""I should make it clear that offences against s 33B which make it unlawful to use an offensive weapon or instrument with intent to prevent lawful apprehension are regarded by the Court extremely seriously. It is incumbent upon the Court in dealing with offences of this nature to show an appropriate measure of support for police officers who undertake difficult, dangerous and usually thankless tasks."" 
       
      
      
    19    In that case, where the appellant had been found guilty by a jury of the offence under s 33B and pleaded guilty to 2 other property offences and asked that 5 associated summary offences be taken into account, an effective total sentence of 4 years 1 month was imposed, including a minimum term of 2½ years, cumulative upon a 9 month fixed term. 
    20    The judgment provides no details of the subjective features apart from a reference to the Sentencing Judge having said that he regarded the appellants as warranting a degree of leniency and noting prospects of rehabilitation; see also R -v-Hutchinson [2000] NSWCCA 113, where a sentence of 4 ½ years, including 2 ½ years minimum term, following a plea of guilty at the commencement of the trial to an offence under section 33B, was undisturbed, but in that case the appellant had an extensive criminal and driving record and I refer also to the remarks of Smart AJ in R -v- Bazzi [1999] NSWCCA 346 at [11]: 
     
      
       
       ""One of the objects of section 33B when it was introduced into the  
       Crimes Act 1900 
        in 1989 was to provide protection to the police and others who lawfully detain those reasonably suspected of committing an offence."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    21    In his Remarks on Sentence, his Honour, referring to the offence under s 33B, said: 
     
      
       
       ""That of course is a serious offence, a very serious offence.  
        
       Ordinarily, these offences would be offences (which) would attract a custodial sentence"", 
       
      
     but although  
     R -v- Hamilton 
      had been brought to his Honour's attention, he did not refer to it in terms, nor to any of the other cases. 
      
    22    To say an offence is ""serious"", or ""very serious"", is one thing, but his Honour failed to make reference to why this offence under s 33B was so serious, namely, the need to support police in carrying out their duties for the protection of the whole community. 
    23    In addition, in his Remarks on Sentence, his Honour failed to make any specific reference to the need for general deterrence. Although one might assume, as an experienced Judge, his Honour had the need for general deterrence in mind, in this case, he clearly allowed this consideration to be overlooked on account of the subjective features. It is, therefore, appropriate, that I turn to those subjective features. 
    24    The respondent was the elder of her mother's 2 children and grew up in the Liverpool area. Her mother's de facto relationship with the respondent's father broke up about 2 years after the respondent's birth. 
    25    Her mother then married about 2 years later and the marriage lasted for 7 years, after which her mother had a number of same sex and heterosexual short-term relationships, until she was murdered by her latest partner with whom she had recently broken up in 1986 when the respondent was 14 years old, and when she had returned to their former premises to recover her furniture. 
    26    She claims that she was sexually abused by a number of family members and such abuse, and the traumatic effect of her mother's murder, was confirmed to the Probation and Parole Service by her grandmother, and is noted in the Pre-Sentence Report. 
    27    The respondent then went to live with her grandmother but, having attended 4 different high schools and having completed her School Certificate, she left school part-way through Year 11 and at the same time left her grandmother's house, and lived on the streets for about 2 years, engaging in prostitution during that time although, during that period, she also had employment at McDonalds, the Pack and Saddle, and as a process worker at Rainfords. 
    28    She married in 1989 and there are 2 children, one of whom suffers from ADHD. The marriage broke up in 1997 and the respondent claims, and this is not disputed, that during the latter part of that relationship her husband became emotionally and physically abusive towards her, and the family was apparently subject to a lot of professional intervention because of the level of dysfunction. 
    29    When they separated, her husband obtained custody of 1 child and the respondent of the other, but she lost custody of that child shortly before the events giving rise to the present charges. 
    30    She then had an 18 month same sex relationship with the alleged co-offender, Sanders, who was also violent and unpredictable. The respondent had been using cannabis from age 12, until she stopped earlier this year, and she was also using heroin during 1997 and 1998, up to the time of her arrest; but she apparently dried out during the month in goal and has not used it since. 
    31    Apart from the employment already mentioned, she has also had a number of other positions, in particular, during 1999, after her arrest but before her trial, she worked at El Prima Italian Restaurant and received excellent work and personal references from her employer, who, in particular, noted that he had seen a change in her during the previous couple of months due to a change in her lifestyle. 
    32    Then, in February 2000, she commenced a two-year full-time diploma of business studies course at the Liverpool College of TAFE and there was before the Sentencing Judge a reference describing her as a regular attender, a good and attentive student whose tests and assignments were on time, and the teacher expressed the view that she would have no trouble in finding full-time employment of her choice after completing the course. 
    33    As already noted, the offences, particularly the offence under s 33B, were serious and the objective gravity of that offence and, to a lesser degree, of the others, in my view called for a full-time custodial sentence, and his Honour was in error in failing to impose such a sentence. 
    34    This was a case of a young woman who had had an unsettled, troubled and traumatic childhood and youth including sexual abuse and the murder of her mother at the age of 14 years. She had become involved with criminal associates and the use of illegal drugs which culminated in the commission of these offences which, with one exception, were her first offences. 
    35    Apart from 1 month in custody before being admitted to bail, she had never been in custody. She was not the instigator or principal of the offences and none of the other offenders had been prosecuted. She had severed her association with her criminal associates including the partner, Sanders, and had given up the use of heroin and cannabis. She had engaged in employment and was in the course of undertaking, with persistence and success, a TAFE course which would better equip her for full-time lawful employment. 
    36    This was not a case where the respondent or her psychologist were merely suggesting a desire for, or prospect of, rehabilitation. Rehabilitation was already under way and there was considerable force in the Sentencing Judge's Remarks that it would be extraordinarily unfortunate if she were to be put in goal where she could not complete that course which would lead to employment and open up a new and lawful chapter in her life. 
    37    These were, in the circumstances, proper considerations to be taken into account, but I nevertheless consider that the objective gravity of the offences, particularly the s 33B offence, called for a full-time custodial sentence, and this Court should intervene. 
    38    However, when this Court does intervene in Crown appeals, it has a wide discretion and it is necessary and appropriate to take into account the principle of double jeopardy, the delay that has necessarily occurred since she was first sentenced, and events which have happened in the meantime. 
    39    In the present case, the applicant has completed 100 hours of community service which the Department considers is all that is required. It was not, but she has already done an extra 16 hours and acknowledges that the order should have been for 200 hours. 
    40    An affidavit has been filed setting out her progress since then. The person in charge of the place where she has done the community service speaks highly of her performance, and this is of significance because he is a former police inspector and is aware of the offences she committed and therefore realises the importance of protecting police against such offences. 
    41    She has, in addition, given evidence for the Crown in a prosecution against one of the alleged co-offenders, Andrew Ingram, in proceedings in which he was convicted of 1 count of stealing a motor vehicle. This was not related to the offence in which she was involved, but in relation to another offence. It is still significant in that it indicates, or further demonstrates, a break with her former criminal associates. 
    42    She has served the month in goal before being admitted to bail to which I have already referred, and although she has discontinued the full-time course at TAFE, this is because she has been engaged in paid employment to pay off her debts. 
    43    Therefore, although, as I have already indicated, I consider the learned Sentencing Judge fell into error in not imposing a full-time custodial sentence of some severity for the offence under s 33B, I consider that the circumstances of this case are wholly exceptional and, having taken into account the principles of double jeopardy, the fact that she has completed 100 hours community service and done extra hours as well, that she has assisted police and the Crown in giving evidence against a former associate, the time served in custody before being admitted to bail, and the evidence of her continued rehabilitation, I consider that this is a case where it is not necessary or appropriate to impose a full-time custodial sentence at this time, and that a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention would be sufficient. 
    44    In relation to the 4 other offences, that is, the 2 offences involving the theft of motor vehicles and the 2 break enter and steals, I would propose that the Crown Appeal be dismissed and the 100 hours community service that she has already served be attributed to those offences. 
    45    In relation to the sentence of 100 hours community service for the offence under s 33B, I propose that the Crown appeal be allowed, the sentence quashed and in lieu thereof that the respondent be imprisoned for 18 months with a non-parole period of 12 months and that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention. Arrangements will have to be made to determine when and where she is to report. 
    46    WOOD CJ AT CL. I announce my agreement with the proposed orders and the reason for them announced by Dunford J. 
    47    CARRUTHERS. I also agree. 
    48    WOOD CJ AT CL. The sentence imposed below for the s 33B offence is quashed and in lieu thereof the respondent is sentenced to 18 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months, that sentence to be served by periodic detention and the respondent is directed to report to the Norma Parker Centre at Parramatta, to commence that sentence on 6 December next. 
    49    DUNFORD J. Otherwise, the appeal is dismissed in respect of the other sentences.

       REGINA v Clifford Ronald CONNORS 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
    1   GILES JA: I agree with James J 
     
      
    2   WOOD CJ at CL: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of James J. I agree with his reasons and the orders he proposes. 
     
      
    3   JAMES J: This is an appeal by Clifford Ronald Connors against his conviction, after a trial in the District Court before his Honour Judge Nield and a jury, on one charge of aggravated indecent assault (an offence under s61M of the Crimes Act) and four charges of homosexual intercourse with a male person aged between ten and eighteen years (offences under s78K of the Crimes Act). At the trial the jury found the appellant not guilty of another charge of aggravated indecent assault. 
     
      
    4   The complainant in the case of all the alleged offences was a boy born in November 1984, who was thirteen or fourteen years old at the time the offences were allegedly committed. The complainant’s age was the circumstance of aggravation in the alleged offences of aggravated indecent assault. 
     
      
    5   The appellant was the minister of a church in a suburb of Sydney, which the complainant’s mother, the complainant and the complainant’s younger brother (“B”), who was born in August 1987, attended. It was alleged by the Crown that all of the offences were committed in a house in which the appellant and his male partner, a man named Stuart Simons, lived, during periods while the complainant and his brother were staying at the house. 
     
      
    6   The Crown had initially wished to present a single indictment against the appellant, charging him, not merely with the six offences allegedly committed against the complainant, but also with three offences allegedly committed against B. However, before the trial commenced, Judge Nield ruled that there should be separate trials of the charges involving the complainant and the charges involving B. Accordingly, the indictment presented by the Crown at the trial was limited to the charges involving the complainant. Judge Nield also ruled that at the trial of the charges involving the complainant evidence that the appellant had committed offences against B would not be admissible and, in accordance with his Honour’s ruling, no such evidence was adduced at the trial.  
     
      
    7   The charges in the indictment which was presented at the trial can be summarised as follows:- 
     
      
       
      1. Aggravated indecent assault committed between 11 January 1998 and 16 January 1998. 
       
       
      2. Aggravated indecent assault committed between 1 February 1998 and 30 April 1998. 
       
       
      3. Homosexual intercourse committed between 1 February 1998 and 30 April 1998. 
       
       
      4. Homosexual intercourse committed between 1 February 1998 and 30 April 1998. 
       
       
      5. Homosexual intercourse committed between 1 September 1998 and 31 December 1998. 
       
       
      6. Homosexual intercourse committed between 5 January 1999 and 16 January 1999. 
       
      
    8   The charge on which the appellant was found not guilty was the charge in the first count in the indictment of aggravated indecent assault between 11 January 1998 and 16 January 1998. 
     
      
    9   During the trial the fifth count in the indictment was amended, so as to extend the period within which the offence was allegedly committed to 1 July 1998 to 31 December 1998. The fifth ground of appeal in the grounds of appeal filed was that the trial judge had erred in permitting this amendment. However, this ground of appeal was subsequently abandoned and no submission was made in support of it. 
     
      
    10   After the jury returned their verdicts of guilty, Judge Nield sentenced the appellant for the offence of aggravated indecent assault charged in the second count in the indictment to imprisonment for a fixed term of six months to commence on 12 November 1999, for the offence of homosexual intercourse charged in the third count in the indictment to penal servitude for a fixed term of one year to commence on 12 November 1999, for the offence of homosexual intercourse charged in the fourth count in the indictment to penal servitude for a fixed term of one year six months to commence on 12 November 1999, for the offence of homosexual intercourse charged in the sixth count in the indictment to penal servitude for a fixed term of one year to commence on 12 May 2001 and for the offence of homosexual intercourse charged in the fifth count in the indictment to penal servitude for a term of three years six months, with a minimum term of six months to commence on 12 May 2002 and an additional term of three years. 12 November 1999 was the date on which, the jury having returned their verdicts of guilty, Judge Nield declined to continue the bail which had previously been granted to the appellant. The total effective sentence imposed on the appellant consisted of fixed terms or a minimum term of penal servitude or imprisonment totalling three years and an additional term of three years. In the event of his appeal against conviction being dismissed, the appellant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by Judge Nield. 
     
      
       
      The Crown Case 
       
      
    11   The witnesses who gave evidence for the Crown at the trial were the complainant, the complainant’s brother B, Mr Raymond Menzies and a police officer Senior Constable Harding. The evidence in chief of these witnesses and the cross-examination of some of them can be briefly summarised as follows. I will defer dealing with the cross-examination of the complainant, until after I have summarised the evidence of the defence witnesses.  
     
      
       
      The Complainant’s Evidence in Chief 
       
      
    12   The complainant was born in November 1984. In 1997 he met the appellant as the minister of a church in a suburb of Sydney, which his mother began attending with her two children. 
     
      
    13   In early 1998 the complainant’s mother and her current partner, a female, wanted a break from looking after the two boys and the appellant said that he would mind the boys while the complainant’s mother and her partner went out together.  
     
      
    14   The complainant made an entry for 12 January 1998 in a diary for 1998 which he had been given as a Christmas present. This entry read “go Cliff and Stuart house (Addams family house)”. The reference to the Addams’ family house was a reference to a house in a popular television show.  
     
      
    15   The complainant and his brother went to the appellant’s house on Monday 12 January 1998 and stayed for three nights. On this visit, as on other visits, they shared a large bed in a guest room in the house.  
     
      
    16   At about 5 o’clock on the first morning of this stay, that is the morning of 13 January, the appellant came into the spare bedroom, got into the bed and lay against the complainant in what the complainant described as “the spoon position”. In this position the appellant lay with his back against the front of the complainant’s body and “he would push his bum against my genitals in a rhythm”. The appellant himself used the expression “the spoon position”. The appellant said “Let’s try this. It’s called the spoon position”.  
     
      
    17   This conduct by the appellant on the first morning of this visit was the subject of the charge of aggravated indecent assault in the first count in the indictment.  
     
      
    18   The next occasion on which the complainant and B went to stay at the appellant’s home was at the end of February 1998, “because my Mum and Kim went to Mardi Gras and so Cliff offered to mind my brother and I”. 
     
      
    19   Early on the first morning of this stay the appellant entered the bedroom, got into the bed and adopted the “spoon position”. 
     
      
    20   On the morning of the second day of this visit the appellant repeated this conduct, “then after that he put his head under the blankets and started to suck my penis”. The appellant asked the complainant “if I … wanted to do it properly… and I just said yes, and so he took me out into the lounge room and …. He laid me on the lounge”. The appellant continued to suck the complainant’s penis and then “he laid on the lounge and got me to put my penis up his anus”. The appellant then got the complainant to masturbate the appellant.  
     
      
    21   The adoption by the appellant of the spoon position was the subject of the second count in the indictment, the sucking of the complainant’s penis by the appellant was the subject of the third count in the indictment and the penetration of the appellant’s anus by the complainant’s penis was the subject of the fourth count in the indictment. 
     
      
    22   As his Honour instructed the jury at the trial, an act of homosexual intercourse falls within s78K of the Crimes Act, even though the sexual connection takes the form of penetration of the offender’s anus by the complainant’s penis (see the definition of “homosexual intercourse” in s78G of the Crimes Act). No other charges were brought against the appellant on the basis of his conduct on this occasion. 
     
      
    23   In the 1998 Christmas holidays the complainant had a conversation with Mr Raymond Menzies at the latter’s home. Mr Menzies was eighty-three years old. The complainant told Mr Menzies:- 
     
      
       
        
        “That Cliff had sucked my penis and had got me to put my penis up his bum and about the spoon position, how he would rub his bum against my genitals and how he had masturbated me and got me to masturbate him”. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    24   The complainant had not told anybody else about the appellant’s conduct, because he did not feel comfortable about telling anybody else. 
     
      
    25   After the conversation with Mr Menzies the complainant stayed at the appellant’s house with his brother between 5 January and 10 January 1999 and again from 14 January to 16 January 1999. 
     
      
    26   On the first morning of this visit (that is the morning of 6 January) the appellant entered the bedroom, got into the bed and adopted the spoon position. He then put his head under the blankets and sucked the complainant’s penis. The appellant got the complainant to penetrate the appellant’s anus, while the appellant was in the spoon position. This was followed by mutual masturbation.  
     
      
    27   The sucking of the complainant’s penis by the appellant was the subject of the sixth count in the indictment. No other charge was laid against the appellant on the basis of any of his other conduct on this occasion. 
     
      
    28   During the time he was staying at the appellant’s house in January 1999 the complainant said to the appellant that he did not want to do any more the things he and the appellant had been doing in the mornings. The appellant said that was “O.K, so long as I didn’t tell anybody”. There was no further sexual contact between the appellant and the complainant and the complainant never subsequently stayed at the appellant’s home.  
     
      
    29   Late in his evidence in chief the complainant gave evidence that, less than six months before his conversation with Mr Menzies, anal intercourse had occurred between the complainant and the appellant. This conduct was the subject of the fifth count in the indictment. As I have already indicated, after the complainant had given this evidence, the fifth count in the indictment was amended, so as to extend the period within which this offence had allegedly occurred. 
     
      
       
      The Complainant’s brother B. 
       
       
       
      Evidence in Chief 
       
      
    30   B was born in August 1987. He confirmed that he and the complainant had stayed a number of times at the appellant’s house, sleeping together in a large bed in the guest room. Their last stay had been in January 1999. 
     
      
    31   The first night B and the complainant stayed at the appellant’s home, the appellant got into the bed, between the two boys. The appellant got up close to the boys and cuddled them. While the appellant was in the bed, B noticed that the bed was rocking.  
     
      
    32   On other occasions, in the late night or early morning, the appellant had come into the boys’ bedroom and got into their bed. The appellant had sometimes lain with his penis against the complainant’s “behind”. 
     
      
    33   On one occasion in the bedroom, while the complainant was on the bed and B was using a computer close to the bed, B saw “Cliff put his hand down my brother’s pants” and B saw the appellant’s hand moving in a “squeezing motion” for about two minutes. 
     
      
       
      Cross-examination 
       
      
    34   B had not noticed the appellant getting into the bed but had sometimes woken up, when the appellant was already in the bed. B had pretended to be asleep, while the appellant was in the bed. 
     
      
    35   The incident when B saw the appellant put his hand down the complainant’s pants had occurred in the daytime, on the first day of the boys’ visit in January 1999. On this occasion the appellant had been in the bedroom “half a day”. Both the appellant and the complainant had had all their clothes on. When the appellant had put his hand down the complainant’s pants, the complainant had looked “really uncomfortable”. 
     
      
    36   B denied that during the last stay in January 1999 the appellant had become upset with the boys. 
     
      
       
      Other Crown witnesses 
        
       
      
    37   Mr Raymond Menzies gave evidence that from April 1998 he had attended services at the appellant’s church. He had become friendly with the complainant, B and their mother. He had played a number of games of golf with the complainant, who showed promise as a golfer.  
     
      
    38   Mr Menzies gave evidence about a conversation he had had with the complainant at Mr Menzies’ home. Mr Menzies was unsure of the actual date of the conversation. The conversation had been around December 1998; Mr Menzies thought that it had been after Christmas.  
     
      
    39   Mr Menzies gave the following evidence about the conversation:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I was making a cup of tea and he said to me, ‘look, can I tell you something, if you promise not to tell anybody else”? and I said, ‘yes, I’ll make that promise’, and he said, ‘it’s at Cliff’s place.. I go there and he plays with my knob or sucks my knob and then he puts my knob up his bum’, and I said, ‘did you - would you have had an erection there?’ he said, ‘yes, Cliff would play with it’ and I think that was the conversation at that moment and I said, ‘I’ll promise not to tell anybody but I’m not sure what to do… he said, ‘Oh, this would happen in the bed’, but he said, ‘on occasions he took me out to a lounge in another room and there those things would take place”. 
        
       
      
    40   Mr Menzies thought that the complainant’s tone of voice during this conversation with him was one of embarrassment. 
     
      
    41   In cross-examination Mr Menzies accepted that the conversation with the complainant of which he had given evidence could have occurred as late as about 20 January 1999. 
     
      
    42   Mr Menzies said that, as well as playing golf with the complainant, the complainant had helped him by painting two ceilings in Mr Menzies’ house, Mr Menzies being too old to use a ladder. 
     
      
    43   Senior Constable Harding gave evidence that he had obtained statements from the complainant and B in early February 1999. On 12 February 1999 he had spoken to the appellant about the allegations made by the complainant but the appellant had exercised his right to silence.  
     
      
    44   Senior Constable Harding said that in 1998 the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras had been on 28 February.  
     
      
       
      The Defence Case  
       
      
    45   A number of witnesses, including the appellant, gave evidence in the defence case. 
     
      
       
      The Appellant’s Evidence in Chief 
       
      
    46   The appellant had been living with his partner Stuart Simons in the house in which the offences had allegedly been committed since July 1980. He had met the complainant, B and their mother at a church service in 1997. 
     
      
    47   The appellant described the house in which he lived as “a Georgian Colonial home with thirteen rooms overloaded with antiques”. One item in the house was a set of girandoles, that is brass candle sticks with hanging crystal pendants, which was on a sideboard in a hallway adjacent to the master bedroom which the appellant shared with his partner. The appellant said that the pendants made a loud noise, if anyone walked past the girandoles. 
     
      
    48   The appellant denied ever having had any sexual contact with the complainant. On one occasion he had been on top of the bed in the guest room between the two boys but on that occasion he was watching a video. On a couple of occasions he had been on the bed in the guest room, scratching the complainant’s back or having his back scratched by the complainant. 
     
      
    49   The appellant gave detailed evidence of what he said had happened on 12 January 1998. It had been pre-arranged with the complainant’s mother that she would bring the two boys to the appellant’s home on the morning of 12 January and that the two boys would be returned to their mother at the home of another clergyman named Clark at Bondi Junction that evening. 
     
      
    50   On 12 January 1998 the two boys arrived at the appellant’s house, with their mother and her partner, in the morning. They were given a tour of the house. After the tour the complainant’s mother and her partner left. In the afternoon the appellant and his partner took the two boys on excursions to a number of places.  
     
      
    51   In the evening of 12 January the appellant and his partner took the two boys to Mr Clark’s house at Bondi Junction. The boys’ mother and her partner were already at the house. All of those present had dinner at the house at Bondi Junction. After dinner the two boys, their mother and her partner left. After they had left there was meeting of the Board of Directors of the appellant’s church. The Board meeting started at 7.30 and “should have finished by 10 pm”. Minutes of the Board meeting were admitted into evidence. The appellant denied that the two boys had spent the night of 12 January 1998 at the appellant’s house. The appellant said that the first overnight stay by the two boys at the appellant’s house had been on 20 and 21 February 1998. 
     
      
    52   The complainant and B stayed at the appellant’s house on 28 February 1998 and 1 March 1998. The night of 28 February 1998 was the night of the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade. The boys’ mother had asked the appellant and his partner to have the two boys, because she and her partner wanted to attend the parade and a baby sitting arrangement the boys’ mother had made with someone else had fallen through. The boys had been returned to their mother, after a church service on the night of Sunday 1 March. 
     
      
    53   The appellant gave evidence about other occasions on which the complainant and B had stayed with the appellant and his partner at their house, including details of numerous excursions on which he said he and his partner had taken the boys. 
     
      
    54   The appellant gave evidence about what seemed to him to be misconduct by the complainant and his brother during their last stay in January 1999.  
     
      
    55   One night the appellant had suggested to the two boys that they should go to bed, because “a very demanding excursion had been planned for the next day” but the complainant had replied “I want to stay up to watch the sexy movies on T.V”. 
     
      
    56   The complainant was away from the appellant’s home between 10 January and 14 January. On 14 January the appellant went with B in the appellant’s car to pick up the complainant. On the return journey to the appellant’s home, both boys had been deliberately “flatulent” in the car and had not stopped their conduct, after the appellant had told them to stop. The appellant became angry with the boys because of their disobedience. 
     
      
    57   On Friday 15 January the two boys helped at a church stall at Bondi Junction. B made a nuisance of himself by repeatedly disappearing from the stall.  
     
      
    58   On the way home from the stall in the appellant’s car the appellant and the complainant talked. The appellant gave evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Amongst the things he said to me, he told me that at……school he and a group of friends of his had a suspicion about a science teacher being gay and they decided to set him up to see what his reaction would be when they asked him if he knew about a gay porn star called John Holmes. He then informed me that one of the group asked the teacher that question, the teacher went red in the face on hearing that question and (the complainant) laughed and said, ‘he obviously gave himself away and we knew he was gay’ and continued to laugh at the event… (the complainant) asked me if I’d seen any photographs of John Holmes in the nude. I responded that I had and (the complainant) asked me what he looked like. I said he was an ugly looking man, very tall, very thin, looked much like a stick insect and (the complainant) asked me if he had a big dick and I said he was renowned for his endowment”. 
        
       
      
    59   On the last day of the visit the two boys were to return to their home in a country town by train. The two boys spent too much time getting ready. “Finally I screamed at them to get everything together and we had to race in order to get the train”.  
     
      
    60   In the car on the way to the railway station the complainant said to B, “I don’t think we’ll be coming back here again”. 
     
      
    61   When they arrived at the vicinity of the railway station, the appellant, who had to find somewhere to park his car, instructed the complainant to keep an eye on his younger brother, go straight to the station, get their tickets and wait for the appellant near a ticket counter. 
     
      
    62   When the appellant arrived at the ticket counter B was missing. The complainant said “He’s over the road in a shop”. The appellant ran to the shop and got B. They ran to the station and up on to the platform, arriving “about thirty seconds before the train arrived”. The appellant said “While on the station I, very angrily, told the boys off. I told (the complainant) that I was bitterly disappointed in him for not doing what I told him to do in keeping B with him and looking after him and I particularly stripped B, verbally, for disobeying me and jeopardising the chance of catching that train”. 
     
      
    63   The appellant said that he had a medical condition affecting his hands, which caused his hands to be cold for most of the year.  
     
      
    64   The appellant said that no lights were left on in the house all the night. His partner turned off all the lights in the house, when his partner retired for the night. 
     
      
       
      Cross-examination 
        
       
      
    65   The appellant had consulted his partner’s diary in preparing a record of the events of which he had given evidence. The appellant had destroyed his own diary in early January 1999.  
     
      
    66   The appellant accepted that the Minutes of the Board meeting on 12 January 1998 showed that the meeting had concluded at 9.15, not at 10 o’clock as his evidence in chief would have tended to suggest.  
     
      
    67   The appellant agreed that the internal walls of the house were made of thick sandstone but denied that noises in one room could not be heard in another room. The appellant agreed that the complainant and B had stayed in the guest room, that the guest room was at the opposite end of the house from the master bedroom which the appellant and his partner occupied and that the master bedroom was separated from the lounge room by a thick wall. There was a sofa in the lounge room on which it would be possible to lie. The bed in the guest room was “a huge bed”, with plenty of room for the two boys and another person to be in it. 
     
      
    68   The amount of noise made by the girandoles, if someone walked past, would depend on “the size of the person and the heaviness of their tread”. It would be possible for someone to move through the house at night “without causing (as the appellant had suggested in chief) a mighty rattle on the girandoles”. 
     
      
    69   The appellant believed that his partner turned off all the lights in the house when his partner went to bed (which was some time after the appellant himself retired for the night). The appellant accepted that he knew the layout of the house and of the objects in the house “but in the dark I wouldn’t necessarily know where they are”. The door to the master bedroom was left open at night. The appellant frequently got up at night to go to the toilet.  
     
      
    70   On the occasions when the appellant had scratched the complainant’s back, he had scratched the complainant’s back through his clothes.  
     
      
    71   The appellant accepted that the complainant had never made an issue to the appellant of the appellant being in a relationship with a same sex partner. The appellant knew that the complainant’s mother was a lesbian and had been told that his father had been a homosexual man who had died. 
     
      
    72   During the last visit in January 1999 the appellant became annoyed because the complainant had wet the bed in the guest room and became angry with the complainant when the complainant said that he had wet the bed because he had seen a ghost which was supposed to frequent the house. The appellant said to the complainant “I’m not angry at you wetting the bed, you can’t help that accident but I’m angry at you for telling me a lie”. This alleged incident had not been put in cross-examination to either the complainant or B who had also been present. 
     
      
    73   The appellant said that during a visit in August 1998 the complainant had told the appellant that he had seen a film “Indecent Proposal” and had said “Cliff, you wouldn’t like it, because it has a lot of sex in it”. 
     
      
    74   The appellant denied using the expression “the spoon position”.  
     
      
    75   The appellant claimed that when the boys finally left in January 1999 “(the complainant) had a very sour expression on his face and looked angry to me”.  
     
      
      Mr Simons 
       
       
      Evidence in Chief 
       
      
    76   Mr Simons confirmed that he had lived together with the appellant since 1980. He was member of the appellant’s church.  
     
      
    77   On 12 January 1998 he and the appellant had brought the two boys to a house at Bondi Junction. The two boys had been at the dinner eaten at that house but left before the meeting of the Board of Directors of the church. 
     
      
    78   If there was motion in the vicinity of the girandoles, they would “tinkle”; considerably, if someone of the appellant’s weight walked past.  
     
      
    79   After the last visit by the boys in January 1999, the appellant “was very annoyed with the behaviour of the boys, as was I”.  
     
      
    80   Mr Simons had noticed that “particularly in winter” the appellant’s hands were cold. Even at the time of the trial in November 1999, the appellant’s hands were “cool at least, if not cold”.  
     
      
    81   Mr Simons gave evidence of the appellant’s good character. He said that in twenty years of living together he had never known the appellant to tell a lie. 
     
      
       
      Cross-examination 
       
      
    82   In cross examination Mr Simons said that he did not usually go to bed before midnight and might not go to bed before 1.30 or 2 o’clock. He would usually wake up between 4 and 5 o’clock in the morning. 
     
      
    83   Mr Simons gave evidence consistent with the appellant’s evidence about events on 12 January 1998. He initially said that during the tour of the house “I think Cliff showed them into the bedroom where they were going to stay” but later in his cross-examination he said that it was not true that the appellant had shown the boys the bedroom during this visit. 
     
      
    84   Mr Simons said that the appellant suffered from cold hands “more in winter time than in this time of the year”. Notwithstanding the condition of his hands, the appellant could drive a car, operate a computer and engage in sexual activity. However, that morning the appellant had put his hand on Mr Simons’ stomach and the appellant’s hand had felt cold. 
     
      
    85   Mr Simons asserted that, if the appellant got up and went to the toilet early in the morning, he, Mr Simons, would wake up. 
     
      
    86   Mr Simons accepted that, if he was in the main bedroom, he would not be able to hear anything happening in the spare bedroom. 
     
      
    87   Mr Simons recollected that in January 1999 the appellant had spent quite a bit of time in the spare bedroom, “working on his computer”.  
     
      
       
      Other Defence Witnesses 
       
      
    88   A number of other witnesses gave evidence in the defence case. 
     
      
    89   A doctor gave evidence that he had examined the appellant on 30 September 1999 and had found that the appellant’s hands were rather cold to the touch and had an unusual bluish discolouration. The doctor said that there is a medical condition known as “Raynaud’s phenomena”, which is a hypersensitivity to cold, mainly affecting the blood vessels in the hands and feet. The doctor did not expressly say in his evidence that he considered that the appellant was suffering from Raynaud’s phenomena but this would appear to be implicit in his evidence. The symptoms of Raynaud’s phenomena can be relieved by warming the relevant body parts.  
     
      
    90   A number of other witnesses gave evidence in the defence case. A number of these witnesses gave evidence to the effect that they had attended the Board meeting on the evening of 12 January 1998 and that the boys and their mother had not stayed for the Board meeting. These witnesses also gave evidence of the good character of the appellant. Some other witnesses also gave evidence of the good character of the appellant. 
     
      
       
      The Complainant’s Cross-examination 
       
      
    91   In cross-examination the complainant said that he had written the very first entry in the diary about going to the appellant’s house on 12 January 1998, before he went to stay at the appellant’s house. He thought that he had got to the appellant’s house on this occasion, by being taken by the appellant after a church service. 
     
      
    92   Later in the cross-examination the complainant accepted that on 12 January 1998 he had gone to a “meeting” at Bondi and had had dinner there and had been taken away by his mother. However, the complainant said he was sure that he had stayed at the appellant’s home for three days from 12 January 1998. In saying this “I’m just going off what my diary says”. 
     
      
    93   On the occasion on which the offence charged in the first count had been allegedly committed, the complainant had been woken up by the movement of the appellant getting into the bed. On the first occasion the appellant came into the bedroom at night, he had said that he and his partner used the spoon position when they were in bed and the appellant had demonstrated the spoon position to the complainant.  
     
      
    94   On the occasion on which the offences charged in the second, third and fourth counts had been committed, the appellant had touched the complainant’s penis with his hands. The complainant had noticed nothing unusual about the appellant’s hands. On other occasions also the appellant had touched the complainant with his hands. On these occasions the complainant had noticed nothing out of the ordinary about the appellant’s hands.  
     
      
    95   On each occasion on which the appellant had got into the bed B had been in the bed but he had appeared to the complainant to be asleep.  
     
      
    96   During their stays at the house the appellant’s partner was at the house but “he wasn’t usually with us, he was… doing his own thing”. 
     
      
    97   The complainant said that “some words” had been used during the last stay in January 1999 but he denied that there had been any argument or conflict. He denied that the last visit had ended badly with the appellant being upset by the behaviour of the complainant and B. He denied that B had run away when the two of them were helping at a stall. The complainant denied telling the appellant that it had been suggested to a teacher at his school that the teacher was homosexual. Some pupils in the complainant’s class at school had mentioned a film star John Holmes and the complainant had asked the appellant if he knew who John Holmes was, because his mother did not. The complainant denied that John Holmes’ name had been mentioned to a teacher at his school. 
     
      
    98   The complainant denied that he had teased anyone at his school for being homosexual. He retorted that he had a lesbian mother and a gay father “so I don’t think I’d be teasing someone about being gay”. The complainant denied having watched the film “Indecent Proposal”.  
     
      
    99   The complainant said that when he and B were staying at the house lights in the house were left on, specifically so that the complainant and B could find their way to the toilet at night.  
     
      
    100   The complainant denied that the girandoles would jingle if one walked past. He said they would make a noise, only if they were bumped. 
     
      
    101   The complainant volunteered that he had got pleasure from having his back scratched by the appellant. The complainant had given the appellant a present for the appellant’s birthday in December 1998.  
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    102   The grounds of appeal against conviction in the notice of grounds of appeal which was filed were as follows:- 
     
      
       
      “1. The Trial Judge erred in failing to warn the Jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence of the Complainant and the weight to be given to it as required by Section 165(2)(c) of the  
      Evidence Act 
       1995. 
       
       
      2. The Trial Judge erred in failing to warn the Jury that they should scrutinise the evidence of the Complainant with great care. 
       
       
      3. The Trial Judge failed to direct the Jury as to what evidence could constitute corroboration of the Complainant’s evidence. 
       
       
      4. The Trial Judge failed to adequately direct the Jury with respect to the issue of motive, in that the Trial Judge failed to direct the Jury that even if they reject the alleged motive for a Complainant to lie put forward by the Accused, that does not mean the Complainant is necessarily telling the truth. 
       
       
      5. The Trial Judge erred in allowing the Crown to amend Count 5 in the Indictment with respect to the dates between which that offence was alleged to have been committed. 
       
       
      6. The verdicts were unreasonable and/or incapable of being supported by the evidence”. 
       
      
    103   I will deal with these grounds of appeal in the order in which they appear in the notice. 
     
      
       
      1. The Trial Judge erred in failing to warn the Jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence of the Complainant and the weight to be given to it as required by Section 165(2)(c) of the  
      Evidence Act 
       1995. 
       
      
    104   At the trial, after counsel had made their final addresses, the trial judge asked counsel, in the absence of the jury, whether either of them wished to make any submission about s165 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    105   Counsel for the appellant at the trial said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The age of witnesses is commonly a reason for them being thought to be unreliable and it would be upon that that I would - that is the evidence of children”. 
        
       
      
    106   The Crown Prosecutor opposed the giving of a warning under s165 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    107   The trial judge observed that the age of the complainant and B was the only basis on which counsel for the appellant at the trial could request that a warning under s165 be given and his Honour queried whether a warning should be given on the ground of the age of a witness, when the witness (the complainant) was almost fifteen years old at the time of giving evidence. His Honour referred to the two witnesses, the complainant and B, and said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “If I give a direction concerning one, then it would seem odd not to give it concerning two, bearing in mind one is fourteen, almost a week away from being fifteen, and the other is (twelve)”. 
        
       
      
    108   His Honour concluded his discussion with counsel by saying:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Well I think I might mention something about it”. 
        
       
      
    109   In the summing-up his Honour, after referring to the assessment of witnesses generally, said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Members of the jury there are some things that I must say about some of the witnesses specifically. The first thing I want to say concerns the evidence of the complainant and his brother. I say these things to you, not because I have formed a view of the evidence of the complainant and his brother. 
         
        I give you this warning because the law requires that I give you this warning. 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence of a child may be unreliable because of the child’s age. I am not suggesting that the evidence of a child is necessarily unreliable because of the child’s age, I am saying that the evidence of a child may be unreliable because of the child’s age. Obviously the younger the child, the greater might be the unreliability of what the child says. Now you do not need a judge to tell you that, you know, using your own commonsense, that what a child says may be unreliable, and that, the younger the child, the greater the possibility of unreliability. What I say to you is that, because of the age of the complainant and his brother - I shall come to their ages in a moment - their evidence may be unreliable. I am not suggesting that their evidence is unreliable, I am not telling you what opinion I have formed about their reliability, I am commenting that, because the law requires that I comment, the evidence of a child may be unreliable because of the child’s age. 
        
       
       
        
        The complainant was born on 24 November 1984, he is two weeks away from his fifteenth birthday. The complainant’s brother …, was born on 6 August 1987 and he is three months past his twelfth birthday. You have seen both the complainant and his brother give evidence to you. You know their ages, not only because I have reminded you of what they are, but because each was asked his birth date. You are the judges of the facts and it is for you, as the judges of the facts, to assess the reliability of each of them. All I am saying to you is that when you assess their reliability you remember that their age may indicate unreliability, not that their age indicates unreliability, only that it may indicate unreliability, and I say that to you, not because of any opinion that I have formed concerning them, only because the law requires that I say that to you”. 
        
       
      
    110   Section 165 of the Evidence Act provides, so far as is immediately relevant:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence:  
        
       
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) Evidence the reliability of which may be affected by age... 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury”. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
    111   It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that defence counsel at the trial had requested that a direction be given under s165 because of the age of the complainant and B and that the trial judge had made a determination that a warning under s165 was required. It was accepted by counsel for the appellant that what the trial judge had said in the summing-up was a sufficient compliance with pars(a)and (b) of ss(2) of s165 but it was submitted that the trial judge had failed to comply with par(c). No application for any further direction had been made by trial counsel but it was submitted that leave should be granted under r4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely on this ground of appeal, because of the importance in the present case of a proper and full warning under s165. 
     
      
    112   I do not consider that leave should be given to rely on this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    113   The trial judge, after having seen and heard the complainant and B give their evidence and being cognisant of their ages, clearly doubted whether it was really necessary for him to give any warning under s165 and particularly in the case of the complainant, who at the time of giving evidence was within a few days of attaining his fifteenth birthday. It is, indeed, unclear whether the trial judge in concluding that “I might mention something about it” was making a determination that he should give a direction fully complying with s165 or deciding that he should exercise a power under the general law to give a more limited warning to the jury, a power which is preserved by ss(5) of s165. 
     
      
    114   In my opinion, his Honour was well warranted in doubting whether it was necessary for him to give a warning under s165 about the evidence of either the complainant or B and, in my opinion, he was not required to give such a warning. 
     
      
    115   In R v AGJ (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 30 October 1997) Hunt CJ at CL said at p2 that there was:- 
     
      
       
        
        “no warrant for interpreting the reference to ‘age’ in s165(1)(c) as requiring a warning to be given in every case in which the complainant is a child. The need will depend upon whether the circumstances in which the child gives evidence may rationally be considered as affecting the reliability of that evidence - for example, the fact the child is giving evidence of events which happened a significant time ago”. 
        
       
       
      
    116   In the present case the complainant and B were giving evidence in November 1999, not about events which had happened a significant time before, but about events which had occurred within the last two years or the last year before the trial.  
     
      
    117   If a warning under s165 is required, it is not necessary that any particular form of words be used (ss(4)). In the present case it was conceded that what his Honour said in the summing-up was sufficient to comply with pars(a) and (b) and, in my opinion, his Honour, by saying he had to give special directions about the evidence of the complainant and B and that the evidence of the complainant and B might be unreliable because of their ages, would have conveyed, in the context of the summing-up taken as a whole, that the jury should treat the evidence of the complainant and B with special care. Elsewhere in the summing-up the trial judge expressly told the jury:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The principal issue in this trial concerns the acceptability, the reliability of the complainant and his brother”. 
        
       
      
    118   It is significant that no application for any further direction was made by counsel for the appellant at the trial, who was clearly aware of s165 and who, it should be inferred, was content with the directions which had been given. 
     
      
    119   It is also noteworthy that during their retirement the jury sent a note to the trial judge asking to see or hear the complainant’s evidence again. The sending of this note would suggest the jury understood the need to closely scrutinise the complainant’s evidence. 
     
      
    120   Having regard particularly to the ages of the two witnesses; the fact that they were giving evidence of events occurring within a couple of years of the trial and not many years previously; the trial judge’s doubts about whether any warning was really necessary; the uncertainty about whether the trial judge actually made a finding that a warning under s165 was required, as distinct from some kind of warning under the general law; the likelihood that it was conveyed to the jury by what the trial judge said in the summing-up that the jury had to approach the evidence of the complainant and his brother with special care; the request by the jury to be supplied with a copy of the transcript of the complainant’s evidence; and the absence of any request for any further direction by counsel who was clearly aware of the possible applicability of s165 of the Evidence Act, I would refuse leave to rely on this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      2. The Trial Judge erred in failing to warn the Jury that they should scrutinise the evidence of the Complainant with great care. 
       
       
      
    121   Counsel for the appellant referred to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12, in which Lee J, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, said at p19 that a trial judge should:- 
     
      
       
        
        “stress upon the jury the necessity for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truthfulness of the witness who stands alone as proof of the Crown case. In all cases of serious crime it is customary for judges to stress that, where there is only one witness asserting the commission of the crime, the evidence of that witness must be scrutinised with great care before a conclusion is arrived at that a verdict of guilty should be brought in…” 
        
       
      
    122   See also Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 especially per Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ at 91. 
     
      
    123   Although Murray was decided before the coming into force of the Evidence Act 1995, it is clear that the principles stated by Lee J continue to apply.  
     
      
    124   It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that in the present case the Crown case on all the counts on which the appellant had been convicted depended on the complainant’s evidence alone and there was there no corroboration of the complainant’s evidence. It was submitted that the evidence of the complainant’s brother was evidence about conduct of the appellant which was not the subject of any charge and about which the complainant himself had not given evidence and was not corroborative of the complainant’s evidence about the conduct of the appellant which was the subject of the charges. In the above circumstances, notwithstanding the absence of any application at the trial for such a direction, leave should be granted under r4 to rely on this ground of appeal and the ground of appeal should be upheld. 
     
      
    125   In my opinion, contrary to the submissions made by counsel for the appellant, the Crown case did not depend solely on the evidence of the complainant. In addition to the complainant’s evidence, there was also the evidence of the complainant’s brother which I have summarised earlier in this judgment. It is true that none of the complainants brother’s evidence directly proved the commission of any of the offences charged. However, the evidence of the complainant’s brother that the appellant had entered the guest bedroom at night, had got into the bed between the complainant and B, had cuddled up to them and had lain with his penis against the complainant’s “behind” and had caused the bed to rock and that in the bedroom the appellant had put his hand down the complainant’s pants and moved his hand in a squeezing motion for about two minutes was evidence affording some support to the Crown case on all the charges. 
     
      
    126   As I have already indicated in dealing with the first ground of appeal, I consider that the summing-up, taken as a whole, would have conveyed to the jury that they had to assess the complainant’s evidence with special care and that the jury, by asking to be supplied with a transcript of the complainant’s evidence, showed that they understood the need to use special care in assessing the complainant’s evidence. 
     
      
    127   If the trial judge had given a direction of the kind which it is now submitted he should have given, fairness to the Crown would have required the trial judge to remind the jury that there was evidence independent of the complainant’s evidence which would lend some support to the Crown case and to remind the jury of the nature of that evidence. It would not have assisted the appellant for the jury to have been reminded by the trial judge of the complainant’s brother’s evidence and an unwillingness to have the complainant’s brother’s evidence recapitulated in the summing-up could explain why trial counsel did not seek a direction of the kind now contended for. 
     
      
    128   I would refuse leave to the appellant to rely on this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      3. The Trial Judge failed to direct the Jury as to what evidence could constitute corroboration of the Complainant’s evidence. 
       
      
    129   In written submissions on behalf of the appellant it was submitted that the trial judge had erred in not directing the jury about the definition of corroborative evidence and in not identifying for the jury such pieces of evidence, if any, as were capable of amounting to corroboration on the various charges. It was further submitted that the jury had not been told, as, it was contended, they should have been told, that the complainant’s brother’s evidence was not capable of amounting to corroboration of the complainant’s evidence on any of the counts on which the appellant had been convicted. The jury, it was contended, would have been left with the impression that they could, if they saw fit, regard all of the complainant’s brother’s evidence as amounting to corroboration of the complainant’s evidence on all counts. Counsel for the appellant referred to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Small (1994) 33 NSWLR 575. 
     
      
    130   In dealing with the second ground of appeal I have already stated the opinion I have formed that the complainant’s brother’s evidence, contrary to counsel for the appellant’s submissions, was capable of giving some support to the Crown case on all charges and I would not accept that, under the principles relating to corroboration at common law, the complainant’s brother’s evidence was not capable of amounting to corroboration of the complainant’s evidence on the charges on which the appellant was convicted. In his classic statement of the law on corroboration in his judgment in R v Baskerville (1916) 2 KB 658 Lord Reading CJ said inter alia at 667:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime; it is sufficient if it is merely circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime”  
        
       
      
    131   See also R v Galluzzo (1986) 23 A Crim R 211 at 215 per Street CJ. 
     
      
    132   In R v Small, the authority relied on by the appellant, Hunt CJ at CL said at 593:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Although there is no rule of law which requires the trial judge to do so, in my view it is usually preferable for the trial judge in a straightforward case such as the present one to set out exhaustively each of the matters upon which the Crown relies and which may be considered by the jury as amounting to corroboration. 
        
       
       
       … 
       
       
        
        Where the trial judge has not exhaustively set out each of those matters which may be considered as amounting to corroboration, he or she must instruct the jury as to the qualities of corroboration in such a way as to leave it beyond doubt what conditions the material must satisfy before it can be regarded as corroboration”. 
        
       
      
    133   However, R v Small was decided before the coming into force of the Evidence Act. By s164(3) of the Evidence Act it is expressly provided that it is no longer necessary to give a jury a warning about acting on uncorroborated evidence and it is accordingly no longer necessary to give a jury directions ancillary to such a warning, defining corroboration or identifying for the jury what evidence in a case is capable of satisfying the common law conditions for evidence to amount to corroboration. It will, of course, often be appropriate for a trial judge to tell a jury that they should examine the evidence to determine whether there is any independent evidence supporting the evidence of a principal Crown witness and to indicate to the jury what evidence, if any, might be regarded by them as affording such support. 
     
      
    134   In the present case the trial judge was not obliged to give directions of the kind contended for, no application was made by counsel for the appellant at the trial that such directions should be given and the trial judge did not err in not giving such directions. I would refuse leave to rely on this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      4. The Trial Judge failed to adequately direct the Jury with respect to the issue of motive, in that the Trial Judge failed to direct the Jury that even if they reject the alleged motive for a Complainant to lie put forward by the Accused, that does not mean the Complainant is necessarily telling the truth. 
       
      
    135   There was evidence at the trial which might have tended to show that the complainant (and B) had a motive to lie, that is to make false allegations of sexual misconduct against the appellant. In particular, the appellant gave evidence that he had become angry with the complainant and B for refusing to stop being flatulent in the car on 14 January 1999; that B had made a nuisance of himself by repeatedly disappearing from the church stall; that the appellant had been angry with the complainant for lying about why he had wet the bed; and that he had been angry with both boys for their misconduct in preparing to leave the appellant’s home and catching the train on the last day of their last visit. There was also evidence by the appellant of the complainant’s actions and pleasure in the embarrassing of the homosexual teacher at his school.  
     
      
    136   It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that “the inference of motive which was open to the jury was that the complainant made up the allegations because of the arguments he had with the appellant and because the appellant was very angry with the complainant on the last two days of the complainant’s final visit with the appellant”. 
     
      
    137   It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that the trial judge should have given the jury a direction that, even if they rejected the motive for the complainant to lie put forward by the appellant, that did not mean that the complainant was necessarily telling the truth. The trial judge did not give such a direction and all that the trial judge had said on the subject of motive in his summing-up was:- 
     
      
       
        
        “An accused person does not have to prove any reason or motive in any witness saying whatever he or she may have said”. 
        
       
      
    138   Counsel for the appellant referred to R v Uhrig (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 24 October 1996) in which Hunt CJ at CL said at 16-17:- 
     
      
       
        
        “What this Court said in  
        R v F 
         ((1995) 83 A Crim R 502) and  
        R v E 
         ((1996) 39 NSWLR 450) should not be interpreted as excluding arguments being put to the Jury, by either Counsel or the Judge, relating to the validity of the motive to lie which has been asserted in relation to a witness in the particular case. That is so notwithstanding that there is no such requirement for the accused to prove such a motive, although in many such cases where the evidence of that witness is vital to the Crown case it would be appropriate for the Judge to direct the Jury that, even if they reject the motive to lie put forward by the accused, that does not mean that the witness is necessarily telling the truth, and to emphasise that the Crown must still satisfy them that the witness is telling the truth”. 
        
       
      
    139   In the present case the final addresses of counsel were not recorded or at any rate are not included in the appeal papers and accordingly this Court cannot know what submissions, if any, were finally put to the jury by counsel on the subject of the complainant having a motive to lie. I would, however, be prepared to assume that some submissions on this subject would probably have been put to the jury by counsel for the appellant at the trial. I would not, however, be prepared to make any assumption about what, if anything, was said by the Crown Prosecutor and, in particular, I would not be prepared to assume that the Crown Prosecutor put any argument of an illegitimate kind. Compare R v Jovanovic (1997) 42 NSWLR 520.  
     
      
    140   No application for a direction of the kind contended for was made at the trial and, in my opinion, leave under r4 should not be granted to rely on this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    141   What the trial judge said in his summing-up on the subject of motive, which I have already quoted, was said in the context of giving lengthy directions, to which no exception has been taken, about the onus and standard of proof in a criminal trial. In the course of giving these directions his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In a criminal trial the Crown has got to prove the guilt of the accused. The accused person does not have to prove anything. Specifically, an accused person does not have to prove his or her innocence. Moreover, an accused person does not have to prove any reason or motive in any witness saying whatever he or she may have said. That is the first rule.  
        
       
       
        
        The second rule is this: The level or standard of proof required in a criminal trial is proof beyond reasonable doubt. That simply means this, before any jury can find any accused person guilty of any criminal offence, that jury must be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, of that accused person’s guilt of that particular offence”. 
        
       
      
    142   What his Honour said in this part of the summing-up would have conveyed to the jury that the appellant did not have to establish any reason or motive for the complainant to lie and, if no reason or motive for the complainant to lie had been established, the jury still had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant before they could find the appellant guilty of any offence. Elsewhere in the summing-up the trial judge made it clear that the jury could not find the appellant guilty of any offence, unless they were satisfied, to the requisite standard, of the reliability of the complainant’s and B’s evidence. Nowhere in the summing-up did his Honour, either of his own motion or by way of repeating an argument put by the prosecution, invite the jury to consider what motive the complainant would have had for making false allegations against the appellant. 
     
      
    143   In any event, in the passage in his judgment in Uhrig which was cited by counsel for the appellant Hunt CJ at CL was not purporting to lay down a universal rule. His Honour merely said that “in many cases” it would be “appropriate” to give such a direction and such a statement by Hunt CJ at CL falls short of saying that in all cases it is essential that such a direction should be given. In determining whether in the present case it was appropriate that such a direction be given, this Court can take into account that counsel for the appellant at the trial did not seek such a direction, as indicating that it did not appear to trial counsel that such a direction needed to be given. 
     
      
       
      5. The Trial Judge erred in allowing the Crown to amend Count 5 in the Indictment with respect to the dates between which that offence was alleged to have been committed. 
       
      
    144   As previously indicated, this ground of appeal was abandoned by counsel for the appellant. 
     
      
       
      6. The verdicts were unreasonable and/or incapable of being supported by the evidence. 
       
      
    145   The principles to be applied by a Court of Criminal Appeal in deciding whether this ground of appeal against conviction should be allowed have been stated by the High Court in such cases as M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487, especially at 492-494, and Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439, especially at 450-451, and there is no need to repeat them here. 
     
      
    146   Having made my own independent assessment of the evidence and allowing for the considerable advantage the jury had in seeing and hearing the witnesses give their evidence, I have concluded that on the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant on counts 2-6 inclusive. Among the matters which have led me to form this conclusion are the following:- 
     
      
    147   The complainant and B, although children, were not young children and they were giving evidence about matters which they said had happened in the comparatively recent past. The evidence of the complainant was supported in important respects by the evidence of B. Both the complainant and B had made statements to the police early in February 1999.  
     
      
    148   Although the complainant did not make a complaint at the first reasonable opportunity, he made an early complaint to Mr Menzies. Mr Menzies’ best recollection of when the complaint had been made was that it had been made in late 1998. The complaint made to Mr Menzies went into details and the complainant’s evidence and Mr Menzies’ evidence of the terms of the complaint corresponded fairly closely with each other and with the complainant’s evidence about the appellant’s conduct. Mr Menzies attended the appellant’s church and it is clear from the summing-up that no suggestion was made that he was other than an honest and accurate witness. 
     
      
    149   It would have been open to the jury to accept the complainant’s denial that there had been any real argument or conflict between himself and the appellant during the last stay at the appellant’s home in January 1999. In any event, the jury would have been entitled to conclude that it was not reasonably possible that the complainant had gone to the lengths of making false allegations of sexual misconduct against the appellant as a result of anything that had happened during the last stay at the appellant’s home.  
     
      
    150   The appellant, while denying that he had committed any of the offences charged, did not dispute many parts of the evidence of the complainant and B, for example that the complainant and B had stayed at his home on a number of occasions between early 1998 and January 1999 and that they had occupied a large bed in a guest room at the opposite end of the house from the master bedroom and that he had, at least on certain occasions, been in the bedroom with the complainant.  
     
      
    151   The jury could readily have concluded that the appellant would have been able to get up in the early morning, without disturbing his partner Mr Simons, and to find his way around a house in which he had been living for about twenty years, even if there were no lights on, without making a noise, by walking past the girandoles or otherwise, such as would have woken up Mr Simons. The jury could readily have disbelieved Mr Simons’ evidence that, after going to bed at some time between midnight and 2 o’clock in the morning, he woke up again between half past four and 5 o’clock in the morning.  
     
      
    152   The condition of the appellant’s hands did not prevent him carrying out many activities with his hands and his hands at the time the offences were alleged to have been committed in January or February or early March, especially after he had been lying in his own bed, would have been likely not to have been cold. 
     
      
    153   Counsel for the appellant submitted that the verdict of not guilty on the first count undermined the credibility of the complainant’s evidence generally.  
     
      
    154   However, the verdict of not guilty on the first count in the indictment is explicable on the basis that in the summing-up the trial judge expressly directed the jury that, even if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the alleged conduct had occurred and even if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct had occurred on the first occasion on which the complainant had stayed at the appellant’s house, nevertheless the appellant should be acquitted, unless the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct had occurred within the time frame alleged by the Crown in the indictment, that is at some time between 11 and 16 January 1998. The jury could have regarded it as reasonably possible that the first visit to the appellant’s home by the complainant had not between 11 and 16 January 1998, and on this basis acquitted the appellant on the first count, while being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all the other elements of the offence. 
     
      
    155   Apart from this matter relating to the first count in the indictment, counsel for the appellant was able to point to very little by way of discrepancies or inconsistencies in the evidence of the complainant.  
     
      
    156   In my opinion, this ground of appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    157   I have refused leave to raise, or have dismissed, all of the grounds of appeal against conviction and I am accordingly of the opinion that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Application for Leave to Appeal against Sentence 
       
      
    158   No submissions were made in support of the application for leave to appeal against sentence. The offences of which the appellant was convicted were very serious, and they involved a significant breach of trust on his part. The sentences imposed by his Honour were, if anything lenient. They could not be said to have exceeded a proper exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion. I would refuse leave to appeal against sentence.

     Regina v Robert SMITH 
      
    The appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum term of 2 ½ years with an additional term of 2 ½ years. He appealed against the conviction on the grounds that (a) the verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence; (b) the trial judged erred in failing to direct the jury as to the way in which they should deal with the competing versions of the complainant and the appellant; (c) the trial judge erred in admitting the photographic identification evidence; (d) the trial judge should have given a warning in regard to the identification evidence; (e) the Crown Prosector inappropriately posed the question of motive in the closing address and (f) the trial judge failed to give appropriate directions in regard to the question of motive posed, therefore causing a miscarriage of justice. HELD (dismissing the appeal):Ground 1: Unreasonable verdict1. This was a case in which the jury was better placed than the Court of Criminal Appeal to evaluate the reliability of the witnesses and determine if the Crown had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The events were not so extraordinary or inconsistent as to lead to their rejection on the basis that they were inherently improbable. The jury discharged their task properly as was evidenced by their request for the court to replay tapes of certain witnesses. M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487; Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439; Gipp v The Queen (1998) 72 ALJR 101; Fleming (1998) 158 ALR 379; Giam (1999) 104 A Crim R 426 applied.Ground 2 Competing versions2. Where the jury are invited to consider whether they believe the complainant (or prosecution witness) or the accused (or defence witness) they should be cautioned. This is because there is a risk that the jury may think that their task is to choose between the witnesses, and convict on the basis of who they prefer. Such a line of reasoning would dilute the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt. 3. In the instant case the trial judge gave clear and detailed directions on the requirement for the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, how the reliability of the witnesses was to be approached, and the need for the jury to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence. In so doing, the jury were not invited to choose between the complainant and the appellant’s evidence in the manner prohibited by Beserick and Edwards. Leave under r4 Criminal Appeal Rules refused.Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 considered, Edwards NSWCCA 27 September 1995 and Liberato (1984) 159 CLR 507 distinguished.Ground 3 Admission of photographic evidence4. There was nothing to suggest unfairness or risk of miscarriage associated with the identification procedure which would require rejection of the evidence under s135 or 137 of the Evidence Act. Identification of the appellant by the complainant, who she knew, was not in issue and was little more than a formality. 5. The mere fact that the identification exercise is conducted during the evidentiary phase rather than the investigation phase is not enough to exclude the evidence. There was no suggestion that anything said or done by the police may have skewed the identification. Leave under r4 Criminal Appeal Rules refused.Alexander (1981) 145 CLR 395 consideredGround 4 Absence of warning as to the identification evidence6. The nature of the direction required for identification evidence is governed by s116 and 165 of the Evidence Act. Where the identification evidence is not in issue and there is no request by the appellant’s counsel for a direction to be given, a s165 direction will not normally be required. 7. Juries should only be given those directions that are relevant to the case that they are to decide. In the instant case, the real issue was not one of identification evidence since the complainant knew the appellant, it was common ground that they had been conversing on a corner and there was a continuum of activity between the conversation and the alleged attack. Therefore, there was no risk of a miscarriage of justice in the absence of a s116 direction.Grounds 5 and 6 Motive to lie8. It is both imprudent and inadvisable to invite the jury to consider why a complainant would fabricate his or her evidence. There is a risk that it may have the effect of reversing the onus of proof by implying that in the absence of a reason for the complainant to lie, none existed. Davies NSWCCA 8 December 1994; F (1995) A Crim R 502; E (1996) 39 NSWLR 450; Uhrig NSWCCA 24 October 1996; Graham NSWCCA 2 September 1997; and Jovanovic (1997) 42 NSWLR 520; and Palmer (1998) 72 ALJR 254 applied.9. The posing of such a question may justify the setting aside of a conviction where it is endorsed as an ‘appropriate’, ‘reasonable’ or ‘proper’ question to ponder or is left in a way which gives the matter of motive prominence as an important issue. 10. Where evidence of motive for a complainant to lie is suggested by the accused, then the additional direction said to be appropriate in Uhrig NSWCCA 24 October 1996, to the effect that even if the jury reject that motive, that does not mean that the complainant is necessarily telling the truth, should normally be given. However, where the motive is offered by another witness or is offered in a half-hearted manner then the need for an additional direction is not so compelling. In such a case it may be sufficient if the jury has been directed that the accused does not have to prove his or her innocence and that they ought not speculate about matters not established on the evidence.11. Although in the instant case, the trial judge did not give this additional direction, no miscarriage of justice occurred. No complaint was made by defence counsel in relation to motive, no prominence was given to the matter, and the jury were not directly encouraged to speculate about the question of motive.

     Regina v Robert SMITH 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   GILES JA: I agree with Wood CJ at CL. 
    2   WOOD CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted, after trial, of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to S 61J (1)(2)(a) Crimes Act. The circumstances of aggravation were that, at the time of the offence, the appellant maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm on the victim. For that offence he was sentenced to a minimum term of two years six months imprisonment and to an additional term of two years six months. He now appeals against that conviction, but not against the sentence. 
     
      
     Facts 
      
    3   The Crown case was based upon the evidence of the complainant DR. She said that, on the evening of 2 May 1998, she went with some friends to the Tradesman’s Club at Dharruk, before moving on to “Tillys” nightclub at Uncle Bucks Tavern, Mt Druitt. Whilst at the nightclub she had nine to ten glasses of bourbon and coke. These were her only alcoholic drinks for the night. 
    4   At about midnight the complainant spoke to the appellant for a short time near the bar. She had seen and spoken to him on prior occasions at the club, and knew him to be a friend of her ex-boyfriend. She said that he was wearing a white, yellow and blue striped T-shirt, brown baggy jeans and brown shoes. 
    5   At about 3.30am, the complainant left the club by herself. She walked towards the Quix service station to get a taxi. When she saw the appellant standing by himself, on the corner of Mount Street, she walked over to speak to him. She said that she liked him, and he asked her if she wanted to go for a walk. She agreed, in cross examination, that the possibility of having sexual intercourse with him was in her mind at this stage. 
    6   They walked past a recreation centre to a toilet block near some soccer fields. There was no one else around. The lighting in the area the complainant described as good (an observation not challenged in cross examination either of her or of the police who made a search of the area.) They began to kiss but then unexpectedly, the appellant punched her to the left side of the face, hard, with a closed fist. She fell to the ground. When she tried to get up he punched her again, this time she thought, to the right side of her face. She landed on her back. She tried to get up but was struck for a third time, again landing on her back. On this occasion the appellant placed his finger inside her vagina and pushed “really hard”. He kept it there for some five minutes or so. 
    7   She cannot remember him saying anything to her while this was happening. Nor could she remember when or how her pants or underpants were removed. She thought that she may have lost consciousness for a time. Although she tried to sit up and push him away he kept hitting her. Eventually he got up and ran away in the direction of the nightclub. The whole incident she thought lasted for about thirty minutes. There was no attempt, she said, by the man who assaulted her, to place his penis in her vagina. 
    8   The complainant said that she found her pants and underpants on the ground but could not put them back on because she was shaking and in shock. She ran back towards the Quix service station wearing just a pink top. On the way back, a passing car stopped. She was asked by the occupants whether she was alright, and whether the police should be called. She said “yes” in reply to the latter question. By the time she reached the service station, a police vehicle had arrived. She reported the assault, and was taken back to the toilet block, where her pants and underpants were found. 
    9   She was then taken to the Westmead Hospital and examined by Dr. Robert Edwards. She was found to be very distraught, and to have a bruise, a haematoma and graze on her right forearm, a graze over the bridge of her nose, a graze and haematoma on her forehead, a tender swelling under her left eye, swelling to her lips, a small cut to the inside of her lip, and a bruise, a graze and a superficial tear to the labia. She was also thought to have a fractured nose. The genital injuries, Dr Edwards said, were consistent with “some significant degree of force” having been used. She also sustained a cut to her foot, while running back to the service station, which required suturing. She gave Dr. Edwards a history of having been assaulted by an acquaintance known to her as “Rob”. She did not make any mention to him of losing consciousness. 
    10   On 22 July 1998, the complainant was shown a video containing a number of pictures of various men not including the appellant. She did not make any identification. On 21 August 1998, she was shown a second video containing a different set of photographs, including one of the appellant that had been taken of him by police on 8th August. She made a positive identification of him. He was arrested and charged on the following day. Neither the videos or any stills from them were tendered in evidence. 
    11   The version that the complainant gave to the police when they spoke to her, in their vehicle, at the service station was recorded by them. It did not entirely accord with her evidence as to the manner in which the assault commenced.  
    12   Constable Whitely gave evidence to the effect that, after leaving the night club, the complainant said that she had walked over to the toilet block. She had gone to the toilet. Then the man had come up from behind her. He threw her to the ground. Her pants were removed and he had placed his finger in her vagina. She said that her attacker had been wearing a yellow and white striped shirt. In her notebook, the Constable also recorded: 
     
      
       
       “Victim stated that she knew the attacker as Rob only through her ex-boyfriend. He had previously tried to do the same thing to her only a matter of weeks ago.” 
       
      
    13   The complainant denied ever making this last observation to police. Constable Whitely, it may be noted, recalled that when she spoke to her, the complainant was “crying and ...shaking… She was a little bit hard to understand”. She later said that: 
     
      
       
       “She was really upset, she was crying and she was quite hysterical …” 
       
      
      
     She also described her as: 
      
      
       
        “mumbling and not being very clear”. 
       
      
    14   Constable Paterson gave evidence to similar effect, in relation to the assault. It was his evidence that when asked, as to the identity of that man, the complainant said: 
     
      
       
       “I think his name is Rob. My ex-boyfriend knows him I think”. 
       
      
      
     He also recalled the complainant as being “extremely upset, crying and shaking”. He similarly found it very difficult to understand her. He made no mention, in chief or cross examination, of her complaining of the appellant having tried to assault her previously.  
      
    15   Each officer gave evidence of finding the complainant’s pants and underpants on the ground behind the toilet block. They were wet and muddy. It had been raining that night and into the early hours of the morning, they said. 
    16   Adam Micaleff gave evidence of having seen the appellant and the complainant talking to each other, at the nightclub, on occasions before 2 May 1998. He spoke to the appellant there that night, and was informed by him that the complainant had asked him to dance with her. He left the club before the appellant, between 2.30am and 3.00am. At some time during the Sunday he received a telephone call from the appellant. When he challenged him with having raped the complainant, the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
         
          “I swear on me mother, on me daughter’s dying oath, no I haven’t, I didn’t touch her”. 
         
        
       
      
    17   Corissa Cambo gave evidence of walking towards the service station from the club, with two friends identified as Tanya and Sharon, at about 3am. She observed a girl standing on her own on the driveway of the service station. She asked if she was alright, and received the reply that she was waiting for some friends. About twenty to thirty minutes later, while waiting for a taxi, she noticed the same girl standing behind some bins at the service station, crying. She walked over and saw that she was naked from the waist down. She asked what had happened and was informed “they punched me in the face and they raped me”. When she asked who had done this, the girl kept saying the name “Rob”. She was crying and shaking. One of her friends went to call the police and one gave the girl a jacket. 
    18   Two companions of the appellant, Angelo Tseros and Glen Glover, gave evidence of leaving Tilly’s night club with him, at closing time. They said that they saw a young woman standing at the front of the service station. She was swaying slightly. She walked up to them, looked at the appellant, and asked his companions how much it would cost (to buy) their friend for the night? 
    19   At about this time they heard the sound of a window smashing and saw some bouncers from Uncle Bucks chasing a young male. They joined in the pursuit of this man, leaving the appellant behind with the girl. They ran down to the railway station before breaking off their chase. They began to return to the club but became diverted when they met up with a female, who indicated an interest in taking Mr. Glover home for the night. They turned around and walked back to the station with her. About five to ten minutes after arriving there, they were joined by the appellant. This occurred, they said, about twenty to thirty minutes after they had last seen him back at the service station. When they saw the appellant he did not seem to have any mud on his clothes or hands. 
    20   Both of these witnesses agreed that they had been drinking at the club. Mr. Tseros estimated that he had consumed about eleven or twelve vodkas mixed with orange juice during the six hours or so that he was at “Tilly’s”. Mr. Glover thought that he had consumed “maybe” five rum and cokes over the night. He also said that he had seen the complainant and the appellant speaking together at the club on prior occasions. 
    21   Melissa Lenton, the appellant’s cousin, who admitted to having drunk seven to nine glasses of bourbon and four to five glasses of beer this night, gave evidence that was somewhat inconsistent. She said, initially, that after leaving the club, she saw the appellant speaking to the complainant on the corner, just outside the club. Angelo Tseros and Glen Glover were nearby. According to her, she heard the complainant say something to the effect of, “How much would it cost me to be with you for the night?” She did not hear any response. She joined her friends at the service station, leaving the appellant and the complainant talking together.  
    22   Later in the morning she saw the appellant again talking to a fellow by the name of Darren. Fifteen to twenty minutes later, she said, Mr. Glover and Mr. Tseros arrived back at the service station. Thirty to forty-five minutes after having initially arrived at the service station, Ms Lenton said that her attention was drawn to the complainant, who was apparently standing beside the bins, absent her pants. At this time she said that the appellant was over talking to Darren in his car. 
    23   While still in chief, Ms Lenton gave some additional evidence after having her memory refreshed by reading her statement. She then said that she had seen the appellant and the complainant, earlier in the night, talking at the bar and later talking in the laneway between the entrance of Uncle Bucks and Tilly’s. She said that it was at this time, in the laneway, that she heard the complainant ask, “Can I have you?” to which the appellant replied, “No”. The complainant then said, according to her, “How much will it cost me to have you for the night?” The appellant replied, “You can’t buy me.” 
    24   She also said, at this point of her evidence, that when she saw the appellant and the complainant standing on the corner, as she walked to the service station after leaving the club at closing time, she did not hear what they were saying. Twenty minutes later she saw the appellant at the service station. He stayed there she said for about fifteen minutes before walking off towards the railway station. It was within thirty minutes of his departure that she saw the complainant standing near the bins. In cross examination she agreed that when she saw the appellant at this time, he did not have any mud on his clothes or hands. 
    25   The complainant, it may be observed, denied making any remarks that might have suggested an interest in buying the appellant, or asking how much it might cost to have him for the night. 
    26   Police interviewed the appellant, by way or ERISP, on 8 August 1998. He denied having assaulted the complainant. He said that she had approached him on the night of 2 May, and asked if she could take him home. He had refused. When she asked how much it would cost to have him for the night, he said to her, “You can’t buy me, I have a daughter and girlfriend that I love and want to go home to”. He said that she tried to force a kiss on him and to stop him going away from her. This, he said, occurred on the corner of Mount Street and the restaurant. When the brick was thrown through the club window, he used that as a distraction to walk away from the complainant, who had tried to pull him back. He then went to the railway station and caught a train with his friends. 
    27   There was no identification parade. The appellant indicated to police that he felt “it would be a waste of time”, because he knew the girl and she knew him. Following the interview, photographs were taken of him which he was informed would be used for identification purposes. He did not oppose that occurring. 
    28   The appellant gave sworn evidence to similar effect of the account given in the ERISP. In the course of doing so, he acknowledged having met the complainant on a few prior occasions at Tilly’s night club. He also acknowledged that, on this night, he met the complainant at the corner and spent about ten minutes with her there. After refusing her offer and making good his departure of her, he walked back towards the night club. After looking back and seeing that she had gone, he then walked over to the service station where he spoke to his cousin Melissa and to two other people, identified as Hayley and Darren. The interval between encountering the complainant in the street and joining these acquaintances, he fixed at between ten and twenty minutes. He later walked off to the railway station where he caught up with Glen Glover and Angelo Tseros. 
    29   In cross examination the appellant agreed that he had seen the complainant on about three prior occasions at Tilly’s, that he had danced with her on such an occasion, and that he had spoken to her in the bar area on the night of second/third May. 
    30   He also agreed that he had consumed about six bourbons and cokes that night. He denied having spoken to the complainant during the evening in the laneway, as mentioned by Ms Lenton. 
    31   The only other witness in the defence case was Nathan Lenton, another cousin of the appellant, who said that around December 1998, he had a conversation with the complainant. After being introduced as the appellant’s cousin, she said, according to him, that “at the end of the Court case, she could get fifty grand out of it”. The complainant denied this conversation when it was put to her in cross examination. There was no cross examination of the appellant in relation to it, nor any evidence of a claim for compensation having been made. 
    32   There was no issue that the complainant had been sexually assaulted this night. The defence case was that this occurred after the appellant had managed to get away from her at the time the brick was thrown through the window, and that some person other than him had been responsible. In essence, it was the defence case that the complainant’s version of events, in which she suggested that the appellant was her attacker, could not be accepted beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
     Ground 1 
      
      
     Verdict unreasonable 
      
    33   It was submitted that the verdict was not one that could be reasonably supported on the evidence: S6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, as that ground is now to be considered accordance with the decisions in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493; Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 450-451; Gipp v The Queen (1998) 72 ALJR 101; Fleming (1998)158 ALR 379; and Giam (1999) 104 A Crim R 426. 
    34   Reliance was placed upon the proposition that, after making its own independent assessment of the nature and quality of the evidence, and giving due respect to the advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the witnesses, this Court should come to the conclusion that a jury, properly instructed, ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant. 
     
      
    35   As was observed by Mason CJ, Deane and Toohey J in M: 
     
      
       
       “Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty (see  
       Whitehorn v The Queen 
        (1983) 152 CLR at 686;  
       Chamberlain v The Queen [No 2] 
        (1984) 153 CLR at 532;  
       Knight v The Queen 
        (1992) 175 CLR 495 at 504-505;511). But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations. ( 
       Chamberlain v The Queen [No 2] 
        (1984) 153 CLR at 621) 
       
      
      
     Later their Honours observed: 
      
      
       
       “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. ( 
       Chamberlain v The Queen [No 2] 
        (1984) 153 CLR at 618-619;  
       Chidiac v The Queen 
        (1991) 171 CLR 432 at 443-444). 
       
      
    36   In Jones, Brennan CJ referred to the basic principle upon which the function of an appellate Court is determined, when considering this ground of appeal, namely that it is the jury which is the “constitutional arbiter of guilt” (at p.442). He continued: 
     
      
       
       “An equation between a reasonable doubt entertained by a Court of Criminal Appeal and a doubt which ought to have been entertained by a reasonable jury is valid only if the capacity for evaluating the cogency of a witness’s evidence and the worldly wisdom of a Court of Criminal Appeal are no less than the collective endowments of a jury.”  
       
      
      
     In the same case, Kirby J similarly observed (at 94): 
      
      
       
       “the conventional assumption of the trial system in Australia, in both civil and criminal trials, is that the evaluation of truth telling is ordinarily to be performed by the tribunal of fact. It is that tribunal which sees witnesses and hears the entirety of the trial whereas the Appellate Court typically reads transcript and is taken by the parties to selected parts of the evidence, commonly read out of sequence, as the extracts seem best suited of supporting their respective arguments”. 
       
      
    37   It was submitted that the Crown case, which substantially depended upon the complainant, was so tainted with discrepancies or otherwise lacking in probative force, that this Court, even after making due allowance for the advantage of the jury, should find that it ought to have maintained a reasonable doubt. The matters of potential relevance to this submission appear to me to be the following: 
     
      
     a) the observation attributed to the complainant by Ms Combo that “ 
     they” 
      had punched and raped her; 
      
      
     b) the observation attributed to her by Constable Whitely that the appellant had attempted to do the same thing to her some few weeks previously; 
      
      
     c) the observation attributed to her by Constable Whitely and Constable Patterson to the effect that, having been to the toilet, at the toilet block, the complainant was attacked by someone who came up to her 
      from behind 
     ; and threw her to the ground (ie without any mention of having been punched); 
      
      
     d) the lack of any ready explanation for why the appellant would suddenly punch the complainant, and submit her to a forceful form of sexual assault, falling short of penile/vaginal intercourse, when she had displayed a voluntary sexual interest in him; 
      
      
     e) the absence of any evidence of mud on the appellant’s clothing and hands after the events alleged, compared with the marks seen on the complainant’s clothing; 
      
      
     f) the uncertainty, or unwillingness, of the complainant to admit that it had been raining on the night of the events alleged; 
      
      
     g) the fact that the complainant had consumed a significant quantity of alcohol during the night of 2/3 May, and had suffered a severe blow or blows to the head; 
      
      
     h) the circumstance that the complainant was contradicted by several witnesses, when denying that she had raised the possibility of paying for the opportunity of taking the appellant home with her; 
      
      
     i) the absence of any disclosure to Dr Edwards by the complainant as to a loss of consciousness; 
      
      
     j) the absence of any direct eyewitness to the alleged assault; 
      
      
     k) the possibility that, after the appellant walked away from the complainant, when the incident relating to the broken window and the pursuit of the man responsible for it occurred, some person other than him attacked the complainant. 
      
    38   These were all matters properly to be taken into account by the jury when considering the credibility and reliability of the complainant, which had a considerable advantage over us in hearing and seeing each of the witnesses who were called. None of them in isolation, or in combination, leads me to the view that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt. Nor, for the reasons later mentioned, do I have a concern that the jury were insufficiently directed as to the relevant issues, or as to the way in which they should approach the evidence. 
    39   There was no issue other than that the complainant was severely beaten, and the subject of a sexual assault that involved the forceful penetration of her vagina. The appellant was already known to the complainant and he was seen by several persons to be in her company at the relevant time. He admitted to being in her company for about ten minutes at a time proximate to the assault. In the circumstances described by those witnesses who knew him and who left him with her, while they went about their business, he had the opportunity to do what she alleged. 
    40   Several of the matters said to amount to discrepancies (items (a), (b), (c), (f) and (i) above) were readily explicable by reference to the extremely distressed and shocked state in which the complainant was left after the attack, and to the difficulty which the police officers who first spoke to her, and Dr Edwards, subsequently had in obtaining a coherent account from her.  
    41   What was consistently provided, however, was the disclosure that the assailant was the man “Rob”, who the complainant identified as the appellant. This was a matter relevant to the issue of her credibility. The complaint was instantaneous and it was consistent. Moreover, the reply “Rob,” which was given in response to Miss Combo’s inquiry as to the “they” who attacked her, is inconsistent with any suggestion made by the complainant to the effect that more than one offender was involved.  
    42   The jury were entitled to regard this part of Miss Combo’s evidence either as a misunderstanding on her part, or as an imprecise statement by the complainant, attributable to her shocked state. 
    43   Although there is no doubt that the complainant had drunk a good deal of alcohol, there was no suggestion by any witness that she was incoherent before the attack or unable to appreciate to whom she was talking, or what was occurring to her. She accepted that she was “happy” but denied being well affected by liquor or being drunk. Neither of the uniformed police suggested that she was inebriated or was cross examined to that effect. Moreover, in his opening address, Counsel for the appellant put the matter no higher than that she had consumed “a moderate amount of alcohol”. Nor was there any suggested that the blows to the head were such as to lead to any loss of memory after the event. This disposes of item (g) above. 
    44   There was no suggestion that the appellant fell to the ground, or was otherwise positioned in a way that would necessarily have led to him getting mud on his clothes or hands. At most, he was said to be kneeling between her legs. Whether that involved him placing his knees on the ground, whether the area on which he was kneeling was wet so as to attract mud to himself, and whether Messrs Glover and Tseros would have noticed any mud or wet patches on the brown jeans that the appellant was wearing, were no doubt matters properly to be considered by the jury, they were not matters that inevitably invited the conclusion contended for by the appellant. This disposes of item (e) above. 
    45   Items (d) and (h) are interrelated, and admittedly are somewhat curious. However, they were quintessentially matters for the jury which was entitled to find, for example, that the appellant was somewhat unimpressed by what may have seemed to him to have been promiscuous and unwelcome conduct on the complainant’s part, and to have responded by humiliating or degrading her in the way described, which as I have observed fell short of the penile/vaginal intercourse which might otherwise have been expected. The case is not one in which the events described were so extraordinary, or so inconsistent with the expected range of human behaviour, as to lead to their rejection as fantastic, or even as inherently improbable. 
    46   Certainly there was no eyewitness to the actual attack. Equally there was no evidence as to the presence, in the general area of the attack, of any other possible candidate for it. In those circumstances, item (j) remained a matter for the jury, as did the possibility referred to in item (k). The latter is, however, answered by the circumstance that the complainant might reasonably have been expected to have seen exactly who did attack her. If that were the appellant, then it is difficult to see how there could have been an error in identification as he was already known to her, both according to her own evidence, as well as according to the evidence of several other witnesses, including the appellant himself.  
    47   The possibility that some other unobserved patron of the night club, who was intoxicated, and in an amorous mood, was responsible for the attack, was, no doubt, hypothetically open. However, in the circumstances described by the complainant as to how it was that she and the appellant came to be at the toilet block, and as to how their kissing developed into an assault, I am not persuaded that it remained open as a reasonable possibility. Certainly the jury, by the verdict, came to believe the complainant’s version of events, which excluded any attacker other than the man to whom she began to talk after leaving the club, who undeniably was the appellant. 
    48   In the end, I am satisfied that this was a case where the jury was much better placed than this court to evaluate the reliability of the witnesses, and to come to the necessary conclusion as to whether the Crown had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt by reference, in particular, to the way in which the critical witnesses performed in the witness box. The observations of Brennan CJ and Kirby J in Jones earlier mentioned are apposite. Particularly is that so in a case where the jury were obviously at pains to discharge their task properly, as was indicated by their request to have the tapes of the evidence of the complainant, Ms Combo, and Ms Lenton, replayed. 
    49   This ground of appeal is, accordingly, not made good. 
     
      
     Ground 2 Competing versions 
      
    50   It was next submitted that his Honour erred in failing to direct the jury, adequately or at all, as to the way in which they should deal with the competing versions offered by the appellant and by the complainant. There was no complaint in relation to this aspect of the summing up raised at trial, and leave is accordingly required to argue it. 
    51   As was observed by Brennan J, with whom Deane J agreed, in their dissenting judgments on a special leave application in Liberato (1984) 159 CLR 507 at 515: 
     
      
       
       “When a case turns on a conflict between the evidence of a prosecution witness and the evidence of a defence witness, it is commonplace for a judge to invite a jury to consider the question: who is to be believed? But it is essential to ensure, by suitable direction, that the answer to that question (which the jury would doubtless ask themselves in any event) if adverse to the defence, is not taken as concluding the issue whether the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt the issues which it bears the onus of proving. The jury must be told that, even if they prefer the evidence for the prosecution, they should not convict unless they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of that evidence. The jury must be told that, even if they do not positively believe the evidence for the defence, they cannot find an issue against the accused contrary to that evidence if that evidence gives rise to a reasonable doubt as to that issue.” 
       
      
    52   Although their Honours were in the minority in this decision, the relevant passage has been taken up elsewhere as requiring the relevant direction, where a case is left upon the express basis suggested - ie as a case of word against word, in which a jury is invited to consider which of the complainant (or prosecution witness) and the accused (or defence witness) they believe: Edwards NSWCCA 27 September 1995 at p8, and Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 at 528; and see also E (1995) 89 A Crim R 325 at 330 and Towner (1991) 56 A Crim R 221, at 228-229. 
    53   The inappropriateness of ever leaving a case upon that very blunt basis, without the necessary caution, is obvious, since it risks leaving the jury with the belief that their task involves one simply of choosing between the two witnesses, justifying a conviction if they come to prefer the evidence of the prosecution witness to that of the accused. The vice lies in the circumstance that such an approach may dilute the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt, and divert the jury from that fundamental principle of law. 
    54   Whether or not a case has been left in such blunt terms will depend upon a reading of the summing up as a whole: Short [2000] NSWCCA 452. In Liberato, as Brennan J noted, at 514, there had been a failure, in the summing up, to distinguish between “reasonable doubt and choosing between two contradictory stories”. The matter was compounded by various other directions which Brennan and Deane JJ considered may have effectively reversed the onus of proof. 
    55   This ground of appeal drew essentially upon the following passage in the summing up: (p 11 on 8th June) 
     
      
       
       “What you are required to do in finding the facts is not very different from what each of us commonly does individually, although perhaps subconsciously in our day to day lives we are commonly confronted with situations where different people give us different versions of something that has happened.  
       Sometimes the situation is one where, for one reason or another, we have to choose between those different versions. 
        In such everyday situations we probably make up our decisions without spelling out in our minds just how we are doing it. However, such are the conflicts in the evidence in this case and so important is your task that it is desirable that I should take a few minutes to analyse briefly how the process works, or should work.” 
       
      
    56   This followed upon clear and detailed directions (at pages 6 to 7 of the summing up on 7th June) as to the fact that the onus of proof fell upon the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt , and as to the fact that there was “no onus of proof on the accused at all”. In the course of giving that direction, which included a conventional direction as to the presumption of innocence, the jury were also instructed: 
     
      
       
       “The accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt in your minds. It is vitally important that you clearly understand that the accused must be acquitted if his guilt has not been proved to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt . You do not have to be satisfied that the accused is innocent before you should acquit him. If you are unable to decide where the truth lies, even though you feel that he may be guilty if you have a reasonable doubt about it you must find him not guilty.” 
       
      
      
      
      
     The essence of those directions was repeated when his Honour continued the summing up on 8th June. 
      
    57   Immediately following the passage earlier mentioned his Honour gave careful directions concerning the way in which the reliability of witnesses was to be approached. This was followed by a Murray direction, (1987) 11 NSWLR 12, in the course of which all of the matters relevant for an assessment of the complainant’s reliability were identified. When summarising the address of defence Counsel, his Honour repeated the various matters that had been identified as potentially damaging to the Crown case, as well as those capable of supporting the defence case, before again reminding the jury of the need “to scrutinise (the complainant’s evidence with great caution” (summing up 8th June p29). 
    58   I am not persuaded that the question for the jury was framed in terms inviting them to choose between accepting the evidence of the complainant and that of the appellant, in the way that was said to be prohibited in Beserick and Edwards, that is in the absence of the additional directions mentioned in Liberato. 
    59   Hunt CJ at CL said in Edwards (at 8-9): 
     
      
       
       “It is commonplace for the issue in cases such as the present to be described as one of word against word. Sometimes it is unavoidable. But it is essential that, when such a description is given, the judge ensures that the jury understands that it is  
       not  
       a question of making a choice between the evidence of the Crown’s principal witness and that of the accused. The best approach, in addition to saying just that, is to tell the jury that the Crown case depends upon them accepting that the evidence of its principal witness was true beyond reasonable doubt notwithstanding the (sworn) denial by the accused, and that they do not have to believe that the accused is telling the truth before he is entitled to be acquitted.” 
       
      
    60   That was a case where the trial Judge, on more than one occasion, informed the jury that the “real issue” was whether they believed the complainant or the accused, an error that was compounded by a direction that as part of the choice, the jury had to decide beyond reasonable doubt whether they accepted or rejected the evidence of the accused. 
    61   The present case is very different. I am not persuaded that read in its full context, (including the Murray direction) the summing up risked watering down the burden that rested upon the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. In that regard, it is important to note that the reference to choosing between different versions (para 54 above) was not related to the present case. Rather it was a general observation made in the course of some preliminary directions. At no stage was the issue for the jury expressed in the stark form evident in Edwards.  
    62   Nor was anything else said that risked watering down the requirement that the jury find the complainant’s allegations true beyond reasonable doubt before they could return a verdict of guilty. Similarly to the decision of this court in Short (see par 73 - 75), I am satisfied that the correct question was kept in the forefront of the jury’s mind. 
    63   This ground is not made good, and I would refuse leave under R4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1952. 
     
      
     Ground 3. Admission of photographic evidence 
      
    64   It was submitted that his Honour erred in admitting the evidence of the photographic identification, by the complainant, of the appellant, on 21 August. Again there was no objection by trial Counsel in relation to this evidence and R4 applies. 
    65   I have some difficulty in understanding the point sought to be made in relation to this ground of appeal, and in relation to the following ground, since the identification by the complainant of the appellant, as the person who she knew as Rob, was simply not in issue. On her account, there was a continuum of activity between their conversation on the corner, including her acceptance of his invitation to go for a walk, which took them to the toilet block where they kissed, immediately following which she was struck, and sexually assaulted.  
    66   The case was not pursued as one depending upon the identification of a man who was previously unknown to her, or of a man who suddenly came upon her and who she saw only briefly. She had given a contemporaneous account as to his first name, and as to his clothing. The photographic identification had a relevance only in confirming that the man, whom she had referred to as “Rob”, was in fact the appellant. In that respect it had an obvious relevance. It could not have had any possible prejudicial effect since it was common ground, based upon the evidence of the independent witnesses, as well as that of the appellant, that the person to whom she had been speaking on the corner was indeed the appellant.  
    67   An argument advanced on appeal was that the identification exercise was tainted because it was conducted during the evidentiary phase, rather than during the investigative or detection phase of the case. Additionally, it was put that the procedure was tainted by the separate identification exercises that were undertaken, by the delay, and by what was said to have been the showing of only a limited number of photographs to the complainant. 
    68   There was no cross examination to provide a proper basis for any such complaint, nor as I have observed, was there any objection to the evidence. That this matter was regarded as little more than a formality, in view of the fact that the complainant and the appellant were known to one another, is established by the circumstance that neither the videos or stills from them were tendered, or shown to the jury. 
    69   So far as the timing of the identification procedure was concerned, reliance was placed upon various passages in Alexander (1981) 145 CLR 395, particularly in the dissenting judgment of Stephen J. That decision confirmed the desirability of identification being effected through an identification parade, as near in point of time as possible to the offence, ie whenever that is possible. It also dealt with the care needed for photographic identification, so as to avoid contamination through the effects of suggestion, displacement and the like, and so as to avoid conveying any impression to the jury that the accused was already known to police as a person who had committed similar offences, or was a person already in police custody. 
    70   The observations of Gibbs CJ (at 401) need to be understood in that context. His Honour there said: 
     
      
       
       “… it is most undesirable that police officers who have arrested a person on a charge of having committed a crime should arrange for potential witnesses to identify that person except at a properly conducted identification parade. Similarly, speaking generally, an identification parade should, wherever possible, be held when it is desired that a witness should identify a person who is firmly suspected to be the offender. However, there is little support to be found in the authorities for the view that a conviction must necessarily be quashed if it is based on evidence that the accused was identified other than at an identification parade at a time when he had been charged or was definitely suspected, even though there was no valid reason why an identification parade could not have been arranged. The judgment of this Court in  
       Davies and Cody v The King 
        (1937) 57 CLR 170 suggests that the proper approach is to consider whether the conviction can safely be sustained on the whole of the evidence.” 
       
      
    71   His Honour noted a number of cases in which convictions had been sustained where the identification had been made post arrest, and where it had been made through the use of photographs. His Honour continued (at 402-403): 
     
      
       
       “The authorities support the conclusion that I have reached, which is that, as a matter of law, evidence of an identification made out of court by the use of photographs produced by the police is admissible. However, a trial judge has a discretion to exclude any evidence if the strict rules of admissibility operate unfairly against the accused. It would be right to exercise that discretion in any case in which the judge was of opinion that the evidence had little weight but was likely to be gravely prejudicial to the accused. In a case such as the present it seems to me proper for a trial judge, in deciding how he should exercise his discretion, to take into consideration that it is the duty of police officers investigating crime to take every precaution reasonably available to guard against the miscarriages of justice that can occur, and have in fact occurred, because of honest but mistaken evidence of identification, and that for this reason ‘only in exceptional cases should photographs be used at a stage when some particular person is directly suspected by the police and they are able to arrange an identification parade or some other satisfactory alternative means whereby the witness can be asked directly to identify the suspected person’:  
       Reg v Russell 
        [1977] 2 NZLR at 28.” 
       
      
      
    72   This decision has been applied in many subsequent decisions, and special provision now exists in the Evidence Act 1995 dealing with picture identification (S 115), and identification evidence generally (SS 116 and 165), all of which are designed to avoid unfairness. However, neither the passage cited from the judgment of Gibbs CJ in Alexander, or the judgment of Mason J in the same case, stand as authority for the rigid proposition advanced by the appellant that would only permit evidence of an identification if it were made during the detection phase. The judgment of Mason J, (at 430 to 431) is to the contrary of any such proposition. 
    73   Even if there were a principle of the kind suggested in the dissenting judgment of Stephens J, it may be observed that, in this case, the relevant photographic identification took place before arrest, and it achieved nothing more than a confirmation of the identification of the person known to the complainant and previously identified by her as “Rob”. 
    74   There was no cross examination to suggest that the procedure followed, or that the selection of photographs used was such as to suggest that the appellant was in police custody, or that anything was said or done by the police that might have skewed the identification, or that might have given rise to concerns associated with the “rogues gallery effect”. In short, there was nothing in this case to suggest any unfairness or risk of a miscarriage of justice associated with the identification procedure that might have attracted, or required, a rejection of the evidence under SS 135 or 137 of the Evidence Act, or otherwise. 
    75   I would refuse leave to argue this ground. 
     
      
     Ground 4 - absence of warning as to the identification evidence. 
      
    76   It was next submitted that, as evidence of the 21 August identification had been received, then it was obligatory for his Honour to give directions to the jury relating to the need for caution generally, as well as in the circumstances of the particular case, by drawing their attention to any matters of significance that might have undermined the reliability of the evidence that was led: Clout NSWCCA 1 December 1995; Mark Anthony Clarke (1993) 71 A Crim R 58; and Kerrie Anne Clarke (1997) 97 A Crim R 414. 
    77   The matters of significance relating to the present case were said to concern the complainant’s sobriety or lack of it, her state of consciousness, and the “external prevailing conditions of the time”. 
    78   The nature of the direction which is now required, in relation to identification evidence, is dictated by sections 116 and 165 of the Evidence Act. S 116(1) provides, relevantly: 
     
      
       
       “116 (1) If identification evidence has been admitted, the judge is to inform the jury: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) that there is a special need for caution before accepting identification evidence; and 
       
      
      
       
       (b) of the reasons for that need for caution, both generally and in the circumstances of the case.” 
       
      
    79   Section 165 requires a warning to be given in relation to identification evidence where requested by a party (S 165(2)), unless there are good reasons for not doing so (S 165(3)). 
    80   Section 116(1) is expressed in terms which this Court, in Kerrie Anne Clarke, suggested (obiter) were not qualified by the exemption provided by S 165 (3). To the extent that this is correct, it would involve a departure from the common law noted in Domican (1992) 173 CLR 555 and Heuston (1995) 81 A Crim R 387. 
    81   As I have observed, there was no real issue as to identification, the relevant evidence having been led, without objection, as follows: 
     
      
       
       “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Now [DR] do you recall going to the Mount Druitt police station some time in August of 1998? And being shown a video? A. yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And was it the case that the video had a number of pictures of various men? A. yeah. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Do you remember picking out a picture whilst that was being done? Whilst that was being shown to you? A. Yeah. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And did you tell the police which number you picked out? A. yeah. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Each one of them being numbered? A. yeah I think so 
       
      
      
       
       HIS HONOUR: Well, its a bit unclear there Mr -- 
       
      
      
       
       CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, certainly your Honour. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. The person that you picked out, who was it? A. Robert Smith. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Did you have any difficulty in picking him out? A. No.” 
       
      
    82   Moreover, there was no request by trial Counsel for the S 165(2) direction which, it is now submitted, should have been given. 
    83   Viewed literally, every criminal trial involves identification evidence within the wide meaning given to that phrase in the dictionary to the Evidence Act. The evidence of any eyewitness who gives evidence, based upon his or her own observations, that the accused was present at the place where the offence charged occurred, falls literally within that definition. Yet common sense would suggest, in such a case, where such evidence was not in issue, that there would little if any point served in giving the S 116(1) direction.  
    84    Whether the observations in Clarke at 424 to 425, concerning the apparent universal and mandatory application of S 116(1) require reconsideration, need not, however, be decided here.  
    85   If there were error by his Honour in not giving the directions suggested, then the case would be one where an application of the proviso would be appropriate. The reasons for this are straightforward. 
    86   This was a case where the appellant was known to the complainant as Rob, where it was common ground that they were conversing on the corner, and where it was the complainant’s evidence that they walked together from that position directly to the place where, within moments, the assault occurred. It is impossible in those circumstances to see what relevant or helpful direction could have been given to the jury concerning her identification of the man she already knew as Rob. 
    87   It needs to be firmly borne in mind that juries need those directions that are relevant to the case that they are to decide and only those directions. To embark upon some general excursus concerning substantive or procedural law, unrelated to a live issue, is more likely to confuse than to assist, and should always be avoided. 
    88   The real issue for the jury was not one of identification, but whether they could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the truth of the complainant’s account of what occurred after she began to talk to the appellant. Her sobriety, her state of consciousness and her general reliability as a witness were relevant to that issue. They were dealt with expansively in relation to that issue in the summing up. They were not, however, relevant to her photographic identification of the man who she knew as Rob, the sole purpose of which was to confirm that he was the appellant. 
    89   In those circumstances, no risk of a miscarriage of justice arose by reason of the absence of any directions in relation to the photographic identification that was conducted at the police station. This ground of appeal is not made good. 
     
      
     Grounds 5 and 6 - motive to lie 
      
    90   In the course of his address, the Crown Prosecutor dealt with the complainant’s nomination, to Ms Combo, and to Constable Whitely, of the person “Rob” as the person who had just assaulted her. He continued: 
     
      
       
       “Now that’s what she’s telling Constable Whitely moments after she’s fled from this scene near the toilet block. Now is she making it up members of the jury? I tell you I think not. If so, why? Why would she be making this up? I suppose there are many answers to that and I certainly don’t ask you to speculate because she tells you who did it; she tells you it’s this person Rob, a person that she doesn’t know particularly well, but knows him well enough to recognise him and also knows it’s him because he’s the bloke she went to the toilet block in the first place when she was fully aware as to what she was doing in terms of being quite keen on the fellow and being prepared to go along with him. So she knows who it was.” 
       
      
    91   Later in the address, the Crown Prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
       “You will recall the evidence of the accused himself. I asked him some questions as to whether there was any animosity, I think I said, or disagreement or something like that, between he and DR; there was none, they were friendly. Members of the jury DR is not making up first the fact of these things happening to her, nor the second as to who did them to her. She has no reason to in my submission to you members of the jury and she has not made it up.” 
       
      
    92   The invitation to the jury that was said to arise from this submission gave rise to the fifth ground of appeal, it being submitted that it led to a miscarriage of justice. The manner in which it was dealt with by his Honour gave rise to the sixth ground of appeal, it being submitted that his Honour failed to give appropriate directions to the jury concerning the argument advanced. 
    93   The posing of a question, in the course of a closing address, that is designed as an invitation to the jury to consider why the complainant would be making her evidence up, is both imprudent and inadvisable, that is where the question of motive has not been ventilated in the evidence. This follows from the decisions of this court in Davies NSWCCA 8 December 1994; F (1995) 83 A Crim R 502; E (1996) 39 NSWLR 450; Uhrig NSWCCA 24 October 1996; Graham NSWCCA 2 September 1997 (reversed on other grounds 1998 HCA 61); and Jovanovic (1997) 42 NSWLR 520; and of the High Court in Palmer (1998) 72 ALJR 254. 
    94   However, what was said by the Crown Prosecutor, in this case, must be viewed in context, and in particular by reference to the fact that he made it clear to the jury that they were not to speculate about the matter. Understood in its full context, the Crown Prosecutor was conveying the message that the complainant had no reason to make up the allegation and was not doing so. He did not directly suggest to the jury that they should ask the offending question of themselves. 
    95   When his Honour came to deal with this part of the address in the same context in which it had arisen, ie in relation to the complaint to Constable Whitely, he did so in a way that did also not pose the question in a prohibited way. What he said was this: 
     
      
       
       “The Crown agrees that there are two versions by Ms Ross but the Crown says however that the version is consistent with the offence occurring and refers to the yellow and white stripe shirt that was being worn by the accused on that night. However, you may recall the evidence in relation to the trousers. Ms Ross says that on one part of the evidence that he has baggy brown trousers on and I think she tells the police that she does not recall what he was wearing on the bottom, again that is a matter for you. The Crown also says “ 
       Well look, is she making it up?” The Crown then goes on to say “Well, ladies and gentlemen, you are just not to speculate”.  
       And you may recall the directions I gave you about not guessing or speculating, you must determine this matter on the evidence that is before you.” 
         
       
      
    96   The potential vice in posing the kind of question, discussed in the cases earlier mentioned, lies in the fact that it is a rhetorical question that implies its own answer, namely that in the absence of a reason being identified for the complainant to lie, none existed. It risks consciously or unconsciously reversing the onus of proof, so far as it might imply, unless accompanied by a direction to the contrary (Palmer at 258), that it is for the accused to provide a reason or motive, and that if he or she cannot do so, then the complainant can all the more readily be accepted. 
    97   As Sperling J, pointed out in E (at 462) the absence of motive cannot be inferred from the absence of evidence of motive, yet to pose the question is to give legitimacy to a line of reasoning that would support such an inference. Moreover, an unfairness can arise so far as a question, posed in such terms, may leave an accused accountable for failing to discern a motive in the mind of the complainant, even though no ready or reliable means exists of accessing another person’s mind to discern the reasons for what he or she does or says. (see E at 464). 
    98   As a matter of common sense and everyday experience of life, one of the first matters that will occur to the jury is the prohibited question - why, unless it is true, would the complainant make the allegation up and go through all the trouble and stress to himself or herself, as well as to the accused and their respective families, that would be associated with an investigation and trial?  
    99   The reality of that circumstance has not been overlooked by appellate Courts, e.g. F at 511 per Gleeson CJ; Robinson (1996) 1 VR 402; Palmer Vic CA 10 September 1996; Rodriguez (1997) 93 A Crim R 535 at 553 per Callaway JA; Graham at 28 per Levine J and Jovanovic per Cole JA at 527-528 and especially by McHugh and Kirby JJ at 269 and 276 in Palmer.  
    100   Notwithstanding, the rigours of the criminal law have held the line by reference to the foundational principle that it is for the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt , and not for the accused to prove his innocence. The only exception allowed has been where a motive to lie has been asserted, on the part of the complainant, or by some other witness essential to the prosecution case, or where such a motive could reasonably be inferred from the evidence. In such a circumstance, justice requires that it be dealt with, and that the jury give consideration to the question whether there was a reason for the complainant to lie. 
    101   As Hunt CJ at CL said in Uhrig at 16-17: 
     
      
       
       “A motive to lie where it does exist is a very relevant factor in judging a witness’s credit. It will almost inevitably have substantial probative value in relation to the issue of credit, and so will pass the test posed by S 103 of the Evidence Act 1995 for admissibility. If the alleged motive is denied by the witness, other evidence may be led to rebut that denial in accordance with S 106. 
       
      
      
       
       What this Court said in  
       R v F 
        and in  
       R v E 
        should not be interpreted as excluding arguments being put to the jury, by either counsel or the judge, relating to the validity of the motive to lie which has been asserted in relation to a witness in the particular case. That is so notwithstanding that there is no requirement for the accused to prove such a motive, although in many such cases where the evidence of that witness is vital to the Crown case it would be appropriate for the judge to direct the jury that, even if they reject the motive to lie put forward by the accused, that does not mean that the witness is necessarily telling the truth, and to emphasise that the Crown must still satisfy them that the witness is telling the truth.” 
       
      
    102   In the various decisions, where the prohibited question has resulted in a conviction being set aside, it has been left in a way giving the matter prominence as a “central theme or issue”, see F at 15-16; Rodriguez at 541, 544, and 549, or endorsing its legitimacy or otherwise describing it as an “appropriate” or a “reasonable” or “proper” question to ponder: see E at 454 and 467; Rodriguez at 542; and Jovanovic at 538. 
    103   That was not how his Honour dealt with the matter in the present case. Moreover, the immediate response to the question supplied by the Crown Prosecutor and repeated by his Honour, in my view, served sufficiently to overcome the potential problem. 
    104   The relevance and permissibility of cross examining a complainant to establish motive (but not the cross examination of an accused to show a lack of awareness of any motive unless its existence has already been raised by him), was confirmed in Palmer (per Brennan CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 257-258, and per Kirby J at 275 and 278). 
    105   The correctness of the passage in Uhrig cited above, as a statement of the law, was also recognised in Jovanovic per Priestley JA at 522. His Honour went on to explain that the reference, in that passage, to it being “appropriate” for the trial judge to give the direction as to what should follow in the event of the jury rejecting the motive, appeared to him to have been a reference to it being something that should necessarily be done. 
    106   Although some support for this view exists in the judgment of Kirby J in Palmer at 275, I would prefer to read the expression in a less rigid way, leaving it to the trial Judge to frame a direction suitable to the way in which, and the firmness with which, the possibility of motive has been opened up on the evidence, and in the closing addresses. In some cases, particularly where the motive is offered by the accused himself or herself, then the additional direction would normally be appropriate, lest the jury think it proper to penalise the accused for offering a reason which they find to be spurious or hollow, or designed unfairly to denigrate the complainant. 
    107   Where the evidence of a possible motive comes from another witness, or where the matter arises in some half-hearted way, in passing, as I believe it did in this case, then the need for the additional direction will not be so compelling. In such a case it may well be sufficient if the jury has been properly and fairly instructed that the appellant does not have to prove his or her innocence, it being for the Crown to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and that they ought not to speculate about matters that are not established upon the evidence. 
    108   The possibility of a motive for giving false evidence did in fact emerge, by inference, in the course of the cross examination of the complainant when she was asked about a conversation with Nathan Lenton, which allegedly took place at Tilly’s night club, in December 1998. 
     
      
       
       “Q. And do you recall an occasion when Nathan Lenton was with Jacko and Adam at Tilly’s nightclub in or about December of last year? A. No. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And I suggest to you that you were introduced to Nathan as Robert’s cousin. Do you remember an occasion when that occurred? A. No. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And I suggest to you that you said to him that after you were finished with Robert you wanted fifty thousand dollars? A. No. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. That conversation took place didn’t it? A. No. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Did it take place anywhere? A. No. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You see I suggest to you that you were saying to Nathan words to the effect that you were going to get Robert? A. No.” 
       
      
    109   In the way in which the cross examination was developed, particularly in the absence of any direct question suggesting that the contemplation of monetary gain provided a motive for the complainant to pursue the claim, and to give false evidence, it would seem to have been more directed towards an issue of credit. However, it was capable of raising an inference as to motive, at least for persisting with the allegation; although possibly not for the initial complaint unless the complainant had been particularly venal in setting out, from the very beginning, to establish a case for compensation - in which event the plan went terribly wrong for her. 
    110   The defence called Nathan Lenton in its case, to contradict the complainant’s denial. He gave evidence of a conversation along the lines put to the complainant, although this occurred, he said, at Colours nightclub at St Mary’s, rather than at Tilly’s. There was no objection to the evidence which, in any event, could have been called as an exception to the general rule that a witness’s evidence, on a question going to credit cannot be contradicted by other evidence noted by Brennan CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Palmer at 257, or alternatively as a matter going to a fact in issue (per McHugh in Palmer at 265). 
    111   In cross examination, Mr Lenton agreed that the complainant had given no indication to him on this occasion, of having made up her account of the assault. There was no other evidence touching upon this aspect of the case. 
    112   For completeness I add, since it is a material consideration for the way in which the case was left, that the appellant gave no evidence suggesting the existence of a motive on the part of the complainant to lie, and was not cross examined in a way inviting him to offer one. At the highest, he was asked to agree, and did agree, that he and the complainant had been on friendly terms. This occurred in the context of questions designed to show that they knew each other, and that he was aware that she liked him - he agreed to having “had some indication” of that. This had a direct relevance so far as it tended to support the complainant’s version that they went for a walk and kissed, after their meeting on the corner. 
    113   The Crown Prosecutor did not deal with the Lenton conversation in his address at all. However, counsel for the accused did take it up, after emphasising the need for the jury to “pull (the complainant’s) evidence to bits, (to) scrutinise it, (and to) put it under the magnifying glass”, and to look for any support for it, as well as for any matters that supported the defence case. This occurred in the course of his analysis of the matters which, he suggested, should leave the jury with a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s credibility and reliability.  
    114   When he came to the evidence of Mr. Lenton, and her denial, he said: 
     
      
       
       “What do you do with that? Is it a motive perhaps? Who do you believe on that? Why does she deny it? Why does she deny it but she does. ‘How much would it cost me to have you for the night?’, words to that effect. She says ‘Nuh’, never said it. The accused said it happened on many occasions in his interview and in his evidence. Angelo says it happened. Glen says it happened. Melissa said it happened. What do you do with that? So you give him the benefit of the doubt, that’s what you do with it. That’s what you’re required to do. Why would she deny saying it? It’s all odd. It’s very odd. Her whole evidence is odd. It’s not enough.” 
       
      
      
    115   When his Honour came to this matter in his summing up it was dealt with in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “Well just in relation to that just let me tell you this, ladies and gentlemen, that most cases where there are victims of crime they are entitled to make an application for victims compensation. That is to be determined by usually a tribunal, and so whether she was to receive $50,000 or not, and you have seen the injuries she received, she may well have been entitled to receive 50,000 or less, but that is beside the point. I think Mr. Cattini was saying to you that in fact this lady was bragging about it, that she is going to receive $50,000. But as I said in relation to that people are entitled to make an application for it, whether they get it or not is quite a different thing.” 
       
      
    116   These directions did no more than provide an explanation by which the jury might have better understood the significance of any mention by the complainant of an expectation of receiving $50,000, ie if there had been such a mention. His Honour refrained from giving any direction at this point in relation to motive, or from raising the rhetorical question. 
    117   Admittedly he did not go on to give the additional directions that were said to be “appropriate” in Jovanovic where motive is raised by the defence. However, I am not persuaded, in view of the way that the matter was left, that there was any risk of a miscarriage of justice in its omission. Certainly there was nothing to suggest that if Mr. Lenton’s evidence was not believed, then that might rebound to the discredit of the defence case. If anything, the directions that were given tended to assist the defence since they provided the background against which the relevant conversation might be understood. 
    118   The absence of any complaint by trial counsel in relation to the matters, now sought to be raised in these grounds, the lack of prominence given to the matter of motive, and the absence of any encouragement given directly to the jury to ponder upon the question ‘why would the complainant lie’, leads me to the conclusion that, in the context of this trial, there was no error or risk of a miscarriage of justice. I would refuse leave under R4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. 
    119   For these reasons I do not consider that any ground of the appeal has been made good. In my view the appeal should be dismissed, and the conviction and sentence below confirmed. 
    120   JAMES J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL.

     Regina v David Quoc Diep 
      
      
      
     Judgment 
    1     SIMPSON J: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
       
      
    2     HIDDEN J: The applicant, David Diep, pleaded guilty in the District Court before Viney DCJ to two charges of supplying heroin (s25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985). Both charges involved amounts in excess of the indictable quantity and each carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for fifteen years. He asked his Honour to take into account offences of possessing a prohibited weapon and possessing ammunition on a Form 1. On the first charge, Judge Viney sentenced him to imprisonment for a fixed term of two and a half years, to date from 27 May 1999, the date he went into custody. On the second charge, taking into account the Form 1 matters, his Honour sentenced him to imprisonment for five years, comprising a minimum term of three years, also to date from 27 May 1999, and an additional term of two years. 
     
      
       
      
    3     The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. He was also sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for six months on a charge of affray, to which he had earlier pleaded guilty, but leave to appeal against that sentence is not sought. 
     
      
       
        
       Facts 
        
       
      
    4     Early in 1999 the applicant and a man named Van Sang Nim were under police surveillance, and an undercover police officer had made contact with them. On 2 March 1999 the applicant met the undercover officer in the central business district of Sydney, having arranged to sell him 56gm of heroin. The officer showed him $8,400 in cash as part payment for the heroin. At the applicant’s direction, the officer drove to another location and they met Mr Nim, who supplied the heroin in a package. The balance of the purchase price, $2,000, was paid on a later occasion. 
     
      
       
      
    5     Another transaction took place in similar circumstances on 16 April 1999. On that occasion 28gm of heroin was supplied for $5,200. 
     
      
       
      
    6     On 26 May 1999 police executed a search warrant at the applicant’s family home, where they found a baton with a side handle, some twelve gauge shotgun ammunition and some ·22 calibre bullets. It is these items which gave rise to the charges on the Form 1. The applicant was not present at the time of the search but was arrested on the following day. On legal advice, he declined to be interviewed. 
     
      
       
      
    7     Before us, a foreshadowed argument that the applicant’s role in the two drug offences was less than that of Mr Nim was abandoned. Mr Byrne SC, who appeared for him, explained that the applicant has been in this country since his early childhood, whereas Mr Nim had arrived here very much more recently. The applicant has a good command of English, and it was for that reason that he undertook the task of contacting the undercover officer and arranging the transactions, leaving it to Mr Nim to produce the heroin. Accordingly, said Mr Byrne, the applicant accepts that he is as culpable as Mr Nim.  
     
      
       
        
       Subjective matters 
        
       
      
    8     The applicant is now twenty-two years old and was twenty-one at the time of the offences. He has no prior convictions. However, at that time he was on bail in respect of the charge of affray to which I have referred. It should be noted, on the other hand, that he had been subject to that bail order since mid-1996, when that offence was committed, and he had not otherwise come under adverse notice during that period. 
     
      
       
      
    9     He came to this country with his family when he was not quite three years old. The family had escaped from Vietnam, travelling by boat to Hong Kong, where they spent more than a year in a refugee camp. Upon arriving here, they spent some six months in a migrant hostel. His father worked hard to establish himself in this country, eventually setting up a clothes manufacturing business and, later, a Vietnamese restaurant in Cabramatta. The applicant has four sisters, none of whom have been in conflict with the law and all of whom have been successful in their endeavours in education and employment.  
     
      
       
      
    10     It seems that the applicant’s difficulties have arisen from his contact with undesirable associates. He enjoys the continuing support of his family, and his father is able to provide employment for him upon his release from prison. The subjective material as a whole persuaded his Honour that there were special circumstances calling for a departure from the usual proportion between minimum and additional terms. 
     
      
       
        
       The application 
        
       
      
    11     Written submissions furnished prior to the hearing focussed on the argument that the sentences are manifestly excessive, having regard to decisions of this Court and sentencing statistics supplied by the Judicial Commission. However, at the hearing Mr Byrne disclosed that he had just received information that the co-offender, Van Sang Nim, had himself been dealt with by Goldring DCJ and had been sentenced to a term of periodic detention. The matter was adjourned so that Judge Goldring’s remarks on sentence could be obtained and further written submissions on the question of parity of sentence could be supplied.  
     
      
       
      
    12     Judge Goldring sentenced Mr Nim to two and a half years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of eighteen months, to be served by way of periodic detention. (His Honour did not express that sentence to be applicable to each of the charges, but I assume that to have been his intention). He took into account the fact that Mr Nim had spent three months in custody. It seems that the material before his Honour was somewhat spare, a fact of which he complained when passing sentence, although it did include Judge Viney’s remarks on sentence in respect of the applicant. 
     
      
       
      
    13     Judge Goldring dealt with Mr Nim on the basis that the applicant was “much more heavily involved” in the offences than he. Mr Nim had given evidence that on both occasions he acted at the behest of the applicant, receiving minimal remuneration. Indeed, the effect of his evidence was that he was unaware that the first transaction of 2nd March 1999 involved a prohibited drug. That evidence does not sit easily with his plea of guilty to that charge. 
     
      
       
      
    14     At the time of sentence Mr Nim was twenty-five years old. He had no previous convictions and had the benefit of a supportive family. Judge Goldring said of the applicant that he “may have had a criminal record”. His Honour must have overlooked that part of Judge Viney’s remarks in which he observed that the applicant “has no prior matters”.  
     
      
       
      
    15     Without doubt, there is a marked disparity between the sentences imposed on the applicant and Mr Nim. Effectively, the applicant was sentenced to a full-time custodial term of five years with a minimum term of three years, while Mr Nim faces a term of periodic detention of two and a half years with a minimum term of eighteen months. That disparity would warrant a reduction of the applicant’s sentence if it were such as to engender in him a justifiable sense of grievance, in accordance with the principles examined by the High Court in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 and revisited in Postiglione v The Queen (1996-7) 189 CLR 295. 
     
      
       
      
    16     The Crown prosecutor in this Court submitted that the sentence passed upon Mr Nim is manifestly inadequate, although he acknowledged that the Crown had not appealed against it. True it is that Judge Goldring sentenced Mr Nim upon the basis that his culpability was much less than that of the applicant. However, it appears that his Honour did so on the basis of limited material about their respective roles, and it may be that Mr Nim was the beneficiary of more favourable treatment on that account than he deserved: cf Reg v Hodges (CCA, unreported, 20 August 1997). On the whole of the material now before us, no clear distinction between the roles of the two men could be drawn. The case highlights the desirability of co-offenders being sentenced by the same judge, whenever possible. 
     
      
       
      
    17     True it is, also, that the applicant’s sentences were concurrent with the six month term imposed in respect of the charge of affray, that he was on bail in respect of that charge at the time of the drug offences and that there were further offences to be taken into account on a Form 1. These matters warranted a distinction between the sentences passed upon the two men and rendered the imposition of a full-time custodial sentence upon the applicant inevitable. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the disparity between their sentences is excessive and, for that reason alone, the applicant’s sentences must be reduced. It becomes unnecessary to consider the argument originally advanced that they are, in any event, manifestly excessive.  
     
      
       
      
    18     I would allow the appeal and quash the sentences passed in the District Court. The applicant must be re-sentenced in accordance with the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Like Judge Viney, I think it appropriate that the sentences on the two charges should be concurrent, the second charge carrying the heavier sentence. I am also satisfied that there are special circumstances warranting a non-parole period less than three quarters of the term of the sentence for that charge: s44(2) of the Act. 
     
      
       
      
    19     On the second charge, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, I would sentence the applicant to imprisonment for three years, to date from 27 May 1999, with a non-parole period of eighteen months. On the first charge, I would sentence him to imprisonment for eighteen months, also to date from 27 May 1999. I would decline to set a non-parole period in respect of that sentence because of the sentence passed on the second charge: s45(1)(b) of the Act. In accordance with s50(1), I would direct the applicant’s release on parole at the end of the non-parole period, subject to the supervision referred to in s51(1A). The applicant would be entitled to release on parole on 27 November 2000.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JThursday, 23 November 200070050/00 - REGINA v William Charles McGARRITYJUDGMENT1   HIS HONOUR: William Charles McGarrity has pleaded not guilty to three charges, namely that between 27 and 30 January 2000 at San Remo he murdered Jessica Ellen Gallagher, that on or about 30 January 2000 at San Remo he had sexual intercourse with Carmelina Angilletta without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting and that at the same time and place he maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm upon Ms Angilletta. He has elected for trial by judge alone and the Crown has consented to that form of trial. I am satisfied on the evidence contained in the report of Dr Jeremy O’Dea written on 16 November 2000 that the accused has the capacity so to elect. 
     
      
    2   The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did the acts which constitute the offences but he admits all the facts relied on, so there is no doubt about those matters. The accused contends that he is not guilty of any offence because at the time of the events giving rise to the charges he was mentally ill and therefore not legally responsible for his actions. He must prove that it is more likely than not that that was so. 
     
      
    3   The statement of the test for a defence of mental illness was propounded as long ago as 1843 in R v McNaghten. The question to be answered was whether the accused at the time the offence was committed was suffering from a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind, so as not to know the quality and nature of the act he was doing or, if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. The law has been amplified in Australia in the present century and the test may be said to be whether the accused was able to appreciate the wrongness of the act that he was doing. If through disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. It may also be said that if a disease of the mind so governs the faculties that it is impossible to reason with some moderate degree of calmness about the moral quality of an act, the actor is prevented from knowing that what he does is wrong. 
     
      
    4   The accused was born on 18 July 1961. He grew up in a family of several children. His father was alcoholic and probably suffered from some kind of mental illness. He was a violent man, particularly towards the accused. He beat him often until the accused was big enough to hit back. The accused appears as a result to have had a difficult and unhappy childhood. He attempted suicide at a young age. He grew up with a short temper and a rebellious nature. During a short period of service in the army he suffered a spinal injury. During his early twenties he suffered a further spinal injury in one of two serious motor vehicle collisions. He was not academically inclined but had been strong and fit and interested in sport. His injuries and the resulting disabilities made it difficult for him to follow his desired pursuits and caused him pain when he did so. He began to become despondent. In about 1990 a twelve-month relationship with a woman broke up and he entered upon a long cycle of mood changes between happiness and depression to the point of being suicidal. His father died in 1994 and he took the death hard. He became interested in spiritualism and spoke to others who had such interests. He began to believe psychics who told him that he was a great healer. Some time after 1996 he told his brother that he then understood why their father had bashed them. It was because he had loved them and wanted to make them strong. For the same reason he, the accused, had suffered his accidents. He continued - 
     
      
       
        
        That’s why I was crucified. That’s why I’ve come back to help people, to cure people. 
        
       
      
    5   He told his brother that he was Jesus, God. He showed him designs for futuristic machines, healing pyramids, houses in the sky and the like. His brother arranged for him to be admitted to Mandala Psychiatric Clinic at Gosford and he was kept there for three weeks and treated with medicine. After his discharge he continued to believe strongly in his ability to heal. He formed two further relationships with women, one of whom shared his psychic beliefs. He was medicated on and off. He was hearing voices. He had changed from a neat and orderly person to an unkempt person. Following a spiritual quest overseas he returned to Australia with long hair, a beard and flowing clothes. 
     
      
    6   In October 1999 the accused was admitted involuntarily to Mandala following a fight over money. Although the magistrate committed him to that institution for three weeks, he left after ten days. The diagnosis at that time appears to have been bipolar affective disorder and/or schizo-affective disorder. 
     
      
    7   Dr Chaussivert, a psychiatrist at the Mandala Clinic, reports that the accused had a history of aggression towards mental health staff at the clinic. 
     
      
    8   In November 1999 Carmelina Angilletta was a widow living with her four year old daughter Jessica Ellen Gallagher at a house in San Remo. Ms Angilletta’s husband had died in 1997. The accused was at the premises doing labouring work for a contractor who was carrying out renovations. He and Ms Angilletta became friends. He told her that he was a healer and seemed to offer the kind of reassurance and companionship Ms Angilletta needed. They became friends and in December 1999 he moved into the house to live with them. Ms Angilletta fell in love with him and came under his influence. On one occasion he sang her a song about being nailed to the cross. Ms Angilletta asked him whether he were Jesus and he said that he was. He continued to refer to himself as Jesus in such a way that Ms Angilletta came to believe it. By various manipulative methods he drove a wedge between Ms Angilletta and her family, including by telling her untrue things about them and by accusing them of serious misconduct. He also claimed to be Nostradamus and to be called Dragar. He said that he was a holy child. 
     
      
    9   He came between Ms Angilletta and Jessica and assumed the role of teaching and disciplining the child. He said that she was an alien from Uranus and had come to kill Ms Angilletta. On another occasion he said that she had come to kill him. He said that she was possessed by the spirit of her dead father. 
     
      
    10   Members of Ms Angilletta’s family became concerned about the deterioration in the relations between them and Ms Angilletta and about the part the accused appeared to be playing in these changes. Ms Angilletta’s sister and the accused’s brother jointly approached the Mandala Clinic with a view to having the accused admitted for treatment and on 27 January 2000 an acute care team from the clinic went to the house, accompanied by two police officers. The accused, who was adept at dealing with such circumstances, smoothed the matter over, and the team formed the view that admission to the clinic was not warranted. On the same evening the accused insisted that Ms Angilletta and Jessica join him in a series of bizarre rituals including drinking urine and wearing white robes. He told Ms Angilletta that he was going to the dog pound to “get dad”. He returned with a large black dog and told her that it was his father, God, which, of course, is dog spelt backwards. After that his behaviour became even more eccentric. He accused the child of stealing one of his rings and said that it was inside her. He examined her faeces to try and find it. When he could not he said that God had turned the ring into faeces. 
     
      
    11   During all this time the accused prevailed upon Ms Angilletta to withdraw substantial amounts of money and make it over to him. As instructed, she used it to purchase unusual things and objects for use in shrines that he set up. The description of his other bizarre behaviour is long and detailed and it is inappropriate here to recount the particulars of it. He continually made bizarre and inconsistent statements of fact and behaved increasingly cruelly towards Ms Angilletta and the child, apparently in obedience to voices he was hearing. 
     
      
    12   The third count concerns an incident in which the accused armed himself with a sword, handed another sword to Ms Angilletta and required her to engage him in combat. She was incapable of doing so. He struck at her with his sword, cutting various parts of her body. He hit her repeatedly about the head and body and used the handle to strike her in the mouth, smashing some of her teeth. 
     
      
    13   The killing of the child happened in this way. The accused began hitting her about the neck and body with his sword. He directed Ms Angilletta to run hot water into the bathtub and she did so. The accused made the child get into the bath and resisted her attempts to get out until she stopped struggling. He pulled her out of the bath and left her on the mat. The child was making no sound and was probably dead by that time. He put her body into the refrigerator. He later told Ms Angilletta that the child would be restored to life when God (the dog) licked her. 
     
      
    14   The child died because of the infliction of multiple injuries, including blunt force injuries to the face and trunk. There was subarachnoid haemorrhaging. There was extensive scalding injury to almost the entire body, but the clinical signs suggested that by the time those injuries were inflicted the child was either dead or incapable of reacting to pain. 
     
      
    15   The accused then directed his attention to Ms Angilletta who, at the accused’s command, had taken a bath and was naked. He put her in a wooden chest, placed a rope around her neck and pulled it tight, hacked off her hair, banged her head into a garage roller door and placed items of frozen food on her naked body. He heated a spoon with a cigarette lighter and applied it to various parts of her body, as well as inserting it into her vagina. That last act was the basis of the second count. 
     
      
    16   The neighbours called the police. They arrived and had to subdue the accused with capsicum spray before taking him into custody. 
     
      
    17   Following his arrest the accused was formally interviewed by investigating police officers and I have watched and listened to a video tape of the interview. The accused spoke and behaved in such a bizarre manner that nothing useful was able to be achieved. He was remanded in custody and taken to the psychiatric ward of Long Bay Prison Hospital, where he has remained to the present time. He has been seen by a number of medical practitioners including Dr Westmore, Dr Lucas and Dr Nielssen, psychiatrists. Dr Westmore and Dr Lucas were qualified on behalf of the defence and Dr Nielssen on behalf of the Crown. 
     
      
    18   Dr Westmore interviewed the accused and studied an extensive range of documents relevant to the matter, including a statement of Ms Angilletta and a transcript of the recorded interview between the accused and the police. Dr Westmore also viewed the video tape. He reviewed clinical notes of the treatment of the accused over the years, including his presentation and treatment at the Long Bay Prison Hospital after his arrest. Dr Westmore is of the view that the accused was psychotic immediately before and at the time of the events giving rise to the charges. His bizarre and extreme behaviour as described by Ms Angilletta was psychotic behaviour, as were his beliefs about his own identity and powers, the identity of the dog and in other respects. The overall impression Dr Westmore received from the video tape of the interview was of an individual who had decompensated and was in a state of extreme regression. On the evidence of the interview alone he would require the accused to be admitted to hospital for observation. 
     
      
    19   Dr Westmore’s opinion is that the accused suffers from a schizophrenic illness, the differential diagnosis of which includes a schizo-affective disorder or a primary mood disorder with psychotic features. He observed that the accused could not provide any sensible explanation or understanding about his previous mental state, though he acknowledged some resolving psychotic features in the form of auditory hallucinations and ideas of reference, as well as previous delusional beliefs. The clinical notes available from the prison medical records and the accused’s slow response to treatment by anti-psychotic medication was, Dr Westmore thought, consistent with a diagnosis of psychotic illness. 
     
      
    20   Dr Westmore is of the opinion that the accused was mentally ill at the time of the events leading to the death of the child Jessica. He is of the opinion that the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind, specifically a schizophrenic illness, which totally deprived him of the capacity to know that he ought not do the acts he did or that the acts were wrong. 
     
      
    21   Dr Lucas reviewed a similar range of documents. He is of the opinion that the accused suffers from a long-standing severe psychotic disorder. He thinks that the persistence of delusional beliefs and unusual behaviour suggests that paranoid schizophrenia is likely to be the principal diagnosis, though another possibility is schizo-affective disorder. Although the diagnosis of bipolar disorder appears to have been the one usually made during the accused’s admissions to the Mandala Clinic, the pattern of illness suggests to Dr Lucas that there was more than that to be said about the accused’s mental condition. Dr Lucas is of the view that the accused was acutely psychotic at the time of the acts leading to the death of Jessica. He is of the opinion that at the time of the offence the accused was suffering from a severe psychotic disorder, most probably paranoid schizophrenia but possibly schizo-affective disorder, but that for legal purposes the exact nature of the diagnosis is not important. The accused was delusional and his behaviour was severely disturbed. His actions were in accordance with his delusional beliefs. At the relevant time although the accused probably knew the nature and quality of his actions he was unable, because of his disease of the mind, to reason about the wrongness of his actions with a moderate degree of sense and composure. 
     
      
    22   Dr Nielssen reviewed the same material. He formed the opinion that the accused had been suffering from a relapsing psychotic illness since at the latest 1996. Although earlier episodes were characterised by pervasive elevation of mood, the accused later developed a delusional belief that he was the reincarnation of Jesus and experienced schizophreniform symptoms such as auditory hallucinations, thought broadcasting and delusions of reference in the absence of elevated mood. Dr Nielssen is of the opinion that the history and the corroborative information available shows that the accused was acutely mentally ill at the time of the events giving rise to the charges as a result of an acute episode of a relapsing illness, recognised to be a disease of the mind. He was suffering from a defect of reason, that he was Jesus and was able to raise people from the dead, and also that the child Jessica had become possessed by an alien and the spirit of her dead father. His defect of reason resulted in the accused being unable to recognise that his actions in harming the child and her mother were morally wrong. His acutely aroused and confused state prevented him from reasoning about the consequences of his actions with any degree of composure. 
     
      
    23   In my opinion the accused has proved on this material that at the time of the events giving rise to the three charges he was mentally ill and has the defence of not guilty on the ground of mental illness available to him. He must therefore be found not guilty of each of the charges. 
     
      
    24   It is necessary to say a number of other things, however. The events giving rise to these charges have been distressing and perplexing for Ms Angilletta and her family and the accused’s family. The sympathy of the Court goes out to those family members and others who have been touched by these tragic events. 
     
      
    25   The statute which governs cases like this requires me to make an order that the accused be detained in such place and in such manner that the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law. In practice that will mean that the accused will be referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1990. A strict statutory regime will then come into effect. 
     
      
    26   The Mental Health Review Tribunal is a body of professional experts. Within 14 days after the verdict the Tribunal will commence a review of the case of the accused. When it has done its review the Tribunal will make a recommendation to the Minister for Health. That recommendation may be either unconditional or subject to conditions as to the manner in which the accused should be detained, cared for or treated. If the Tribunal is satisfied that the safety of the accused or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by his release, it may make a recommendation as to his release. If it makes such a recommendation that will be considered by the Department of Health which in turn will advise the Governor-in-Council. The Governor-in-Council will then, in accordance with the recommendation and advice, either make an order for the detention of the accused or for his release, conditional or unconditional. The Governor-in-Council may only make an order for release where the Tribunal itself has recommended release. Assuming that no recommendation for release is made after the first hearing the Mental Health Review Tribunal can at any later time, and must at least once every six months, review the case of the accused. 
     
      
    27   After hearing the evidence at any later review, it must make a recommendation to the Minister for Health as to the continued detention, care or treatment of the accused or as to his release, conditional or unconditional. The Tribunal is not free at any such review to make a recommendation for release unless it is satisfied that the safety of the accused or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by his release. Again following such a review and recommendation the matter goes to the Department of Health and the Minister advises the Governor-in-Council. Any recommendation so advised can be carried into effect only by order of the Governor-in-Council. 
     
      
    28   If the accused were at any time released back into the public on conditions and there were a breach of any of those conditions, the Governor-in-Council might order that the accused be apprehended and detained. Such an order would follow by reason of the practical consideration that if a person were released, the Department of Health would maintain a watch over his case with the assistance of a Community Health Centre, a private psychiatrist, or one of the other public facilities available. In other words, if a person is released conditionally back into the community, then the Department maintains a watch over him and a breach of any condition will lead to his being apprehended and detained once again. 
     
      
    29   The conditions which could be applied include matters such as living in a particular place, taking particular medication and so on, to ensure that the accused was properly cared for. Other than pursuant to any such release, the accused would remain, as I have said previously, in strict custody within one of the psychiatric institutions catering for forensic patients. 
     
      
    30   The only manner in which a person ceases to be a forensic patient for the purposes of these provisions is when he is unconditionally released by the Governor-in-Council, or is released upon conditions which include a condition as to the time that his release should become unconditional. If that time expires, then his release becomes unconditional and he ceases to be a forensic patient. However, as I previously explained, the accused will never be released unless the Mental Health Review Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence available to it that his safety and the safety of any member of the public will not thereby be seriously endangered. 
     
      
    31   I find that the accused is not guilty of any of the charges by reason of mental illness. I order that he be detained in a hospital until released by due process of law.

     REGINA v ROBERT NEIL KENNEDY 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   STUDDERT J: The appellant, Robert Neil Kennedy, appeals against his conviction in relation to two sexual offences as to which the jury found him guilty following his trial in the Dubbo District Court in February of this year. 
     
      
       
      
    2   The indictment contained three counts: the first count as initially framed charged him with having sexual intercourse with LAM without her consent knowing that she was not consenting and charged that this offence occurred “on or about 29 July 1981”. The second count charged him in the alternative with carnal knowledge of LAM at that same time. The third count charged him with having sexual intercourse with LAM without her consent knowing that she was not consenting between 1 June 1986 and 30 June 1986. 
     
      
       
      
    3   The appellant was arraigned on 21 February 2000 but the trial was adjourned to 23 February 2000. On that date the Crown Prosecutor applied to amend Counts 1 and 2 by substituting for “on or about 29 July 1981” the words “between 29 July 1981 and 23 April 1983”. Counsel for the appellant did not object to the amendment and the trial judge allowed it. Upon arraignment on the amended indictment the appellant pleaded not guilty and the trial then began. 
     
      
       
      
    4   Following convictions on Counts 1 and 3, the appellant was, on 7 April 2000, sentenced on each count to imprisonment for two years eight months commencing on 7 April 2000. A non parole period of eighteen months was set to expire on 6 October 2001. The appellant does not seek leave to appeal against the sentence imposed but challenges his conviction upon ten grounds in the grounds of appeal filed and he seeks to rely upon an eleventh ground not expressed in the grounds filed. 
     
      
       
      
    5   Before addressing the various grounds of appeal it is necessary to review the evidence and the issues presented at the trial. 
     
      
       
      
    6   By way of background, the complainant was born on 20 March 1969. The appellant is her stepfather. The complainant lived with her mother, her siblings and the appellant at the time both offences were alleged to have been committed. 
     
      
       
      
    7   The appellant denied that the act of intercourse charged in the first count occurred. In relation to the third count, the act of intercourse was not denied by the appellant but the appellant’s case was that the complainant consented to the later act, or at least there was absent any knowledge that the complainant was not consenting. 
     
      
       
      
    8   The proof of the prosecution case depended upon the evidence of the complainant, whose credibility was very much in issue. According to the complainant, she never liked the appellant and he used to abuse her physically as a child, hitting her with objects such as a belt, a thong and a piece of plastic tubing. There was one time when she said she was stabbed with a fork. 
     
      
       
      
    9   The complainant’s account as to the commission of the two offences of which the appellant was found guilty was as follows. 
     
      
       
        
       Count 1 
        
       
      
    10   The complainant said that when she was approximately twelve years old she was watching television in the family home in Albury. The wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana was being televised. According to the complainant, the appellant and her two younger brothers were in the lounge room but the brothers were asleep on the floor. The appellant took her into her brothers’ bedroom, put her on the bed and then took her pants off. The appellant then had penile-vaginal intercourse with her. The complainant said that she bled following this and the following morning complained to her mother, pretending that she was menstruating. The complainant said that her mother gave her some pads. The complainant said that subsequently she pretended for years that she was having her periods, although this did not commence in fact until she was sixteen years of age. 
     
      
       
      
    11   The complainant gave evidence that when she went to school on the day following this incident (or, as conceded in cross examination, it could have been as long as two weeks later), her friend TS saw the pads in her bag and the complainant then told TS that she had been bleeding because her father was interfering with her. 
     
      
       
        
       Count 3 
        
       
      
    12   The complainant then gave evidence about the later offence the subject of the third count. The complainant said that on an occasion in June 1986 when she was alone in the home where the family was then living at Broken Hill, the appellant called her into his bedroom, removed his singlet and asked her to squeeze pimples on his back. After this the complainant said that the appellant grabbed her by the shoulders, and placed her on the bed. The appellant removed his trousers and lay over her. The complainant’s evidence was that before doing so he had removed her clothing also, including her underwear but in cross examination the complainant said that she removed her own clothing because the appellant told her to do so. The appellant proceeded to have penile-vaginal intercourse. The complainant said that during this activity the bedroom door had been closed and a butter knife had been placed in the beam of the door to prevent it from being opened. After intercourse the complainant said she noticed “white stuff” on her leg and around her vagina. The complainant had told the appellant that she did not want the intercourse to occur but had made no physical movements to resist because she was scared. The complainant said she told the appellant her brother would be home from school soon and also that her mother would be home soon. 
     
      
       
      
    13   In the course of cross examination the complainant agreed that in her statement to the police she had made no reference to the appellant’s request to her to squeeze the pimples on his back, nor to her clothes being removed, nor to the appellant removing his clothing as in her evidence before the jury. In her statement to the police the complainant had asserted that the appellant had intercourse with her three times on this particular day but her evidence before the jury was that it had only happened once. 
     
      
       
      
    14   The complainant subsequently discovered she was pregnant and a child was born to her on 11 March 1987. Indeed, altogether the complainant had three children and the appellant acknowledged that he was the father of all three children. The child born on 11 March 1987 was the first of these. 
     
      
       
      
    15   The other witnesses called in the prosecution case were the complainant’s mother, TS and the police officer who ultimately conducted the interview of the appellant. 
     
      
       
      
    16   The complainant’s mother gave evidence that was inconsistent with the evidence given by the complainant in a number of respects. One point of inconsistency was that the mother said that the appellant had a very good relationship with the complainant and that he never hit any of the children. Another point of inconsistency was that, contrary to the complainant’s evidence, the mother said that she was at home when the royal wedding was televised and that she had watched this event with her children, including the complainant. Also present according to the mother, were her mother-in-law and the appellant who had his arm in plaster at that time. The mother said that it was definitely the first screening of the wedding that she recalled although she said the wedding was shown more than once. The mother denied that the complainant had told her that she was bleeding soon after the royal wedding was screened and she denied that she gave her daughter any sanitary pads shortly after the wedding was televised. She said that the complainant told her when she started her periods and that was when she was at high school when she was fourteen or fifteen. 
     
      
       
      
    17   The complainant’s mother also gave evidence relevant to the third count. The mother said that she observed a change in the relationship between the complainant and the appellant after they went to live at Broken Hill in 1985. She said that the appellant and the complainant started to go everywhere together and that a couple of months before her daughter’s state of pregnancy became apparent she said that she saw the complainant and the appellant in her bedroom and that the complainant was on top of the appellant and that they were having intercourse. The mother said that her daughter told her that she was “going with” the appellant who did not want the complainant’s mother any more. That conversation was denied by the complainant. 
     
      
       
      
    18   According to the mother, the family continued to live in the same house and although the appellant slept with the complainant most of the time, the mother continued to have a relationship with him. 
     
      
       
      
    19   TS gave evidence that she was at school with the complainant in 1983 but not 1981. TS could not recall the complainant ever saying anything to her about her father interfering with her and she did not support the complainant concerning the conversation which the complainant alleged she had had with her. 
     
      
       
      
    20   The appellant was arrested by police and interviewed on 2 March 1994, which it is to be observed was some thirteen years after the commencement of the period during which the offence charged in the first count is said to have occurred. In the course of the interview the appellant denied that he had ever had sexual relations with the complainant. 
     
      
       
      
    21   The appellant gave evidence. He described his relationship with the complainant as being a good one but that after they moved to Broken Hill she made advances to him and eventually he fell in love with her. The appellant admitted to commencing to have a sexual relationship with the complainant in Broken Hill and he said the complainant fell pregnant after the third or the fourth time that they had had sexual intercourse. The appellant said he had sexual intercourse with her many times over a period of five years but this was always consensual. He said he had lied to the police in the ERISP because he wanted to find out what was going on. 
     
      
       
      
    22   The appellant said that the complainant gave him a watch and a ring and the complainant admitted that she had given the appellant a ring. Her evidence was that the ring had the inscription “Dad, love [L]”. According to the defence case, the ring had engraved the words “Love forever [L]”. The appellant said that the relationship with the complainant had ended and he was once again in a very close relationship with the complainant’s mother. 
     
      
       
      
    23   The other evidence in the appellant’s case was introduced by way of affidavit. One of these affidavits was from a solicitor from the Aboriginal Legal Service who at one time had the conduct of the appellant’s case. He deposed that the appellant had provided him with a ring with a view to its use in evidence at the pending trial and that the ring had the words engraved upon it “Love forever Letitia”. This solicitor had resigned from the Aboriginal Legal Service and no longer had possession of the ring or the photographs of it which he had arranged to be taken. A second affidavit from a solicitor with the Western Aboriginal Legal Service said that no ring and no photographs could be located in the office of the Aboriginal Legal Service. 
     
      
       
      
    24   A statement was read to the jury from a woman who at one time had been going out with one of the complainant’s brothers in Broken Hill and who lived in a flat behind the complainant’s home in Broken Hill for three to four months. According to this witness, she observed the appellant and the complainant to have a close relationship and she said she would often see the complainant seated in the front seat of the car with the appellant whilst the complainant’s mother would sit in the back seat. 
     
      
       
      
    25   Evidence was also introduced in the appellant’s case that the royal wedding was screened live on 29 July 1981 between 6.44 pm on that date and 1.42 am on the following morning. 
     
      
       
      
    26   Against this review of the evidence, I turn to consider the various grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 1: A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the granting of leave to the Crown to amend the indictment by enlarging the period during which it was alleged that the offence charged in Count 1 was committed 
        
        
       Ground 2: A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the Crown putting to the jury a case not based upon the evidence admitted in the trial 
        
       
      
    27   It is convenient to consider these two grounds together. 
     
      
       
      
    28   The trial judge allowed the Crown to amend the indictment after having been informed that there was no objection to this course by the accused. However, in discussion which followed and before the appellant pleaded to the charges as amended, it became apparent that the reason why the Crown wanted to move from alleging a specific date for the commission of the offence charged in the first count to a lengthy period within which it was to be alleged the offence occurred, was because of evidence which it was anticipated would emerge in the prosecution case: 
     
      
       
        
       (a) From the complainant’s mother that she was at home watching the royal wedding on television at a time when the complainant’s evidence placed her as absent from the house playing bingo. The royal wedding was on a Wednesday and it was anticipated that the mother’s evidence would be that bingo was on a Saturday. 
        
        
       (b) From TS that she was not in Albury in July 1981 or indeed until 1982. (As the evidence at the trial emerged, TS was not at the same school as the complainant until 1983.) 
        
       
      
    29   It is submitted on the appellant’s behalf that the failure of trial counsel to object to the amendment demonstrated incompetence but whether this be so or not, it is the responsibility of this Court to determine whether, having regard to the way in which the evidence emerged and to the way in which the trial was conducted, the amendment of the indictment resulted in a miscarriage of justice. In my opinion it did. 
     
      
       
      
    30   Both the complainant and her mother gave evidence that they saw the live telecast of the royal wedding. The complainant said her mother was not at home; her mother said she was, and this was on the night of the alleged commission of the offence charged in Count 1 before that count was amended. The Crown sought to avoid the difficulty with which it was confronted by making the amendment and then advancing as a submission to the jury that what was seen could have been a replay (even though the mother said that what she saw was definitely a live telecast).  
     
      
       
      
    31   The evidence of TS to the effect that she did not know the complainant before 1983 created a further difficulty for the Crown because it placed her evidence in direct conflict with that of the complainant that the complainant spoke of the appellant’s misconduct when she saw TS at school at a time just after having seen the royal wedding on television. If what the complainant saw was a live telecast, her evidence could not stand with that of TS. If the offence occurred on 29 July 1981, but no complaint was made until 1983, such complaint might well not then have been regarded as recent, and evidence of it would not have been properly admissible under s 66 of the Evidence Act: Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606. If what was seen was, contrary to the complainant’s evidence, a replay, there was room for avoidance of conflict and much better prospects for admitting evidence of recent complaint. The jury was invited by the Crown to conclude that what the complainant had seen was a replay and the trial judge reminded the jury of the Crown’s submission on p 18 of the summing up: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The Crown says in relation to the wedding ceremony, well because it does not sit with some other evidence you might conclude that it came at a later date, it was a replay…” 
         
        
       
      
    32   That reference in the summing-up accords with the passage of the transcript of the Crown Prosecutor’s address to the jury to which the Court’s attention has been drawn in the course of oral submissions today. 
     
      
       
      
    33   There are cases where time has been made of the essence of the offence. This was such a case, because the complainant, was insistent that the offence occurred on the same day as the royal wedding, and she was also insistent - she said she was 100% sure - that she witnessed a live broadcast of that royal wedding just before the commission of the offence. The complainant’s evidence as to the commission of the first offence made the time of such commission essential to the acceptance of her evidence and was crucial in the sense referred to by Gleeson CJ in R v VHP (unreported, NSWCCA, 7 July 1997) where the Chief Justice said at 15: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “As a general rule, what the Crown needs to establish in order to obtain a conviction are the essential facts alleged in the indictment, and if the Crown fails to establish an inessential fact, or a particular which has been provided before the trial, or which emerged from the evidence of Crown witnesses, that is not fatal. However, that generalisation may, in any given case, need to be qualified. Two examples of possible qualifications are of present relevance. First, in some circumstances the requirements of procedural or substantive fairness may restrict the capacity of the Crown to depart from particulars. Second, the evidence in a case may be such that it would not be open to a jury, acting reasonably, to treat one part of the Crown case as reliable, and another part as unreliable."" 
         
        
       
      
    34   It does not seem to me that it was possible to treat the complainant’s evidence as reliable as to the commission of the offence if it was not reliable as to the date upon which she said it occurred. Yet the effect of the amendment was to obscure this difficulty and the amendment resulted in the jury being left to consider a Crown submission contradicted by the evidence of the complainant that what she was watching on the night of the offence was a replay of the royal wedding rather than a live telecast. It seems to me that the amendment resulted in unfairly depriving the appellant of the possibility of an acquittal which the indictment prior to amendment would have presented. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 3: The trial of the appellant miscarried by reason of the conduct of the presentation of the case by the Crown Prosecutor 
        
       
      
    35   This Court has today been taken to passages of the transcript of the address of the Crown Prosecutor to the jury. The appellant complains that in his address the Crown Prosecutor asserted, in commenting on the evidence of the complainant’s mother, that this witness endeavoured in her evidence to protect the appellant, and was doing her best to look after his interests. The Crown, in its written submissions placed before this Court, has conceded that the Crown Prosecutor did address the jury in the manner as to which the appellant complains. The reference in the transcript to which the Court has been taken today revealed that this complaint made by counsel for the appellant was soundly based. 
     
      
       
      
    36   This witness was called in the Crown case. The Crown Prosecutor did not put any questions to the witness such as would have afforded her the opportunity to answer the suggestions that she was trying to protect the appellant and that she was doing her best to look after his interests. Nor did the Crown seek to lay any ground work for questioning on such matters by making an application pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act. The result was that the witness was given no opportunity to respond to the Crown assertions. 
     
      
       
      
    37   There can be no question but that the Crown Prosecutor had a responsibility to present the Crown case properly and fairly. Unfortunately what the Crown Prosecutor did in relation to this witness departed from proper and fair presentation. Fairness not only to the witness but to the appellant required that the witness should have been afforded the opportunity to address the substance of the critical submissions later made to the jury. Since the Crown Prosecutor did not afford the witness the opportunity to meet these assertions later put to the jury, there was no justification for their being made. 
     
      
       
      
    38   The responsibilities of a Crown Prosecutor were considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in two recent decisions in cases, unhappily involving this same Crown Prosecutor: see R v Kneebone 47 NSWLR 450 and R v Walton [1999] NSWCCA 452. In Kneebone the court had occasion to consider the duty of the Crown Prosecutor in determining what witnesses should be called. In that case the principle that the Crown Prosecutor is responsible for ensuring that the case is presented with fairness to the accused and to the court was emphasised. In the later case of Walton that principle was given added emphasis in a judgment of Greg James J with which the other members of the court agreed. In Walton a witness was called in the case for the Crown and the Crown Prosecutor asked her nothing more than her name, address and occupation but in the subsequent address to the jury the Crown Prosecutor impugned the credit of the witness in circumstances in which, as the Crown conceded on appeal, the prosecutor had not put the matter about which criticism was to be made to the witness. This conduct on the part of the Crown Prosecutor resulted in stern criticism in the Court of Criminal Appeal: see in particular the judgment of Greg James J at paras 38-49. 
     
      
       
      
    39   It may be that the Crown Prosecutor was not aware of what had been said in Kneebone and Walton when the present trial was being conducted but whether he was or not, it seems to me that the conclusion is inescapable that the conduct under consideration on this ground led to a miscarriage of justice. I reach that conclusion notwithstanding the Crown’s submissions to the contrary. The Crown has today submitted that what was put to the jury by the Crown Prosecutor did not invite the jury to do something that they may not have been going to do or may not have done anyway. It cannot be assumed that the jury would have done what the Crown invited them to do about this witness. The jury may well have been influenced by the submissions complained of to reject evidence that the witness gave which was favourable to the appellant’s case and which impacted on the credibility of the complainant. I have in mind in particular evidence which the witness gave on the following matters: 
     
      
       
        
       (i) the appellant’s treatment of the complainant when she was a young child; 
        
        
       (ii) the evidence of the witness as to being present with the complainant when the live telecast of the royal wedding was seen; 
        
        
       (iii) her evidence that the complainant did not complain to her following that telecast that she was bleeding and associated with the absence of such a complaint that the witness did not provide the complainant with sanitary pads; 
        
        
       (iv) the evidence that the witness gave of discovering the complainant and the appellant together in circumstances tending to indicate the complainant’s consent to sexual intercourse at a time relevant to the offence charged in the third count. 
        
       
      
    40   Counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial did not seek any direction from the trial judge about the offending submissions and the trial judge gave no direction which addressed the matter. However, as I see it, notwithstanding a failure by counsel to take the point at the trial, this Court should, for the reasons I have indicated, grant leave for the ground now taken to be relied upon. What happened amounted to a serious irregularity and I consider that Ground 3 has been established. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 4: A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by reason of the failure of the learned trial judge to limit, pursuant to s 136 of the Evidence Act 1995, use to which the jury could put the evidence of complaint given by [TS] 
        
       
      
    41   The direction which the trial judge gave to the jury was in these terms (SU 26-27): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “There is also another direction I should give you about the conversation between [the complainant] and [TS]… This direction relates to what is called evidence of complaint and [the complainant] has said that she made a complaint of sexual interference to [TS]. What do you make of that evidence? You know, what value does it have in your deliberations? 
         
        
        
         
         Again, if you are satisfied, and I stress, if you are satisfied that [the complainant] did in fact say to [TS] the words that [the complainant] says at the time that [the complainant] said she said them, then you are entitled to use that evidence also as some evidence of the guilt of Mr Kennedy. If you are satisfied that she made a complaint as she said she did, and [TS] says she doesn’t remember anything, but if you are not satisfied that it was actually made at the time then you cannot use that evidence against Mr Kennedy… 
         
        
        
         
         If you are satisfied [the complainant] told [TS] in the way she says she did, and frankly I think that is a little bit hard because there is a conflict, and the Crown acknowledges that by making the time frame extended, but if you are satisfied that that was made then you are entitled also to use that as evidence of the Crown case against Mr Kennedy.” 
         
        
       
      
    42   I adverted earlier when considering Grounds 1 and 2 to the difficulty that the amendment of Count 1 created in determining whether any complaint made was then recent. It is further submitted here that the judge should have directed under s 136 of the Evidence Act that the evidence of complaint be given a limited effect, restricting its use by the jury to considering its consistency with the complainant’s conduct. The complaint is thus that the above direction was too broad. Reference was made to Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 where the potential application of the section to evidence of complaint was considered. 
     
      
       
      
    43   The appellant complains that the absence of a limiting direction was compounded by the absence of any warning under s 165 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
       
      
    44   At the trial counsel for the appellant sought neither a direction under s 136 nor a warning under s 165. Rule 4 therefore applies. I have concluded for other reasons that these convictions ought to be quashed but if this ground was to be considered in isolation I would not have been disposed to grant leave to rely upon it. The judge drew the jury’s attention to the conflict between the complainant and TS and the problem that this presented for the jury in making any use of the complaint evidence. If there was no other difficulty with this trial, it would not seem to me that the direction that his Honour gave would have involved any risk of a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 5: A miscarriage of justice occurred by reason of his Honour’s directions as to the matter being a “competition” between the complainant and the appellant 
        
       
      
    45   In the course of his summing up his Honour referred to the competing evidence of the complainant and the appellant concerning each of the offences charged. His Honour went on to say (SU 14): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “So you could say ‘well there is competition, a conflict between the two’. As long as you keep in mind, you can say that, you can say indeed to yourself ‘do I believe this, do I believe that’, you are entitled to do that. You are entitled to do that. That can produce this sort of result. ‘I am satisfied Mr Kennedy has told me the truth’, end of case, verdicts not guilty. If you do not say that - and that is not necessarily the first question but if you do say that - the question that you put after that is ‘If I accept Mr Kennedy, am I satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that [the complainant’s] told me the truth’, is a conclusion that cannot be, so end of case. All right, next question, ‘I believe [the complainant]. I do not believe Mr Kennedy, I believe [the complainant]’. That is not the end of it because the test is beyond reasonable doubt. The Crown may have proved the charge but it has got to be proved beyond reasonable doubt so you have to believe [the complainant] beyond reasonable doubt. Keep that as your last question, you do not go wrong.” 
         
        
       
      
    46   Complaint is made that this direction was erroneous because it may have distracted the jury and may have led them to believe that it was appropriate to analyse the case by asking whether they believed the appellant. The danger, it was submitted, was that this might mislead the jury as to the onus of proof. 
     
      
       
      
    47   When one looks at the above passage of the summing up as a whole, I do not perceive there to have been a risk that the jury would have been led astray in the manner for which the appellant here contends. Whilst I consider it is unfortunate that the jury was directed that it was appropriate to start by considering whether it believed the appellant, viewed as a whole it seems to me that the jury was adequately instructed that it was for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the appellant and that this in turn involved proving beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was telling the truth. 
     
      
       
      
    48   Moreover, earlier in the summing up (at pp 6-7), the jury had been given these further directions in point: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Now, it is important that you understand [the accused] does not have to convince you of anything. You are entitled to look at his evidence because it is part of the whole of the evidence, all the material that there is in the trial, but he does not have to convince you of anything. The Crown has the task to convince you essentially that [the complainant’s] told you the truth and the whole truth and nothing but the truth, that is really what the trial is about and that you are satisfied on that point beyond reasonable doubt, so I want to get that point clear in your minds. I am sure the Crown had not meant to suggest that Mr Kennedy had to prove his innocence or had to prove that he did not do anything wrong by that comment but in case it is reacted with you in the thinking ‘well you know, has Mr Kennedy satisfied me that he didn’t do it?’, that is totally wrong. The shoe is on the other foot as it were. The Crown has to prove the case as the Crown brings the case. 
         
        
        
         
         Well now I have told you that is the first principle, is the presumption of innocence. The second one is the burden of proof and I have said it to you, that the Crown has to prove the guilt of the accused. 
         
        
        
         
         Now the trial is not conducted as if it is a competition, like a sporting event such as a race or a tug-of-war where you have got opposing sides and one side has to draw the other side across the winning line or one side has to run across the winning line. Sometimes it may appear to you in the trial that it is very much like that, you have got competing sides. One putting forward something, one challenging it, the other one putting forward something, it being challenged and so it is backwards and forwards, it is a competition between these two people. That is quite all right for the trial to proceed on that basis in that manner as the case is tested but the end of the process is not which side has convinced you, the question is only has the Crown satisfied you, convinced you beyond reasonable doubt. I used the word ‘convince’, but the words that are written large in the law are ‘satisfied beyond reasonable doubt’ and that is the final question that you put yourselves when you have thought about the evidence and you have thought about the arguments. You put to yourselves the question ‘Am I satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that [the complainant’s] told me the truth and that the legal elements (which I will come to) have all been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in my mind’.” 
         
        
       
      
    49   In my view the above directions made it clear to the jury where the onus lay, that the appellant did not have to prove anything and that ultimately proof of the Crown case depended upon satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant had told the truth. 
     
      
       
      
    50   This grounds fails. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 6: His Honour erred in his directions as to lies and consciousness of guilt  
        
       
      
    51   The directions which the jury was given concerning lies appears at pp 25-26 of the summing up. His Honour referred to the record of interview and said of it: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “…I must give you a legal direction now about the record of interview that Mr Kennedy participated in with the police. There is no doubt that it, it is lies, he has accepted that it is lies.” 
         
        
       
      
    52   Nowhere in the direction which followed did his Honour identify those lies to which he was referring (SU 26): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Well now in terms of the evidence of a lie your initial reaction might be ‘oh you know he’s got something wrong’ but the law says people lie for lots of reasons. They can lie because they are nervous. They can lie to protect other people. They can lie because they do not want to commit themselves to anything at the time and that you should be aware that people lie for various reasons. If you are satisfied that this is a deliberate lie told by Mr Kennedy because if he told the truth in the record of interview then it would have revealed his wrongdoing in relation to the matters that have brought him before the Court - the word that the law uses is consciousness of guilt. He is hiding his guilt about these matters - if you are satisfied that that is the case then you are entitled to use his lie as evidence in his guilt, but unless you are satisfied that he told a deliberate lie to cover up the truth because it would involve him in this wrongdoing you cannot use that lie against him. And as Mr Shaw has pointed to you in the evidence, Mr Kennedy said he lied because he wanted to find out what was going on. Look at the time frame Mr Shaw said, 1989, 1992, birth of child, interviewed 1994. So there was a time period of a couple of years, at least after the birth of the child.” 
         
        
       
      
    53   The complaint is made that these directions invited the jury to consider that the whole of the appellant’s answers in the record of interview could be treated as lies and, indeed, the direction was so broad as to encompass the appellant’s denial of the 1981 offence. Question 60 prompted a denial: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “60.Q. Right. I am now going to ask you some questions about an allegation that, about the 27th July 1981 at Albury in New South Wales, you had sexual intercourse with [the complainant] by placing your penis in her vagina. Before I do, I want you to understand you are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but whatever you say will be recorded and may be used in evidence. Do you understand that? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yeah. No. Never.” 
         
        
       
      
    54   There followed questioning in closer detail at questions 98-101 on the complainant’s version of that first sexual offence: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “98. Q. All right. It is further alleged that on that particular evening you took [the complainant] into Robert Kennedy’s room. What can you tell me about that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. Nothing. 
         
        
        
         
         99. Q. All right. It is further alleged that, after taking [the complainant] into Robert Kennedy’s room, you removed [the complainant’s] pants. 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. No. 
         
        
        
         
         100.Q And it is further alleged that you then placed your penis in [the complainant’s] vagina. 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. No, I don’t remember anything like that, no. 
         
        
        
         
         101.Q. And it is further alleged that you then said ‘Go straight to the toilet’. What can you tell me about that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. That’s all, all lies, that.” 
         
        
       
      
    55   Then a more general question and answer followed: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “103.Q Did you have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] on any occasion whilst you were living in Albury, New South Wales? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. No, she was only a little girl.” 
         
        
       
      
    56   Rule 4 applies to this ground because no objection was taken to the directions given to the jury about lies. 
     
      
       
      
    57   The Crown submitted that it would have been obvious to the jury that the reference to lies in the interview was a reference to the appellant telling the jury that he had never had sexual intercourse with the complainant. In his evidence at the trial the appellant admitted that he had had intercourse with her more than 100 times in a period of five years and that the complainant had three children by him. So it is, the Crown argued, that it would have been obvious to the jury that his Honour was not referring to anything that the appellant told the police concerning events prior to the admitted period of sexual relationship which began in about June 1986. Unfortunately, the jury was not told this, and plainly the jury should have been assisted by being informed precisely what it was to which the directions related. It seems to me that absent more precise definition of the “lies” the subject of the directions given, it was open to the jury to wander into inappropriate areas of the record of interview and to consider inappropriately responses to be found there as evidence of the appellant’s guilt. 
     
      
       
      
    58   Leave to rely upon this ground should be granted and, in my opinion, the ground has been established. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 7: A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the failure of his Honour to direct the jury as to the manner in which the delay in the making of the complaint and the prosecution of the alleged offences impacted upon the appellant’s defence 
        
       
      
    59   The delay between the alleged commission of these offences and in particular the offence the subject of the first count, was very significant. The complainant did not approach the police until 1991 and the interview which prompted the directions to the jury as to lies did not occur until 1994. The trial took place six years after that. The appellant was criticised by the Crown for his lack of detailed recollection as compared with that of the complainant. In the course of submissions today, the learned Crown Prosecutor has properly drawn the attention of this Court to passages of cross examination of the appellant where he was cross examined at the trial about his lack of recall. 
     
      
       
      
    60   In the summing up (at 16), the jury was reminded of a Crown submission that by way of contrast with the complainant’s detailed evidence the appellant’s answers were “very general”, “you cannot tie him down”. The Crown case on the first count gave rise to issues not only as to the time of the telecast but as to who was present at it. There was the issue as to whether there had been a contemporaneous complaint made, and there was the further matter as to what was the nature of the relationship between the appellant and the complainant that preceded the period in which sexual intercourse admittedly took place in 1986 and later, and in particular in the period when the complainant was a twelve year old school girl. 
     
      
       
      
    61   The delay of thirteen years prior to the police interview and the delay of nineteen years prior to the trial must have impacted upon the appellant’s capacity to give a comprehensive account to the police in 1994 and to refute the Crown case at trial. 
     
      
       
      
    62   The jury was given no instruction as to the possible significance of delay in this case; it was not alerted to the disadvantages which the appellant faced as a consequence of the lapse of time. It seems to me that the circumstances gave rise to a need to give the jury a suitable warning. 
     
      
       
      
    63   In R v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362 at 375 Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “(i) Whenever it appears to a trial judge that delay, whether occasioned by delay in reporting a crime or otherwise, may have affected the fairness of a trial, he or she should make such comments and give such warnings as will ensure that the trial is fair. 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) A comment or warning is required if it appears to the trial judge that a jury may not, from its own experience, fully appreciate the effects of delay on the ability of the accused to defend himself or herself whether by testing prosecution evidence or adducing evidence in his own case, to establish a reasonable doubt about his or her guilt. 
         
        
        
         
         (iii) The need for, and content of, any comment will depend on the circumstances of the case. 
         
        
        
         
         (iv) Whether or not there is a need for any, and if so what, warning will also depend on the circumstances of the case. 
         
        
        
         
         (v) Where it appears from the course of evidence, including cross-examination, or the conduct of the trial, including submissions, that specific difficulties were encountered by the accused in testing the evidence of the prosecution or adducing evidence in defence, then those specific difficulties should be highlighted in the summing-up in such a way as makes it clear that delay, for which the accused had not been responsible, had created those difficulties. 
         
        
        
         
         (vi) Where the summing-up identifies difficulties pursuant to (v), the trial judge should indicate to the jury how they should approach their task of determining whether the prosecution has proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. There is no universally applicable formula but some reference to the additional care or caution with which they should approach the prosecution evidence is usually appropriate. 
         
        
        
         
         (vii) In some cases a warning which uses terminology such as ‘dangerous’ or ‘unsafe’ to convict will be required. The reasons for the warning must be explained, generally by relating the danger to the specific difficulties of the character referred to in (v).” 
         
        
       
      
    64   The jury in the present case should have been given a warning in accordance with the second of the propositions set out above. 
     
      
       
      
    65   This is another ground of appeal to which r 4 applies because there was no application made for a suitable direction. There can have been no conceivable advantage for the appellant to decide not to apply for a suitable direction. The absence of any warning as to the danger of convicting after such delay, particularly in relation to the first count, resulted in the jury considering these charges without the benefit of instruction to which the appellant was entitled. In my opinion, the appellant should have leave to rely upon this ground and the ground has been established. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 8: A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the failure of his Honour to direct the jury as to the appellant’s case 
        
       
      
    66   This ground was abandoned. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 9: A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by reason of the incompetence of the appellant’s counsel 
        
       
      
    67   What the appellant relies upon in relation to this ground is elsewhere addressed in other grounds of appeal. The matters referred to have been identified as the failure to oppose the amendment of the indictment, the failure to object to the Crown putting a case to the jury not based on evidence, the failure to seek a direction limiting the use to which complaint evidence could be put, the failure to seek proper directions as to the elements of the offences, the failure to seek proper directions as to lies and the failure to seek proper directions as to the effect of delay. 
     
      
       
      
    68   Since these complaints are elsewhere addressed it does not become necessary to deal with Ground 9 as a discrete ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 10: The convictions constitute miscarriages of justice in that the jury ought to have experienced a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant with respect to the offences charged as Counts 1 and 3 
        
       
      
    69   Although I consider the conviction must be disturbed for reasons already expressed, it remains appropriate to consider Ground 10 because if this ground is established the appellant would be entitled not merely to a new trial but to an acquittal. 
     
      
       
      
    70   The complainant’s evidence formed the basis of the Crown case. That case depended entirely upon the jury’s acceptance of the reliability of her evidence. The fact that there was no complaint to any person in authority for approximately ten years after the time of the alleged commission of the earlier offence is a circumstance which alone requires that the complainant’s evidence be closely scrutinised: see Jones v The Queen 191 CLR 417 at 453. The complainant’s evidence cannot be reconciled with the evidence of her mother in critical respects that bear upon the commission of these offences, particularly the earlier one. The complainant’s evidence of complaint to her school friend did not receive support from that witness where support would have been expected. So far as the second offence is concerned, the issue of consent was critical and the complainant’s mother gave evidence which, if believed, proves an act of consenting intercourse which she observed between the appellant and the complainant close to the time that the offence charged was committed. Indeed, the mother’s evidence, if believed, established the development of a close relationship between the complainant and the appellant by the time the complainant was seventeen. 
     
      
       
      
    71   The appellant gave sworn evidence denying the act of intercourse first charged and asserting that the second act was consensual. 
     
      
       
      
    72   There was the unusual circumstance that the complainant had three children by the appellant but said that she never had consensual intercourse with him. Yet she continued to live in the same house with him. 
     
      
       
      
    73   This ground of appeal requires attention to all the evidence which was placed before the jury including those features which I have identified. Doubtless all those features of the case which required the complainant’s evidence to be so closely scrutinised were considered by the jury. The jury was instructed in the summing up to subject the complainant’s evidence to close scrutiny (SU 18). This Court must, of course, recognise the position of advantage of the jury in seeing and assessing the witnesses as they gave their evidence. Recognising that advantage, not here shared, I am not persuaded that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant on either the first or the third count. It was open to the jury to accept the complainant as a reliable witness. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 11: That the jury was misdirected as to the elements of the offences charged 
        
       
      
    74   This ground was not expressed in the notice of grounds of appeal filed but the Crown does not object to leave being granted to add this ground and such leave should be granted. 
     
      
       
      
    75   The directions which the learned trial judge gave to the jury on the elements of the offences charged in the first and the third counts were as follows (SU 9): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Now the legal elements in the first and third counts - but remember they are separate and that the first has an alternative - involve, if you can think of it three things, the act, focus on the woman, focus on the man. 
         
        
        
         
         The act is sexual intercourse. The law says that the entrance or the penetration by the penis into a vagina is sexual intercourse. There has to be some degree of penetration. You do not have to be satisfied by how much, as long as there is some. You do not have to be satisfied whether the penis is erect or not. You do not have to be satisfied that there is a climax or not. You do not have to be satisfied that the man is enjoying it or not. It is the basic act, the penis penetrating the vagina. Now that applies indeed to all three of the charges, the act.” 
         
        
       
      
    76   His Honour then went on to remind the jury that the appellant denied the act of intercourse charged in the first count. His Honour then proceeded (SU 10): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The second aspect is the focus on the woman. She was not consenting. [The complainant] has told you after a history of physical abuse, in effect her will was overborne by Mr Kennedy and that if he required something of her against her will she gave it to him. She did not stand in opposition to him but she was not consenting. 
         
        
        
         
         Now if it stopped there it would be very unfair because the man would not know whether the woman’s consenting or not and the mere fact that a woman says that she was not consenting would be the end of the matter so the law now focuses upon the man. 
         
        
        
         
         Now in some circumstances it is glaringly obvious on the woman’s version, that she is not consenting. Indeed in the first charge here [the complainant] says she was screaming out. She was indicating she was not consenting.” 
         
        
       
      
    77   His Honour then went on to remind the jury (SU 11): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “All right, how does the Crown indicate in the evidence that the man Mr Kennedy knew that [the complainant] was not consenting. Well there is the direct evidence that she was making her protest audible by screaming, that she was in that way rejecting the advance by Mr Kennedy. 
         
        
        
         
         Now the law goes a little further than directly seeing the woman objecting to the event and says that if a man in fact does not care whether the woman is consenting or not but he has his way with her, to use the old words, he is reckless. Reckless meaning that he does not care but he goes ahead and does it anyway. 
         
        
        
         
         So the Crown says in the first charge, even if you are not satisfied that Mr Kennedy directly appreciated from [the complainant] her opposition he went ahead in circumstances where he did not care whether she was consenting or not and he had sex with her.” 
         
        
       
      
    78   His Honour then went on to give directions about the third count (SU 13): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Count number 3, same set of ingredients, act, focus on woman, state of mind, not consenting. Focus on man, state of mind, he believed, well he knew that she was not consenting. 
         
        
        
         
         Here the defence is it was a consensual act. She was consenting,  
         Mr Kennedy believed she was consenting and that the circumstances were such that he was, in effect, entitled to believe that 
         . When you look at it there was not something that was occurring that would indicate to him that he was acting recklessly, that he was going to have sex whether she wanted it or not, so they are really different scenarios as it were, even though the sexual intercourse incident runs between all of them, but you do have to approach them on a different basis. First one you are determining did the act occur. The third one you do not have to determine did the act occur because it is agreed that it occurred 
         . What you have got to concern yourself with on the third one, standing as I remind you, as a separate trial as it were, is was there consent, or has the Crown proved that there was no consent and has the Crown proved that Mr Kennedy knew that [the complainant] was not consenting 
         . 
         
        
        
         
         So basically the first charge is are you satisfied the act occurred. The third charge is  
         are you satisfied there was no consent and that Mr Kennedy knew that no consent 
         . That is it to contrast number 1 and number 3 because they are basically, not basically, they are the same set of legal ingredients.” 
         
        
        
         
         (Emphasis added) 
         
        
       
      
    79   The complaint is made that the trial judge failed to direct the jury that if the jury considered it to be a reasonable possibility that the appellant believed the complainant was consenting he should be acquitted. In instructing the jury in the words “Mr Kennedy believed she was consenting and that the circumstances were such that he was in effect entitled to believe that” introduced an objective test and that the jury should have been instructed that the test was a subjective one. 
     
      
       
      
    80   In R v Hemsley (1988) 36 A Crim R 334 the Court of Criminal Appeal considered the following directions of the trial judge to be correct (set out at 336): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “You should remember we are considering the situation where the girl in fact did not consent. In such a situation the man's state of mind at the time of the act of intercourse might be that he actually knew that she was not consenting. That is a guilty state of mind and if the evidence satisfies you that that was the state of mind of the accused at the time of the act of intercourse then the third element of the charge has been made out.  
         
        
        
         
         On the other hand, the man's state of mind might be that he honestly, though wrongly, believed the girl was consenting to intercourse. That is not a guilty state of mind. It is for the Crown to prove that the accused had a guilty mind and so if as to either charge the Crown has failed to prove that at the time of intercourse the accused did not honestly believe that the girl was consenting, then in respect of that charge you would have to say that this third element of the defence is not made out and return in respect of that charge a verdict of not guilty.  
         
        
        
         
         Between those two situations, on the one hand, the knowledge that the girl did not consent, and on the other hand, an honest though mistaken belief that she does, there lies the third possible situation where the man does not actually know either way, but is reckless as to whether the girl is consenting or not. That is to say, his state of mind is such that he realises the possibility that she is not consenting, but chooses to proceed to have intercourse notwithstanding. The law says that is a guilty state of mind. The law says that a man who is reckless as to whether the woman consents or not is deemed to know she is not consenting. That is to say, he is to be treated as if he knows in fact that she does not consent."" 
         
        
       
      
    81   Later, in R v Newham (unreported, NSWCCA, 26 November 1993) Clarke JA, having referred to the direction in Hemsley said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""The importance of the passage I quoted is that it directs attention wholly and solely to the subjective state of mind of the accused person. The court is not concerned with an objective test, but whether on the facts proved the accused person had the requisite knowledge or, alternatively, acted recklessly in the way there described."" 
         
        
       
      
    82   It is plain from a consideration of the above authorities that on the issue of knowledge, it is the subjective state of mind of the accused person which is to be considered. See also O’Meagher (unreported, NSWCCA, 10 February 1997). I now return to the direction in the present case which has attracted this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    83   Referring to the first of the passages emphasised in the extract from the summing up, it was submitted that this introduced an objective test contrary to the authorities reviewed. 
     
      
       
      
    84   It was submitted that this was a significant error because the complainant had given evidence that she made no physical movements to resist as she was scared and the complainant said only that her mother and her brother would be home soon. Since their verdict indicates that the jury must have believed the complainant was not consenting, the appellant’s belief or the lack of it assumed critical significance. 
     
      
       
      
    85   The Crown has submitted that the first of the passages emphasised in the direction under consideration was not a direction of law at all but a review of the way the appellant put his case. The directions of law are to be found, the Crown submits, in the second and the third of the passages emphasised. Here the jury was told that the Crown had to prove lack of consent and knowledge in the appellant that there was lack of consent and this involved no misdirection. 
     
      
       
      
    86   It seems to me that the Crown’s analysis of the first of the emphasised passages is correct. This being so, the charge to the jury only addressed two of the three situations considered in Hemsley. The jury should also have been directed as to recklessness as the jury was charged in Hemsley. However, the lack of any direction about this third consideration did not operate against the appellant. As charged, the jury had to be satisfied, absent consent, that the appellant knew the complainant was not consenting. The appellant lost no chance of acquittal on the third count because the jury was not told that if he realised the possibility that the complainant was not consenting but chose to proceed to have intercourse notwithstanding, this constituted recklessness. 
     
      
       
      
    87   In my opinion Ground 11 has not been established. 
     
      
       
        
       Proposed orders 
        
       
      
    88   I would propose that this appeal be allowed, for the reasons stated, and that the convictions and the sentences of the appellant on both the first and the third counts be quashed. 
     
      
       
      
    89   The question arises as to whether a new trial should be ordered. In Walton (supra) one of the features which influenced the court not to order a new trial was that the first trial had miscarried because of the Crown Prosecutor’s conduct at trial. One of the reasons for this trial having miscarried is the conduct of the Crown Prosecutor. 
     
      
       
      
    90   Another matter of significance, as I see it, is that this is now a very old case. There has been a lengthy delay between the alleged commission of the offences and the time of the first trial. There would be further delay if the appellant was required to stand trial again. 
     
      
       
      
    91   It does not seem to me, for the reasons I have indicated, that it would be appropriate for there to be a new trial on the indictment as amended in any event. 
     
      
       
      
    92   I have concluded that in all the circumstances of this case, a new trial ought not to be ordered and that verdicts and judgments of acquittal should be entered. 
     
      
       
      
    93   I would therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
       1. That the appeal be allowed; 
        
        
       2. That the convictions and the sentences be quashed; 
        
        
       3. That verdicts and judgments of acquittal be entered. 
        
       
      
    94   HEYDON JA: I wish to make favourable reference to the responsible and honourable approach of counsel, who appeared for the Crown on appeal, to the issues in this appeal. He did not appear at trial. Apart from that, I agree with Studdert J. 
     
      
       
      
    95   GREG JAMES J: I agree with the orders proposed by Studdert J and his reasons therefor. I specifically wish to associate myself with the remarks made by the presiding judge. 
     
      
       
      
    96   HEYDON JA: Accordingly, the Court will make the orders proposed by Studdert J.

     Regina v Joe Michael CARBONE 
      
    The appellant was convicted of two counts of indecent assault, and one count of aggravated sexual intercourse. The first two counts related to acts committed on 3 December 1996, the further count related to acts committed on 7 August 1997. The jury convicted the appellant upon the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant in relation to some but not all counts in the indictment. He appealed against the conviction on the grounds that the verdicts were unreasonable or incapable of being supported having regard to the evidence. HELD (allowing the appeal):1. The Court of Criminal Appeal is not bound to act in accordance with the opinions expressed by a trial judge as to whether or not, upon the evidence, they would have found an accused person guilty. Nevertheless, the Court should give careful consideration to the remarks of the trial judge, particularly where the remarks are from a judge with considerable experience.2. The prosecution case lacked probative force and was tainted by a number of matters of disquiet relating to the prosecution evidence, including the lack of direct corroboration by those witnesses who might be expected to have seen the sexual misconduct alleged.M (1994) 181 CLR 487 applied3. Where a multiple count sexual assault case involves a single complainant and single accused, and the only direct evidence of the commission of the offences is that of the complainant and there is an acquittal on any of those charges, then in the absence of an acceptable explanation, an acquittal on the remaining charges will normally be required. This is because the rejection of the complainant’s evidence damages his or her overall credibility, and cannot be overcome without some circumstance or fact which provides a rational basis for accepting the complainants evidence in regard to the other counts. This may be the case where the evidence is stronger for the count upon which it was accepted, than it was for the count upon which it was rejected. Jones (1997) 191 CLR 439, R v RAT (2000) 111ACrimR 360, Wells NSWCCA 17 June 1998, James [1999] NSWCCA 191, Meala [1999] NSWCCA, R v W (1999) 109 ACrimR 51 applied. 4. There was no logical explanation for the conflicting verdicts, nor was there any identifiable surrounding circumstance which could have strengthened the complainants credibility or the reliability of the evidence in relation to the counts for which guilty verdicts were returned. ORDERS PROPOSED(1) Appeal against conviction allowed(2) Conviction and sentence set aside and verdicts of acquittal substituted

      Regina v Joe Michael CARBONE  
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
     
    1   WOOD CJ at CL: The appellant appeared for trial in the District Court on 9 August 1999, upon 6 counts of sexual assault and one count of common assault. The first four counts related to acts alleged to have been committed on 3 December 1996,and the remaining three counts related to acts alleged to have been committed on 7 August 1997. 
     
      
     3 December 1996 
      
    2   So far as the 3 December matters are concerned the appellant was charged with two acts of indecent assault - touching the complainant KLD on her breast from outside her clothing, and placing his hand up her skirt (counts 1 and 2). These charges were preferred under S 61(M)(1) Crimes Act 1900. He was further charged with having sexual intercourse with KLD without her consent in circumstances of aggravation knowing that she was not consenting (count 3); and, in the alternative, with sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years (count 4). These offences were respectively charged under S 61J and S 66(C)(1) Crimes Act 1900. At the time of the alleged offence KLD was aged 14 years. 
    3   It was the Crown case, based upon the evidence of KLD, that after leaving school this day, she walked to the Griffith Entertainment Centre with two girlfriends, NS and MGK. In the parking area, she saw the appellant and Ross Lentini, sitting on the appellant’s car. KLD said that the appellant made various suggestive comments to her, rubbed himself up and down a pole and against her knee before querying whether the three of them, ie KLD, MGK and the appellant, could have a “gang bang”. KLD said that, at the time of these exchanges, Lentini and NS were sitting in the back of the appellant’s car. 
    4   KLD said that the appellant then walked down the ramp, looked up to where she and MGK were standing, and observed “nice view up your skirt”. MGK, she said, made some comments about her not being a virgin and wanting to sleep with the appellant before walking away into the Entertainment Centre. The appellant according to KLD, then asked her whether she wanted to have sex with him. When she refused he grabbed her from behind and tried to push her to the ground. He then spun her around and pushed her against the rear offside door of his car. He undid his pants, placed his hands up her skirt and pulled her pants down and her skirt up. He then inserted his penis in her vagina, penetrating her four or five times, for less than a minute. (counts 3 and 4) After pulling away from her, according to KLD, he said aloud “You know you wanted me”. This occurred, according to her, while MKG was returning and while the appellant was doing up his pants. 
    5   Prior to this, she said, the appellant had placed his hand up her skirt between her legs, and had touched her breasts on the outside of her shirt. (counts 1 and 2) This, she said, had occurred while they were sitting on the bonnet of the car, while MGK was present. In cross examination KLD varied and expanded on this account to some extent, suggesting that the first touching occurred at the railings, and adding that the appellant had also rubbed his groin up and down her leg, while she was sitting on the bonnet, of the car, with MGK beside her. 
    6   KLD said that, after returning home, she changed and went to the swimming pool with a friend. She made no complaint to her parents that night, or to the friend who accompanied her to the pool. Later she said that, while having a shower, she noticed that she was very sore and bleeding. On the following day, she said that she informed a schoolteacher, Louise Chesworth, that she had been “raped”. 
    7   On 5th December she was examined by Dr. Marion Reeves. There was no finding of abnormality, but as Dr Reeves explained this did not confirm or exclude the occurrence of sexual intercourse. There was one difference of some moment in the history given, so far as KLD informed the doctor that the act of intercourse occurred after she had been pushed to the ground. A routine sexual assault investigation was conducted. No semen was detected on the vaginal swab or smear. 
    8   On 6th December she made a statement to police. On 31 July 1997, she gave evidence at the committal hearing in the Griffith Local Court. She was cross examined by Counsel for the appellant that day.  
    9   MGK gave evidence in relation to the events at the Entertainment Centre. She confirmed the circumstances of the meeting, as well as the identity of those present. There was some conversation between those present, she said, but to her recollection it was “just like a normal conversation. Nothing extraordinary”. She said that, after a time, she walked down the ramp, thereby taking herself away from the immediate area where the appellant and KLD were. She was away for about thirty seconds to one minute. While she was down the ramp she heard KLD say to the appellant, in a laughing tone “You sick bastard”. When she returned she noticed that KLD had a strange look on her face “as if she was a bit angry but not too bothered”. 
    10   Shortly afterwards KLD walked away. MGK followed her. According to her, KLD said “every time I (meaning MGK) turn around Joe’s been touching (me)”. She did not, however, see any sexual assault of any kind occur. In cross examination she agreed that at some stage she heard the appellant ask KLD somewhat firmly to get off the bonnet of his car, because to her impression she was acting immaturely, “like a bit of a tart, at times”. 
    11   NS similarly gave evidence of the three girls walking to the Entertainment Centre, of seeing the appellant and Ross Lentini there, and of getting into the back of the appellant’s car with the latter. She remained there, on her account, for about ten minutes. She did not see or hear anything happening around the car. She said that at one stage, KLD and the appellant disappeared from view. MGK similarly disappeared. When she finally got out of the car, she saw KLD following the appellant up the ramp. KLD, she said, had “tears running down her eyes”. 
    12   Ms Chesworth gave evidence of being approached by KLD on the morning of 4 December. She appeared not to be as happy or bubbly as she normally was. Rather, she seemed to be agitated and disturbed. KLD asked her whether she could keep a secret? She replied that she had a legal responsibility to pass certain things on to the relevant authorities. KLD took the conversation no further at that stage, but made several similar inquiries of her during that day. She eventually suggested that KLD speak to the school counsellor, Mr. Kruger-Davis. When KLD later said that she was not comfortable speaking to him, Ms Chesworth asked her what the problem was? She replied that she had been “raped” two days ago at the Entertainment Centre by the appellant. 
    13   Mr. Kruger-Davis, the school counsellor, confirmed having spoken to KLD, at the request of Ms Chesworth. When he saw her she appeared to be in tears, distressed and agitated. He arranged to meet with her the following morning. 
    14   Ms Rebecca Hall, a friend of KLD, gave evidence of receiving a letter from her in early December in which she stated that she had been “raped” at the Entertainment Centre the preceding day. She ripped up this letter, but on the same day that it was received, KLD repeated the complaint to her on their way home from school. No detail beyond the act of having been “raped” was provided. 
    15   The appellant was interviewed in relation to this matter by Det Senior Constable Casserly, on 3 January 1997. He denied the allegations made against him, although he acknowledged having spoken to KLD at the Entertainment Centre on the relevant day. He said that he had asked her to get off the bonnet of his car because he did not like the way she was carrying on. He was arrested, on 6 February 1997, by Det Senior Constable Blanchard, and charged with the offences that became Counts 1 to 3 in the indictment (the fourth count having been added later as a back-up charge). 
    16   At his trial, he gave evidence that, prior to 3 December 1996, he had not known KLD. He said that when he came out of the Entertainment Centre he saw KLD sitting on the bonnet of his car. At some stage he sat on the bonnet of his car with her and with MKG whom he already knew. He tried to have a conversation with the latter, but, according to him KLD continually butted in. He eventually went back into the Entertainment Centre. He said that by the time he returned KLD had already left. He denied having intercourse with her or indecently touching her. He also denied propositioning her, or engaging in smutty conversation with her, or about her. 
    17   Ross Lentini was not called, either by the Crown or by the appellant. 
    18   The jury returned verdicts of guilty in relation to the two indecent assault charges (counts 1 and 2) but acquitted the appellant on the sexual intercourse counts (counts 3 and 4). 
     
      
     7th August 1997 
      
    19   In relation to this date, the appellant was similarly charged with a count of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent (count 5) and with a back-up count of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years (count 6). The victim in each case was similarly said to be KLD, who was still aged fourteen years at the time. The remaining count (count 7) was one of common assault of a girlfriend of KLD, namely JMOS. 
    20   KLD gave evidence to the effect that, on the night of 7 August 1997, she attended a disco at the Griffith High School. She met some friends outside the disco and went to the ‘weather shed’ where they consumed some scotch whisky and coke. KLD said that she consumed two cups of this mix, which left her feeling ‘tipsy and light headed’. Miss JMOS, however, was significantly affected and was asked to leave the disco because of her inappropriate behaviour. She was removed from the school by police but asked KLD to meet her in fifteen minutes at the ‘tuckshop’. 
    21   KLD subsequently met her at Johnson’s tuckshop, after which they began to walk the 500 metres or so back to the school. She said that they heard someone behind them. She turned around and saw the appellant and another man who she did not know. The two men caught up with them at the gate to the primary school. There she said the appellant pushed JMOS to the ground. (count 7). 
    22   The other male, she said, held her around the waist. The appellant said to her “You got raped the first time bitch, I’ll show you what rape really is”.  
    23   JMOS she said went towards the High School for help. While she was away, KLD said, the unidentified man pushed her to the ground onto her back and pinned her hands above her head. The appellant she said, undid his trousers, pulled her pants down and said “Remember if you go to court where your undies are; they’re below your knees and above your ankles”. This she understood to be a reference to her confusion when giving evidence at the committal, a week earlier. The appellant having spoken these words, placed himself on top of her and inserted his penis in her vagina for “less than a minute”. When he withdrew, she felt sore and wet. 
    24   According to her version of events, the appellant stood up and redressed himself. He then walked over to the other man and said “go on, its your turn”. That man was somewhat hesitant, but at the appellant’s urging, he also had intercourse with her. After doing so the appellant told him to hold KLD down again. The appellant again penetrated her in a way that was rougher and more painful. Her back she said was scratched against the cement on which she was lying. KLD said that these events occurred over the three or four minutes while JMOS was away. 
    25   As the appellant pulled his pants up, KLD heard JMOS call her from about 5 metres away. The two men ran off, leaving her on the ground with her pants still down. Her clothing, she said, was wet and she had mud on her pants and on the back of her shirt. 
    26   KLD and JMOS then walked back together to the disco where they remained until it finished. No complaint was made to any teacher or to any friend that night. Two friends, however, questioned her as to what was wrong and took her to the toilets for a drink of water. One of them took her to Ms Carrodus, a teacher. Although she also asked what was wrong, no complaint was made by KLD that night either to Miss Carrodus, or to her mother, who picked her up from the disco. 
    27   The first occasion on which any details were provided of these alleged further events was in a statement made to police, on 22 August 1997, which was expanded in a later statement, made on 4 May 1998. In the first statement, there was no mention of the second male having had intercourse with her, nor was there any mention of the appellant having intercourse with her for a second time, ie following the other man. 
    28   KLD did not see a doctor after these events, but she was referred to a community nurse for pregnancy and chlamydia tests, three or four days later.  
    29   Rebecca Hall gave evidence of attending the school disco and of seeing JMOS being removed because of her drunkenness. JMOS, she said, was falling over everything and could not walk properly, when she saw her. Later that night she saw KLD in a distressed state. She appeared to have been crying, her back and arms had wet patches and her shirt was untucked. No complaint of having been sexually assaulted was however made to her. Later in the night KLD seemed to have settled down and was observed to be dancing. After leaving the disco she noted that there were wet patches and mud on the back of KLD’s trousers. 
    30   The complainant’s mother gave evidence of driving her daughter and several other girls to the disco, and of picking up KLD and Ms Hall at about 10pm. She said that, at that stage, KLD was dishevelled, her clothes were damp and she looked as if she had been crying and avoiding eye contact with her. She assumed that the girls had been drinking. When she later asked KLD “what was going on?” she received the reply “nothing”. Three unusual incidents stood out in her mind - namely that KLD sat in the back of the car on the way home; that on the following morning she got up early and placed her clothes in the washing machine; and that she found the buttons of the shirt which KLD had been wearing that night to have become loose. 
    31   Ms Carrodus, a teacher at the school, gave evidence of having been rostered to supervise the disco. At about 7.40pm. she was approached by KLD who appeared to be hysterical and upset about a friend of hers, who she thought was going to be in trouble. She noticed that KLD had wet hair and clothing. After speaking to her she went outside with another teacher to look for JMOS. Although she did not find JMOS she learned that someone else had taken her back to the foyer. She then waited with JMOS for some time before she was removed by the police. JMOS, she said, was wet and drunk, and made several attempts to leave the foyer and to go back into the hall where the disco was. She had to be restrained. 
    32   At about 8.45pm Rebecca Hall informed her that KLD wished to speak to her. She appeared even wetter than before, and her clothing was muddy. She was obviously upset and rambled about what had occurred that night in relation to JMOS. Ms Carrodus said that she gave her short thrift because it had been a trying night and KLD was rambling. 
    33   JMOS confirmed attending the disco even though, at the time, she was subject to suspension from the school. She was joined by several friends in the ‘weather shed’ where she and KLD consumed some Scotch whisky. She confirmed that at this time she was “quite drunk … not walking properly, and was very giggly and out of control”. She fell over a number of times. KLD, she said, was also intoxicated. After she was taken home by police she walked back to the school, meeting KLD on the way, at Johnson’s tuckshop. KLD was, at that point, already crying. As the night went on, she said that she “got better”, presumably as the effects of alcohol wore off. 
    34   They each noticed the appellant and another man following them. She said that when these men caught up with them, one of them, who she “believed” was the appellant, pushed her onto the ground where she fell half into the mud and half onto the concrete. KLD she said was dragged into the school. 
    35   She saw that the other man had hold of KLD around the waist. KLD was yelling and struggling and being pulled further into the school grounds. She said that she would go and get help. She made her way towards the disco but turned back when she heard KLD swearing and yelling. She also said that she did not get very far because her ankle had twisted when she was pushed over, and was sore.  
    36   When she got back she saw KLD lying on the ground with the appellant standing at her feet, and the other man sitting or kneeling behind her head. KLD’s pants were down past her knees and she was crying. The appellant pulled up his pants and the two men ran off. She and KLD returned to the disco and then parted company. There was, on her account, no discussion at this point as to what had occurred or as to what action they should take. She said that apart from the twisted ankle, she had a bruise on her leg and sore elbows. 
    37   JMOS agreed that she did not tell her parents, or any person in authority, what had happened to her or to KLD, until she gave her statement to police on 25 August 1997, at their request. 
    38   Melissa Stapleton and Nicole Murray each gave evidence of seeing KLD at the disco, at a time (about 9.30pm) when she appeared to be upset, and to have wet hair and clothes. They took her to the toilets to give her a drink of water. KLD said that she wanted to see Ms Carrodus, the disco supervisor. There was no specific mention to either of them as to what was troubling her. Nicole Murray said that KLD was unable to talk straight, and she noticed that her speech was “kind of slurred”. 
    39   On 28 August 1997 Detective Blanchard endeavoured to speak to the appellant in relation to this further series of allegations. When informed of the additional complaints he said “What, the first time behind the Entertainment Centre, and now at the primary school. I’m going to take this all the way, whatever it takes, I know what I’ve done and what I haven’t”. The appellant, after seeing his solicitor, refused to be interviewed. He was then charged with the offences that comprise the remaining counts in the indictment. 
    40   Inquiries by police failed to identify the second man alleged to have been involved in these events. Neither KLD or JMOS were able to identify anyone from an array of photographs shown to them, that included one possible suspect, named by JMOS who consented to his photograph being included in the display. 
    41   In giving evidence in relation to this night, the appellant denied having been present in the vicinity of the school. He could not, however, recall where he had been. He denied having sexual intercourse with the appellant or having pushed JMOS. He said that he had never seen the latter girl before sighting her outside the court during the week of the trial.  
    42   The jury acquitted the appellant of the common assault charge (count 7) but found him guilty of the offence of aggravated sexual assault. (count 5) 
     
      
     The Remarks of the Trial Judge 
      
    43   The seven counts were tried together because the complainant’s evidence was suggestive of the second night’s events having been incited by the fact of her earlier complaint, and of having been a form of revenge attack; and also by reference to the cross examination at committal where she had been challenged as to the position of her underpants when subjected to intercourse on the first occasion. 
    44   When sentencing the appellant, the learned trial judge (Shillington DCJ) expressed considerable disquiet at the outcome, observing that he had “profound misgivings” about the verdicts that had been returned. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
       “First of all, I remark that I found the evidence of the complainant and the principal prosecution witness, Janice O’Shea, to be unimpressive. I also heard evidence from the prisoner and in that case my impression which I think is confirmed by the pre-sentence report which is before me, of him was that he is a straightforward uncomplicated young man and he struck me as an honest witness. I note he has no previous convictions. 
       
      
      
       
       If I had the power I would have dismissed all charges on the basis that the Crown’s evidence was in my view unsafe and unsatisfactory. I do not have that power, but clearly, in my view, it is incumbent upon me to express the views I have been being the presiding Judge and having the opportunity of seeing the witnesses during the trial. 
       
      
      
       
       Without detailing all my reasons I point to some matters which were of, in my view, significance. With regard to the events on 3 December I make the following comments. As I have already said the allegation is that this series of incidents occurred at the back of the amusement parlour in a car parking area which was open to the public. It was the evidence of [MKG], who was present, that she was in the area basically for the whole period but did go down a ramp at one stage. 
       
      
      
       
       The complainant’s evidence is that this girl (MGK) went into the amusement parlour and was away for some time and it was during that time that these events occurred, that is, two incidents of assault with acts of indecency, touching on the groin and touching on the breast and at a later stage an act of sexual intercourse committed by the prisoner upon the complainant. 
       
      
      
       
       It is to be noted that Ms (NS) who was in a car immediately adjacent to the area which the complainant said this latter incident occurred gave no evidence of anything of that type occurring. It is of significance, of course, that in respect to that later charge of sexual intercourse without consent that the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. 
       
      
      
       
       With regard to the incidents on 7 August, although the complainant’s evidence was of a series of serious sexual offences occurring no complaint was made of them until 22 August. 
       
      
      
       
       The evidence is in the crown’s case that the complainant went back to the disco very shortly afterwards. She made no complaint to any friend or more significantly to any teacher at the scene. She did have a discussion with one of the teachers, Ms Carodus, but she spoke about other things and the impression one had from that witness was to use the witness’s words “She gave her short thrift” and I am quoting from page 227 of the stranscript. 
       
      
      
       
       Clearly, in my view, the evidence of Ms O’Shea was not accepted by the jury as a corroborative witness to the incidents of 7 August, in view of the not guilty verdicts to count 7. She said that she left immediately after an approach by the prisoner and another unidentified person to go and get help at the disco which was a short distance away. She said that when she heard the complainant calling out, she then went back. When she returned she saw nothing more than the men there were adjusting their clothing. It was the allegation of the complainant that three acts of sexual intercourse occurred during this very short period. The two young women then apparently returned to the disco, as I have said, nothing of any kind was said by either of them about what allegedly occurred. 
       
      
      
       
       It is also of significance that the complainant, in her statements gave quite different accounts as to what happened, and in particular, the latter statement of 22 August in which she said that there was, in fact, two acts of intercourse by the prisoner and also an act by the other unidentified person. That was not the contents of the original statement. So, as I say without going into all the detail of the matter I was left with a feeling of unease having considered those aspects of the evidence. 
       
      
      
       
       I also remark that the jury’s verdicts in my view are inexplicable when considered in general terms. I make that remark bearing in mind the submissions which have been put to me by the Crown. Although there was no corroboration of the events of 3 December 1996, the jury found the accused guilty on the first and second counts of the indictment but not guilty on the major charge of sexual intercourse without consent and that, of course, comprised the third count in the indictment and the alternative fourth count. That would seem to have cast very substantial doubt upon the acceptance of the evidence of the complainant in light of those verdicts. 
       
      
      
       
       With regard to the events of 7 August 1997, the only corroborative evidence comes from Ms O’Shea to which I have already referred and, in my view, quite clearly her account was not accepted on the basis that the charge of assault upon her resulted in a verdict of not guilty by the jury.” 
       
      
      
       
      
      
     Verdicts unreasonable or incapable of being supported having regard to the evidence. 
      
    45   The basis for the appeal depends upon the appellant bringing himself within S6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The relevant ground is now to be considered in accordance with the decisions in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493; Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 450-451; Gipp v The Queen (1998) 72 ALJR 101; Fleming (1998)158 ALR 379; and Giam (1999) 104 A Crim R 426. 
    46   Reliance is placed upon the proposition that the verdicts were inconsistent; and upon the further proposition that, after making its own independent assessment of the nature and quality of the evidence, and giving due respect to the advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the witnesses, this Court would come to the conclusion that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant in relation to the counts in respect of which guilty verdicts were recorded. 
    47   My assessment of the evidence leads me to precisely the same conclusion as that reached by Shillington DCJ. This Court is not bound to act in accordance with opinions expressed by trial judges as to whether they would or would not have found an accused person guilty, upon the evidence led in the trial, since that would be to risk compromising the system of trial by jury. Nevertheless, the Court should give careful attention to such views, particularly when they are expressed by a trial judge having the depth of experience which his Honour, in the present case, possessed. 
    48   In summary, the matters of disquiet relating to the prosecution evidence, include, so far as the 3 December are concerned, the following matters: 
     
      
     a) the fact that in contrast to KLD, neither MGK or NS observed any conduct that could have constituted a sexual assault or act of indecency, or a sexually provocative comment on the part of the appellant; 
      
      
     b) the suggestion that the assaults occurred within the very brief period of 30 seconds to one minute that MGK walked down the ramp; 
      
      
     c) the proposition that the acts alleged, involving not just acts of indecent touching, but also penile/vaginal intercourse, occurred in a very public place, that was also proximate to the place where KLD’s mother worked; 
      
      
     d) The absence of an immediate complaint to the friends of KLD or to her mother, and of any discussion between them as to her appearance of distress; 
      
      
     e) The fact that the only “complaint” that MGK heard coming from KLD was voiced in a laughing tone; 
      
      
     f) the sworn denial by the appellant whose evidence remained unblemished after cross examination; 
      
      
     g) the absence of any positive corroboration of the prosecution case, other than the appearance of distress, which may also have been attributable to the somewhat greater interest that the appellant appeared to be showing towards MKG, or to his somewhat brusque instruction to KLD to get off his car. 
      
    49   As was pointed out in Gillard NSWCCA 29 October 1976 evidence of distress can constitute support or corroboration, but only in exceptional circumstances and then only subject to a warning as to the limited weight to be attached to it. 
    50   So far as the 7th August counts were concerned, the matters of disquiet, in relation to the prosecution case, concern the following: 
     
      
     a) the fact that each of KLD and JMOS were affected by alcohol, the latter more so than the former; 
      
      
     b) the fact that KLD was seen by several people to be wet, dishevelled and distressed well before the time of the alleged assaults; 
      
      
     c) the absence of any immediate complaint to the friends of KLD who saw her distressed later in the evening, or to her mother or to the teacher to whom she spoke at that time; 
      
      
     d) the fact that, in speaking to the teacher, her concern seemed to have more to do with JMOS’ plight than it did with anything involving herself; 
      
      
     e) the fact that KLD appeared to be happier and to be dancing later in the evening; 
      
      
     f) the significant enlargement of her statement, eight months after first speaking to police, to include a second act of sexual intercourse by the appellant and a similar act by another unidentified man; 
      
      
     g) the circumstance that, if KLD was to be believed, there were three separate acts of penal/vaginal intercourse involving ejaculation, during the very short period of a minute or so while JMOS went for help, none of which acts JMOS saw; 
      
      
     h) the somewhat surprising proposition that a man facing trial for an alleged sexual assault would, within a week or so of committal, repeat such an act in the presence not only of a friend of KLD but also in the presence of an unidentified friend and encourage him to similarly participate in the serious criminality involved. 
      
    51   As was observed by Mason CJ, Deane and Toohey J in M: 
     
      
       
       “Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty (see  
       Whitehorn v The Queen 
        (1983) 152 CLR at 686;  
       Chamberlain v The Queen [No 2] 
        (1984) 153 CLR at 532;  
       Knight v The Queen 
        (1992) 175 CLR 495 at 504-505;511). But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations. ( 
       Chamberlain v The Queen [No 2] 
        (1984) 153 CLR at 621) 
       
      
      
     Later their Honours observed: 
      
      
       
       “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experience by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. ( 
       Chamberlain v The Queen [No 2] 
        (1984) 153 CLR at 618-619;  
       Chidiac v The Queen 
        (1991) 171 CLR 432 at 443-444). 
       
      
    52   Having regard to the matters earlier identified, and leaving aside entirely, for the moment, the different verdicts, the evidence in the prosecution case seems to me to have been significantly tainted or otherwise lacking in probative force. The doubts that I entertain based upon it are of such a kind and exist to such a degree that I am unable to see how they could be explained by any advantage, which the jury may have possessed in seeing and hearing the witnesses who were called. Upon this basis alone I would be minded to allow the appeal. If any residual question remains in that regard, then it is in my view entirely removed by the circumstance of the different verdicts returned in relation to the two sets of alleged events. 
    53   In Jones, the High Court had occasion to consider the impact of the return of a verdict of not guilty in respect to some only of the counts in an indictment, and the return of verdicts of guilty in relation to other counts in the indictment (at 453 to 455). 
    54   There have been a number of appeals in which this decision has been considered, in relation to cases of conflicting verdicts, where the prosecution case depended as it did in the present matter, essentially upon the evidence of the complainant. Some of these appeals were conveniently reviewed in R v RAT [2000] 111 A Crim R 360. They included Wells NSWCCA 17 June 1998; James [1999] NSWCCA 191, Meala [1999] NSWCCA 388, and W (1999) 109 A Crim R 51. 
    55   Dunford J in RAT noted: 
     
      
       
       “…The matter of inconsistent verdicts was recently considered by the High Court in  
       MacKenzie v The Queen 
         
       (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 365 to 368, where the majority (Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ) pointed out that regard must be had to the jury as the ""constitutional"" tribunal for resolving disputed factual questions and the court's reluctance to undermine jury verdicts or to infer from them that the jury, drawn from the community, have done otherwise than their duty. On the other hand where doubt is cast upon a verdict because logically it cannot stand together with another verdict, the appellate court must decide whether the conviction based upon the verdict which is impugned is unsafe and unsatisfactory (or to use the terminology now current whether such verdict cannot be supported and/or is unreasonable, having regard to the evidence:  
       Fleming v The Queen [ 
       1998] HCA 68, 158 ALR 379,  
       R v Giam 
         
       [1999] NSWCCA 53). 
        
        
       22 In dealing with inconsistency alleged to arise from different verdicts on different counts in the same originating process the majority approved the test laid down by Devlin J in  
       R v Stone 
        (unreported - 13 December 1954), followed in  
       R v Hunt 
         
       [1968] 2 QB 433, and went on to say that if there was a proper way by which the verdicts could be reconciled, allowing the conclusion that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted; and if there is some evidence to support the verdict(s) said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury. Their Honours went on (at 367): 
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
         ""In a criminal appeal, the view may be taken that the jury simply followed the judge's instruction to consider separately the case presented by the prosecution in respect of each count and to apply to each count the requirement that all of the ingredients must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Alternatively, the appellant court may conclude that the jury took a ""merciful"" view of the facts upon one count; a function which has always been open to, and exercised by, juries,""  
          
         and they referred with approval to the remarks by King CJ in  
         R v Kirkman 
           
         (1987) 44 SASR 591 at 593. 
         
        
        
       23 Finally they referred to the cases where different verdicts represent an affront to logic and common sense which is unacceptable and strongly suggests a compromise by the jury or confusion or a misunderstanding of their function, and said that it is only where the inconsistency rises to the point that the appellate court considers that the intervention necessary to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction(s) will be set aside.” 
       
      
    56   His Honour then considered the line of decisions mentioned in which (save for Whitmore) an application of the Jones principle had led to convictions being quashed and verdicts of acquittal entered. In summary those decisions give recognition to the circumstance that, where in sexual assault cases with multiple counts involving a single complainant and a single accused, the only direct evidence of the commission of the offences is that of the complainant, then acquittal on any one of the charges will in the absence of an acceptable explanation, normally require acquittal on the remainder. 
    57   This follows from the circumstance that, in such a case, the rejection of the complainant’s evidence will involve a diminution in his or her overall credibility which cannot be overcome, in the absence of some circumstance that might restore that credibility for the other counts. This requires identification of some fact or surrounding circumstance that would provide a rational basis for accepting the complainant’s evidence upon the other counts, ie something which would justify the conclusion that the evidence, on those other counts, was more reliable, or stronger, than it was for the count upon which it was rejected. 
    58   The proper application of these principles was again considered by this Court in its very recent decision of R v Whitehead [2000] NSWCCA 400, a matter bearing some similarity to the present so far as the jury saw fit to convict the appellant, upon the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant, in relation to some but not all counts in the indictment. The appeal was allowed by reason of the court’s conclusion that: 
     
      
       
       “Once the jury found that the evidence of the complainant lacked sufficient cogency to convict on the fifth count, the Crown case on the first and fourth counts wore a different complexion. For it meant that when the complainant’s evidence could be set against other reliable evidence, it failed to carry sufficient conviction to reach the criminal standard of proof. Such an analysis relies, of course, upon views expressed by the majority of the High Court (Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ) in  
       Jones 
        at 454-455.” 
       
      
      
       
      
    59   These remarks are apposite for the present case, having regard to the matters already identified as potentially weakening the strength of the prosecution case, and in particular having regard to the lack of direct corroboration by those witnesses who might have been expected to have seen the serious sexual misconduct which the complainant described. I am not able to identify any logical explanation for the different verdicts; nor am I able to see anything that may have elevated the credibility of the evidence in relation to the counts for which guilty verdicts were returned. 
    60   Once the jury were left in the position, in relation to the 3 December counts, that they were unable to accept the complainant’s explicit evidence concerning the alleged act of sexual intercourse, it is impossible to understand why they chose to accept it in relation to the indecent assault counts. There was nothing in the complainant’s evidence, or in the surrounding circumstances which provided any proper basis for supposing that her evidence was any more reliable in relation to those counts than it was in relation to the counts alleging sexual intercourse. 
    61   Similarly, in relation to the 7 August counts, there is nothing in the complainant’s evidence, or in the surrounding circumstances, which provides a reason for supposing that her uncorroborated evidence was any more reliable in relation to the serious acts of sexual intercourse that were alleged, than it was in relation to the less serious count of assault of JMOS, where it did have some corroboration (from JMOS). 
    62   Moreover, if it were the case that the jury elected to return merciful as distinct from compromise verdicts it is difficult to understand why it chose to acquit on both of the two sexual intercourse charges in relation to 3 December including the back-up charge, and then to convict in relation to the more serious of the charges referable to 7 August. 
    63   I am, accordingly, persuaded that the appeals against conviction should be allowed, the convictions and sentences set aside and verdicts of acquittal substituted. 
    64   O’KEEFE J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL. 
    65   CARRUTHERS AJ: I also agree with Wood CJ at CL.

     Regina v Spiros KOUROUMALOS 
      
    The appellant pleaded guilty to knowingly taking part in the manufacture of the prohibited drug, methylamphetamine, and deemed supply of that drug. In respect of the first count, he was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of two years with an additional term of two years. In respect of the second count he was sentenced to a minimum term of two years and six months with an additional term of one year to be served concurrently with the first charge. The appellant applied to set aside the pleas of guilty, and in the alternative sought leave to appeal against sentence on the grounds that he was denied the opportunity of placing before the court his interpretation of what had occurred.HELD (dismissing the appeal):Setting aside the pleas of guilty1. The applicant must establish that a miscarriage of justice has occurred before the Court will re-open a plea of guilty. What is required is some circumstance which suggests that the plea of guilty was not attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt or that the integrity of the plea is bona fide in question. Boag (1994) 73 ACrimR 35; Cincotta NSWCCA 1 November 1995; Ganderton NSWCCA 17 September 1998; Favero [1999] NSWCCA 320; Vergara [1999] NSWCCA 352 applied.This may occur, for example, where in offering a plea, the accused did not appreciate the nature of the charges; did not intend to admit his or her guilt; could not in law have been convicted of the offences charged; has entered a guilty plea after the trial judge has erroneously decided to admit evidence that would be fatal to the defence; was induced by threats from a fellow accused or police officer where otherwise she or he would not have pleaded guilty; or is persuaded by reason of imprudent and inappropriate advice tendered by his or her legal representative.Chiron 1 NSWLR 218; Liberti (1991) 55 ACrimR 120; Foley (1963) 80 WN 726; Caruso (1988) 37 ACrimR 1; Murphy (1965) VR 187; Favero [1999] NSWCCA 320; Whitehead [2000] NSWCCA 400; Davey NSWCCA 3 March 1995 applied.2. In relation to the applicant’s claim that he was incorrectly advised to plead guilty by his former solicitor, no miscarriage of justice was shown. The applicant knowingly offered the guilty pleas and elected that his wife, rather than he, should give evidence on sentence, with a full appreciation of all matters relevant to making those decisions. The Crown case against the applicant was strong, and the evidence from his former solicitor, explaining that the applicant would have risked doing himself a grave disservice by giving evidence was preferred to the evidence of the applicant. M (1994) 181 CLR 487 appliedSentence3. In relation to the first count, the Crown successfully showed that in popping the Sudafed tablets, in fetching other items needed for the manufacture of the drug, and in providing the premises for storage of some chemical flasks, the appellant was aware that his activities were required for the manufacture of drugs, and therefore knowingly participated in the manufacture.Thompson (1993) 67 ACrimR 308 applied4. In regard to the second count, the appellant provided no evidence to suggest that the quantity of the drug in is possession was for his own use, and given his previous convictions for similar offences, the trial judge was justified in imposing the sentence that he did.

     Regina v Spiros KOUROUMALOS 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   WOOD CJ at CL: On 30 September 1999, the appellant pleaded guilty before Woods DCJ to two charges involving the prohibited drug methylamphetamine. They arose out of Operation Gymea, an extensive police operation directed at Les Kalache and his associates who were extensively involved in the manufacture and distribution of that drug. 
    2   The first count to which the applicant pleaded guilty was one of knowingly take part in the manufacture of methylamphetamine in an amount not less than the commercial quantity of 0.25kg. The second count was one of the deemed supply of 1 ounce of the drug. The applicant was sentenced, in respect of the first count, to imprisonment for a minimum term of two years and to an additional term of two years. In relation to the second count, he was sentenced to a minimum term of one year and six months, and to an additional term of one year, such sentence to be served concurrently with that for the first count. The maximum available penalties for those counts were imprisonment for twenty years and fifteen years respectively. 
    3   The appellant now seeks to re-open the pleas of guilty, and in the alternative seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence. 
     
      
     The Facts 
      
    4   When sentencing the applicant, his Honour had before him a statement of facts, a number of recorded conversations obtained through the use of telephone intercept and listening device warrants, an ERISP, a pre-sentence report, and a report from Mr. Warwick Taylor, as well as evidence from the appellant’s wife. 
    5   The appellant had a history of drug abuse, including convictions on 7th October 1993 in the District Court for three counts of supply of drugs, including methylamphetamine, for which he had been placed upon a recognisance for three years. The recognisance had come to an end before the offences with which he was charged, but it had a relevance so far as it tended to establish that the appellant had some knowledge of the substance methylamphetamine, of which he had, additionally, been a user for some years. 
    6   His Honour sentenced the applicant upon the basis that although he did not have any degree of seniority in the Kalache organisation which undertook the manufacture of the drugs in question, he assisted by running errands for Kalache, in return for which he received some cash as well as methylamphetamine for his own use at reduced prices. His involvement extended to: 
     
      
     a) “popping” ie removing from their foil containers, a very large quantity of Sudafed tablets purchase by the organisation preparatory to the extraction of the pseudoephedrine which they contained, and which was used in the manufacturing process; 
      
      
     b) paying for and collecting ph papers, vacuum grease and 4 x 25-litre drums of acetone from Lab Supplies, each of which substances were required for the manufacture of methylamphetamine; 
      
      
     c) keeping at his home vacuum flasks and other utensils also used in the manufacturing process; and 
      
      
     d) testing the sugar or glucose content of some methylamphetamine supplied to him and reporting back those findings. 
      
    7   In the course of the recorded conversations with Kalache, the appellant spoke of “Louie”, the name commonly used for methylamphetamine, being rhyming slang for the musician and composer Lou Reed or “speed”; discussed the use of “salts”, ie Epsom Salts, a cutting compound used in the manufacturing process; made references to Sudafed and crystals as well as to the sugar or glucose content of some drugs which he had measured with a glucometer; and reported a complaint received from others as to the “Louie” drying up in the syringe. 
    8   In relation to the numbers of Sudafed packets and boxes discussed in these conversations, it was the Crown case, and accepted by his Honour that the pseudoephedrine extracted from them would have produced yields of methylamphetamine, after the reduction that would occur in the manufacturing process, well in excess of the commercial quantity applicable for that substance. 
    9   The deemed supply charge was based upon an intercepted telephone conversation of 10 June 1997, in the course of which the following exchanges occurred: 
     
      
       
       “LK: Yeah. What have you … what … what … how much have you got at home? 
       
      
      
       
       SP: There’s two, three. 
       
      
      
       
       LK I tell you what I’ll do … (…ind…), give me that back. This one I’ll just … I’ll be fair. Alright? What I’ll do, I’ll give you … 
       
      
      
       
       SP An ounce of that. 
       
      
      
       
       LK Right? And an ounce of louie. Right? (claps hands) 
       
      
      
       
       SP And I’ll get the … 
       
      
      
       
       LK You get all that, put “em away, and that’s all square. 
       
      
      
       
       SP Hmmm 
       
      
      
       
       LK Is that fair enough? 
       
      
      
       
       SP Yes, yes.” 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       “LK Yeah. You were gonna get .. you’re gonna get .. you’re gonna get .. your … your … you’ve got that at home, which is enough to get that, and you’ve got money coming in, right? 
       
      
      
       
       SP That’s right, yeah 
       
      
      
       
       LK On top of that, you’ll finish with about four, five hundred yourself. 
       
      
      
       
       SP It’s good, yeah. 
       
      
      
       
       K Alright? Is that fair enough? 
       
      
      
       
       SP Beaut.” 
       
      
      
     No evidence was offered by the applicant to suggest that the ounce of “Louie” referred to, being an amount not less than the trafficable quantity, was for his own use. 
      
    10   His Honour noted, without considering it necessary to extract the conversations in detail that “they amply substantiated the charges and amply justified the pleas entered by the accused”. 
    11   In sentencing the applicant, his Honour appropriately noted: 
     
      
     a) the utilitarian value of the plea; 
      
      
     b) the contrition he displayed as described by his wife; 
      
      
     c) the fact that this was his first time in custody; 
      
      
     d) his condition of diabetes which was likely to make imprisonment more difficult for him; 
      
      
     f) his prior history of drug abuse, and his fragility in that regard. 
      
    12   The two last mentioned matters were regarded as justifying a finding of special circumstances, leading to a longer than usual additional term. 
    13   In pursuing the present appeal, it was accepted that if His Honour’s findings were appropriate, then there was little that could be said in relation to the sentence. Considered against the sentences imposed at first instance, or substituted on appeal, upon the very many other offenders who were caught up in Operation Gymea, it was responsibly accepted that there could be no sustainable argument of parity. 
    14   The application to set aside the plea, and the severity argument were based upon the proposition that the applicant was insufficiently and inappropriately advised in relation to the entry of the plea, and in not being called as a witness to explain the conversations. 
    15   In essence, it was submitted that had the applicant been permitted to explain his position, then the pleas of guilty should not have been entertained or if that were not so, then his objective criminality should have been assessed at an even lower level than that accepted by his Honour. 
     
      
     Application to set aside the pleas of guilty 
      
    16   Before the Court will go behind a plea of guilty, and entertain an appeal against conviction, it must be satisfied that a miscarriage of justice has occurred: Chiron (1980) 1 NSWLR 218 at 231. That may occur for example, where in offering a plea, the applicant did not appreciate the nature of the charges, or did not intend to admit his or her guilt, or where the applicant, on the admitted facts, could not in law have been convicted of the offences charged: Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 at 121-122, and see also Foley (1963) 80 WN 726 and Caruso (1988) 37 A Crim R 1. 
    17   It might also occur where an accused has entered a plea of guilty after a trial Judge has erroneously decided to admit evidence that would be fatal to the defence, as was the case in Chiron; or where an accused is induced by threats from a fellow accused or police officer to plead guilty where otherwise he or she would have pleaded not guilty: Murphy (1965) VR 187 at 190; or where an accused is persuaded to enter a plea of guilty by reason of imprudent and inappropriate advice tendered to him or her by legal representatives; Favero [1999] NSWCCA 320 and Whitehead [2000] NSWCCA 400, or by the Court: Davey NSWCCA 3 March 1995. 
    18   This is not an exhaustive statement of the circumstances in which pleas of guilty may be set aside, but it encompasses those of potential relevance for the present case. 
    19   What is required, for an exercise of the relevant discretion is the identification of some circumstance which indicates that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt or that otherwise the integrity of the plea is bona fide in question: Cincotta NSW CCA 1 November 1995, Ganderton NSWCCA 17 September 1998, Favero, (supra), and Vergara [1999] NSWCCA 352. However, as Kirby P pointed out in Liberti at 122: 
     
      
       
       “For good reasons, courts approach attempts at trial or on appeal in effect to change a plea of guilty or to assert a want of understanding of what was involved in such a plea with caution bordering on circumspection. This attitude rests on the high public interest in the finality of legal proceedings and upon the principle that a plea of guilty by a person in possession of all relevant facts is normally taken to be an admission by that person of the necessary legal ingredients of the offence: see  
       O’Neill 
        [1979] 2 NSWLR 582; (1979) 1 A Crim R 59;  
       Sagiv 
        (1986) 22 A Crim R 73 at 81.” 
       
      
    20   Relevantly for the present case, it may be noted that in Sagiv (1986) 22 A Crim R 73, Lee J, said: 
     
      
       
       “the substantial general proposition which emerges from these cases is that it is a matter for the discretion of the judge presiding as to whether a plea of guilty should be permitted to be withdrawn and that each case must be looked at in regard to its own facts and a decision made whether justice requires that that course be taken. 
       
      
      
       
       It is clear that in the case of mistake of  
       other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt 
       , the court should readily grant leave. But if the plea has been entered  
       in full knowledge of all the facts 
        and intentionally as a plea to the charge which is made, the court is plainly entitled to exercise its discretion against a withdrawal of the plea. The law regards a plea of guilty made by a person  
       in possession of all the facts 
        and intending to plead guilty as an admission of all the legal ingredients of the offence ( 
       O’Neill 
       ) and as the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made, for the court is prepared to act upon it and proceed to conviction or final disposal of the proceedings. [emphasis added]” 
       
      
      
      
     This passage was cited with approval in  
     Davies 
      NSWCCA 16 December 1993 and again in  
     Lars 
      (1994) 73 A Crim R 91. 
      
    21   The onus of establishing that there has been a miscarriage of justice lies on the applicant: Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35 at 36-37. 
    22   The present case is one where the applicant now suggests that he was denied the opportunity of placing before the Court his interpretation of what had occurred, ie of explaining the nature of the role he played in rendering assistance to Kalache. Had he been allowed that opportunity, he argued, relevantly for the present ground, the facts necessary for the convictions that were recorded, would have been lacking, and he should not be held to the pleas of guilty.  
    23   In order to deal with this ground, it is necessary to record that, initially, the applicant was charged with conspiracy to manufacture methylamphetamine. After negotiations with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, this charge was reduced to one of knowingly take part in the manufacture of not less than a commercial quantity of the drug, a charge which more readily permitted the applicant to be sentenced upon the basis of a limited involvement in that activity, and was more favourable than a charge relating to a large commercial quantity which could well have been preferred. 
    24   It is next necessary to turn to the affidavit which he swore in support of the application, to the affidavit provided by Mr. Hovan, his former solicitor, and to their cross examination upon the application before us to set aside the pleas of guilty and to entertain the conviction appeal. 
    25   The applicant asserted in his affidavit and evidence, in summary, that: 
     
      
     a) when he did not give evidence before Judge Woods, this was “the result of a decision made for (him) by … Mr. George Hovan”. (para 2) 
      
      
     b) when he was informed in the District Court that, if he pleaded guilty to knowingly taking part in the manufacture of the drug, the conspiracy charge would be dropped, he was assured that he could explain what part he had in the matter to the Judge; (para 3) 
      
      
     c) he was not once asked to go through the police brief of evidence, and that there were a number of matters in the tapes that he would now wish to explain, and which would have represented the evidence he would have given if called; 
      
      
     d) he had expected Mr. Ramos of counsel to appear for him, but that as Legal Aid had only approved payment for one counsel or solicitor, Mr. Hovan had appeared for him in the sentencing proceedings; (para 4) 
      
      
     e) he had in fact run the errands for Kalache mentioned in the tapes, but that Kalache “did not actually tell me what he wanted the items for, and as I had no idea of the extent of his activities, and as he was supplying me with drugs, I simply did not care what he was doing with the things I purchased for him.” (para 5) 
      
      
     f) the reference to “Louie drying up in the syringe” was a complaint in respect of drugs that he had received from Kalache for his own use, and although the words used were capable of conveying the impression that he had received this complaint from third parties, he did not correct that impression because he thought that he might get a better deal from Kalache if he was thought to be a dealer; (para 6) 
      
      
     g) he did not know why the drums, ph papers and vacuum grease were required; (para 7) 
      
      
     h) the reference to “salts” in one tape, he agreed was for use to cut the powder, while the reference in the same tape to “plastic” he believed was a reference to the half-ounce plastic bags that he had purchased at one time, and which he assumed had been needed “to put powder in, for Les was selling drugs”; (para 10) 
      
      
     i) the references to the “rest of the lab” or “crystals” were references to vacuum glass that had been left at his house, when someone came to collect the drums; (para 13 and evidence) 
      
      
     j) he had “popped” or extracted over 7000 Sudafed tablets for Kalache, which he packed in plastic shopping bags, and took to his unit, but that the reference in this tape to his father helping him in this exercise was an untrue assertion designed to extract a larger payout from Kalache; (para 13 and evidence) 
      
      
     k) the reference to “sugar” that he had detected in testing some of the amphetamines that Kalache had given to him was information that he had passed on to Kalache “not because I thought he was manufacturing the drug”, but to warn him that his supplier was “stuffing it with glucose”, and moreover related to drugs that Kalache had given him for his own use; (para 14) 
      
      
     l) while the errands he ran for Kalache were to support his own habit he tried to indicate to him that he was selling the drugs supplied by him “so he wouldn’t think I was such a big user”. 
      
    26   Mr. Hovan, an experienced criminal trial lawyer, gave evidence that: 
     
      
     a) the conferences held with the applicant were usually conducted with his wife present; (para 3) 
      
      
     b) the entire police brief was given to the applicant so that he and his wife could read the contents, including the transcripts of the telephone intercepts; (para 4) 
      
      
     c) the pleas were entered following agreement by the Crown to drop the conspiracy count from the indictment - a proposition that he considered “reasonable” in the face of the available evidence, it being his assessment that it showed that the applicant had the requisite knowledge as to manufacture taking place in an amount not less than the commercial quantity; (paras 6 and 7) 
      
      
     d) answers given in the ERISP and the contents of the tape were such that the applicant faced potentially embarrassing cross examination that might occasion difficulty for his own credibility, and for his father, if he gave evidence; that might result in him implicating himself to a greater degree in the supply and manufacture of drugs than the fact sheet would suggest; and so far as it might risk losing for him totally the benefit of the contrition otherwise apparent; (paras 8, 11 and 12) 
      
      
     e) he considered the applicant to be a “man of limited intelligence who would not be able to show his best and therefore would not project his best image at sentencing”; (para 10) 
      
      
     f) the sentencing Judge had dealt with the various co-offenders and had a very good grasp of the matters before him. (para 10) 
      
    27   It was in the light of these considerations that Mr. Hovan deposed: (para 9): 
     
      
       
       “I considered as the appellant’s advocate that he should not be exposed to the dangers of the sentencing judge finding him to be a liar and therefore considering that the appellant was covering up his own involvement or at least trying to colour to the best advantage his position in the organisation. At the time of sentencing before the prisoner’s case was called I discussed with the Appellant whether he wanted to enter the witness box. I said: ‘Look, do you want to get in the box. They are not pressing your involvement any more than just as a runner. Do you want to take the risk of giving evidence?’ He said ‘What do you think?’ I said ‘Well its up to you. But Tanya can give all the evidence about your illness and about your drug use. It doesn’t expose you to cross examination that may bring out matters that you can’t answer’. He said ‘yeah well if you thinks its better’ I said, ‘well she would do a good job and you don’t have to bring up all the matters in your record of interview which you can’t explain’. He said ‘OK’ I then called Tanya his wife to give all of the subjective evidence on behalf of the appellant.” 
       
      
    28   I am in no doubt that the evidence of Mr. Hovan is to be preferred to that of the applicant, who impressed me as a witness of very little credibility. Having read his account, and having listened to his cross examination, I am quite unable to accept his assertion today that he did not know the reason for his errands, or that Kalache was using the Sudafed tablets that he ‘popped’, and the other articles he purchased, for the manufacture of methylamphetamine. Such assertions I am satisfied are completely untrue, and proffered only because of the applicant’s dissatisfaction with the sentence that was imposed. 
    29   The matters that persuade me to this view include the following: 
     
      
     a) the circumstanced that he was more than familiar with the substance methylamphetamine both as a long term user between 1991 and the date of his arrest and a supplier of it; 
      
      
     b) the knowing manner in which he spoke of the drug and the materials used in its manufacture in the course of the intercepted conversations, for example his complaint at one stage that “someone stuffed” the “other one” that “had 30, 35 milligrams of sugar”; 
      
      
     c) the obviously complicit observations attributed to him in the intercepted conversations; 
      
      
     d) the answers given in the ERISP, for example his denials of going to Lab Supplies, of popping any Sudafed tablets for Kalache, and of ever having any Sudafed tablets at his premises, other than one or two packets for himself; his pretence at one stage of not knowing Kalache’s surname; and his suggestion that the reference to sugar had something to do with a “drink” - all of which were inconsistent with the evidence that he gave on this application and with the intercepted conversations; 
      
      
     e) the admissions he made to Warwick John Taylor, as recorded in the history that the latter took for the purpose of preparing the psychometric assessment that was tendered upon sentence - namely his statement that “he does have an awareness that what he was doing was wrong and that he was aware of the purpose of the tasks that Les (Kalache) was asking him to undertake”. 
      
      
     f) the admissions he made to the author of the pre-sentence report that was similarly tendered upon sentence - namely his admission “that he was a messenger and courier in the drug operation and that what he did was out of loyalty to Kalache and to maintain a supply of amphetamines for his personal use.” 
      
      
     g) the evidence that his wife gave on sentence which was not contradicted or withdrawn by her when this application came before this court, viz that before the pleas were entered, they had discussed the offence and that the applicant had: 
      
      
       
        “entered a plea of guilty because (a) he’s guilty and (b) he’s remorseful about his role … on both counts”.  
       
      
      
     She was then asked; 
      
      
       
       “Q. Now being his wife do you think he is genuine about that? A. Definitely he is. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Has he expressed anything to you about his remorse in relation to the matter? A. Yes he has. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. What has he said to you? A. He regrets everything, he regrets knowing him, put it that way and he’s sorry that it’s come to this and he’s put everyone through a lot of stress, specially his mother and father and just taken - it’s just made him work like a lot more except like to do with this he’s anxious and just stressed out. That’s he is very sorry about that, what’s - I mean he is.” 
       
      
    30   In cross examination she confirmed, no doubt from her discussions with the applicant, that his role was “exactly” that described in the pre-sentence report, namely that he had been a messenger and courier in the drug operation. 
    31   I am satisfied, from the poor account that the applicant gave when cross examined in this Court, as to the correctness of Mr. Hovan’s assessment that he would have risked doing his case a grave disservice by giving evidence. I am similarly satisfied that he realised that the Crown case against him was strong, that it was well made out on the transcripts, and that he knowingly offered the pleas of guilty with an appreciation of all matters relevant to that decision. 
    32   Additionally, I am satisfied upon the basis of Mr. Hovan’s evidence, that he was presented with the opportunity of giving evidence, that he received competent and correct advice as to the undesirability of taking that course, and that he elected instead to allow his wife to give the evidence that she could offer of his remorse and subjective circumstances. 
    33   For these reasons, the applicant has in my view failed to show that there was any risk of a miscarriage of justice, arising out of any of the circumstances previously mentioned. The application to set aside the pleas should be dismissed. 
     
      
     Sentence 
      
    34   Identical considerations apply to the application for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence. It was not the Crown case that the applicant participated directly in any “cook”. 
    35   Its case in relation to the first count was that, being aware that the Sudafed tablets he popped, and the other items he fetched, were required for the manufacture of the prohibited drugs, he “knowingly participated in their manufacture” by carrying out those activities. They were necessary steps in the operation, as was the provision of his premises as a place to pop the Sudafed tablets from which the required pseudoephedrine was recovered, and to store the chemical flasks needed for a cook. It was in that sense that he knowingly participated in the manufacture of the drugs. That was sufficient as a matter of law: see S 6 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985: Thomas (1993) 67 A Crim R 308 at 310. 
    36   Similarly in relation to the second count there was, in the telephone intercept and the admitted facts, evidence to support the offence of deemed supply of one ounce of amphetamine, that being the basis on which the Crown case was presented in the Facts Sheet. The applicant offered no evidence to suggest that the quantity of drug referred to in the relevant transcript was for his own use (S 29 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act) and his Honour was fully justified in imposing the sentence imposed in the light of the previous convictions for similar offences. 
    37   Nothing has been placed before this Court to suggest in relation to either count, that his Honour overstated the basis of the applicant’s criminality or elevated him to a higher rung in the operation than the evidence clearly justified. Upon that basis, and in the absence of any omission by his Honour to take into account any relevant subjective circumstance, no error has been shown. 
    38   I would accordingly propose the following orders; 
     
      
     1. Motion to set aside the pleas of guilty and appeal against conviction dismissed. 
      
      
     2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted but appeal dismissed. 
      
    39   STUDDERT J: I have had the benefit of considering the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in draft form. 
    40   I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour and with the reasons he has expressed for the making of such orders. 
    41   WHEALY J: I agree with the reasons of Wood CJ at CL and the orders that he proposes.

     REGINA v Russell BAMBLETT 
      
    The appellant appealed from his conviction on three counts of having had sexual intercourse with a female child under the age of ten. No medical evidence was tendered at trial as the complainant had previously been abused by another person. The complainant gave evidence which was both internally inconsistent and also inconsistent with evidence previously given in another trial. In his summing up, the trial Judge suggested to the jury that the complainant’s allegations went beyond the capacities of a child her age as to the detail and nature of the sexual activities described. Counsel for the accused made no objection to this. Held (by Sheller JA, James and Dowd JJ agreeing):-1. The trial Judge quite appropriately impressed upon the jury that the directions he gave were not given because of any view he had formed about the evidence but because they were required by law.2. However, there was a real danger that the trial Judge might have led the jury to believe that because of her age, the complainant had no capacity to invent the sexual activities described. This would have been dangerous as the complainant had previously been sexually abused and nothing was known of the nature of that abuse.3. The inconsistency in the complainant’s evidence must be viewed in the context of an earlier occasion of sexual abuse. The extent and nature of that sexual abuse was unknown and would not be known to a jury if there were to be a new trial. This element of unreliability in the complainant’s evidence added to the significance of the inconsistencies in her evidence and, accordingly, the conduct of the trial resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Any new trial would involve a further miscarriage of justice.

     REGINA v Russell BAMBLETT  
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1    SHELLER JA: Russell Bamblett (Snr) appeals from his conviction on three counts that on a single occasion between 25 December 1996 and 27 March 1997 at Dubbo, he had sexual intercourse with a female child under the age of ten. The trial began at Dubbo on 13 December 1999 before his Honour Judge Freeman and a jury. On 15 December 1999 the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. Judge Freeman sentenced the appellant on the first count to a fixed term of imprisonment for two years, on the second count to a fixed term of imprisonment for two and a half years and on the third count to five years penal servitude. Each sentence was concurrent with the others and began 15 December 1999. His Honour found special circumstances and fixed a minimum term of three years and an additional term of two years on the third count. The appellant does not appeal against the sentences imposed. 
     
      
    2    The Crown case can be summarised in the following way. The complainant was born on 11 October 1989. The appellant had been a friend of the complainant’s family for some years and, on occasions, was invited to babysit the complainant and her siblings, one of whom was slightly older and several younger than she. The complainant gave evidence that the offences charged took place on a day when her parents had gone shopping and left her and her “brothers” and sisters in the care of the appellant whom she called “Uncle Russ”. The complainant said she was inside the house watching television while her “brothers” and sisters were in the backyard. (The evidence was that the complainant’s second brother “B” was born on 30 March 1997). While she was watching television the appellant was in her mother’s room. He called out to her and said “[Name] come in here”. When she did not go, the appellant dragged her by the wrist to her mother’s bedroom.  
     
      
    3    The complainant gave evidence that she was wearing a one-piece swimming costume. She said that the appellant pulled her swimming costume down. He put her on the bed and pulled his own tracksuit pants down. The complainant said that she saw the appellant’s “private”. She said that the complainant licked her “private” (count 1) and that he put his “private” into her “private” (count 3). She said that the appellant put his finger into her “private” (count 2) and that he did that before he put his “private” into her “private”.  
     
      
    4    The complainant said that the appellant had said to her “don’t tell your mum”. She said that when her parents returned from shopping, she did not tell them about what the appellant had done because the appellant had told her not to.  
     
      
    5    In cross-examination the complainant said that while she was in Year 2 at school she had two teachers. The first teacher was Mr Ford and the second Miss Dakin. She said that the offences took place on a school day at a time when she was in Miss Dakin’s class. Detective Edmondson gave evidence that the first school term in 1997 ran from 4 February to 27 March. The complainant said that she was able to remember a time when the appellant and his daughters packed their furniture on to a truck and moved. She said that the offences occurred before the move. The complainant’s younger brother, B, was born on 30 March 1997. The complainant said that the offences took place before B was born. She also said that when the offences occurred, the appellant said to her “Don’t tell your mum or I’ll kill your mum and [B]”.  
     
      
    6    The complainant’s mother gave evidence that at some stage in 1997 she had a conversation with the complainant about the appellant. After the conversation, the complainant’s mother contacted the police. The complainant’s mother said that at the time she contacted the police her son, B, was 12 days old. In cross-examination she conceded that B was 16 days old at the time she spoke to the police. 
     
      
    7    The appellant gave evidence and was cross-examined. He said that in January and February 1997 he lived in Dubbo. He knew the complainant’s parents and from time to time he would look after their children. He denied the allegations the complainant made against him.  
     
      
    8    The appellant said that on 12 February 1997 he went to Gilgandra to attend Court with his son. He stayed in Gilgandra and spent a week with his niece, Miss Sally Anne Carr, and a further week with his sister-in-law, Mrs Maria Fuller. While he was in Gilgandra he arranged to rent a house there. He returned to Dubbo and organised the removal of his furniture. The appellant said that he took up residence at Gilgandra on either 2 or 3 March 1997. 
     
      
    9    In his cross-examination, the appellant initially said that he spent one night in Dubbo before returning to Gilgandra. He later said that it was “probably correct” that he had spent three or four days in Dubbo.  
     
      
    10    Miss Carr, Mrs Fuller and Mrs Fay Kearney, the appellant’s sister, gave evidence to confirm that the appellant had spent time in Gilgandra during February 1997. 
     
      
       
      No medical evidence 
       
      
    11    At the trial Mr Wilson appeared for the appellant. Before the Crown prosecutor opened to the jury, the following is noted in the transcript: 
     
      
       
        
        “IN THE ABSENCE OF THE JURY 
        
       
       
        
        (Crown Prosecutor indicates there will be no medical evidence in this trial due to the fact that the alleged victim [complainant] had been previously assaulted by another person, therefore it renders the medical evidence equivocal).” 
        
       
      
    12    During a short adjournment, after the evidence was complete but before the addresses, the trial Judge received a note from the jury and asked to discuss the questions with counsel in the absence of the jury. The transcript continues as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “IN THE ABSENCE OF THE JURY 
        
       
       
        
        MFI #2 QUESTIONS FROM THE JURY 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Question, ‘What happened, for [the complainant] to tell her mother, what has brought this up? Is there any medical evidence for [the complainant], did mother take her to doctor? Did [the complainant’s] behaviour change, ask both parents? When was this reported to the police, what date?’ As to the first, what happened to [the complainant] to tell her mother, what’s brought this up, there is simply no evidence. Is there any medical evidence for [the complainant], did her mother take her to the doctor, same answer. Did [the complainant’s] behaviour change ask both parents, same answer. When was this reported to the police, what date? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I think there was evidence that that occurred on 15 April-- 
        
       
       
        
        WILSON: We would allow that your Honour because that was the day the complaint - and the statement was made on the 22nd but Mrs Fuller did go to the police so I don’t know whether that was clearly put into evidence but she got the complaint -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, she did mention 15 April, didn’t she? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: There was mention of -- 
        
       
       
        
        WILSON: I certainly got her to - because she said twelve days after baby was born and I asked her, well, if you’ll accept that the 15th, is the day she was told. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: That’s alright. Now, what - apart from saying there is no evidence, you have to put those matters out of your mind, concentrate on what material you do have, what other answer is there available for the first three? 
        
       
       
        
        WILSON: That has to be the answer, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown seems lost in thought. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I accept that that has to be the answer but I was wondering in particular circumstances of this whether there should be some gloss put on to that because the question of medical evidence is clearly important and it clearly falls into the category of evidence that anyone would expect that if there was evidence or if there was not evidence, then that would be placed before the jury but in the particular circumstances of this case, the view that I formed and indeed the view that was formed at the earlier trial was that that evidence -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Is simply inadmissible under 409B. [s409B of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900 since repealed and transferred to the  
        Criminal Procedure Act 
         1986 s105]. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Not necessarily that your Honour, that the problem was that there was, the medical evidence when [the complainant] was examined and that occurred on 8 April prior to the complaint in relation to this matter, was that there was scarring on the hymen. And your Honour, that could only have - being prejudicial and misleading perhaps because of 409B because the jury couldn’t have been told the full story. But your Honour, I’m just wondering whether or not it’s possible for your Honour to say in relation to the medical evidence that clearly they shouldn’t speculate and in the normal course of events they might expect to be told one way or the other but that they should accept that there is no evidence and it’s very, very important that they should not speculate. I think it should be brought home to them, I’m sorry if I’m not explaining this very well but that in the normal course of events either from the defence point of view or from the Crown point of view they would expect that there would be medical evidence, that they might therefore accept or expect that there is a particular reason or good reason why there is no such evidence but even that there is that good reason, they should not speculate or seem to guess at what it might be. And your Honour, the other aspect of the medical evidence is that that may be coupled with an explanation in relation to what it is that the Crown has to prove and that is that the Crown does not have to prove penetration of the vagina but merely the slightest degree of penetration of the genitalia. Your Honour, that’s the only submission that I can make in relation to it. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: What do you say about it Mr Wilson, is there anything wrong with saying we might expect that sort of evidence would be forthcoming. You might therefore reach the conclusion that there’s a very good reason for it not forthcoming, simply do not try and guess what that reason is and certainly do not speculate about what the evidence might do and might not be. 
        
       
       
        
        WILSON: In a sense that may actually invite them to speculate to some extent your Honour because we’re not saying there was never a medical examination and they’ll be in effect and we can’t say that but to actually alert their minds to the possible existence of some material that they haven’t received for whatever good reason that might be, in a sense, alerts them that there may be something in existence but we’re not getting it. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: It’s a matter of simple logic that they would understand there is something in existence, which they’re not getting. The Crown’s suggestion is really only to try and strengthen the admonition to them not to --  
        
       
       
        
        WILSON: Not to speculate, yes, I know, I understand. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: -- start guessing. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: And your Honour similarly and I suppose this should be recorded from the Crown position as to why there is no evidence in relation to what happened immediately prior to [the complainant] telling her mother again, that may have been or probably would have been precluded by 409B because she had returned from a counselling session in relation to another offence and it was in the course of that conversation concerning that counselling session that the allegation concerning this matter emerged and again your Honour, that’s why that area was left alone and particularly because this is a retrial. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: They probably would have had difficulties after Graham (?) [ 
        Graham v The Queen 
         (1998) 195 CLR 606] anyway. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Indeed, your Honour. That was the other aspect of it that because of the dates of the offence is uncertain it was clearly not within days of the complaint that  
        Graham’s case 
         probably would have excluded it. So your Honour, I would simply make the same submission your Honour that they’d be given a very strong direction of not to speculate. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Having voiced your uncertainties about what the effect of this is, Mr Wilson, what do you suggest ought to be said? I didn’t quite understand whether in the end you came down to submitting that no such directions should be given or what? 
        
       
       
        
        WILSON: If the hypothesis that the jury will in their minds suspect at least that there is in existence something, perhaps it’s best to tell them that the Crown has led all the evidence that he is able to lead in this matter and-- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: What, as a matter of law? 
        
       
       
        
        WILSON: As a matter of law. As a fact and as a matter of law, yes. Not quite as a fact, that’s right, as a matter of law, yes. And it has led all the evidence it is able to lead in this matter and they should not speculate any further about that. I don’t know how you can ever explain in a way - in any other way your Honour because if your Honour mentions the very existence of medical examinations or certificates and then says, don’t speculate why you haven’t got one-- 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, could I suggest this that if it’s framed in the way my friend suggests then, that the Crown has done all it could, the inference is well, if there was something better the Crown would have done it. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, that’s right. I think that really operates against the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: If it’s done in the way that I suggested that -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Both sides have done as much as they could. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well, it may-- 
        
       
       
        
        WILSON: No onus on me, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: It may have some impact there, your Honour, perhaps a neutral way of doing it would be simply to tell the jury that they would understand, that there are very strict rules governing the way in which evidence is adduced and what evidence can be adduced that all those rules had been complied with and that the materials that are not before them they should not in any way speculate as to why that is so and just assure them that all parties have complied with the various evidentiary rules that they are obliged to follow. 
        
       
       
        
        WILSON: Just with reference to the materials that are not before, that worries me, your Honour. It alerts them to the fact that there-- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Any material that they might think should be before them but isn’t-- 
        
       
       
        
        WILSON: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Perhaps put it in that sort of frame. 
        
       
       
        
        WILSON: Yes, that’s the way, thank you, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Whether it exists or not. 
        
       
       
        
        WILSON: Yes, that’s right. Certainly. And that yes, the last question can be answered as to the date. Because - and your Honour could say that you know in evidence that on 22 April the statement was given to Constable Chapman (?) [Constable Tony Chapman who took the complainant’s statement on 22 April 1997 but did not give evidence]. Whether or not - the other part about the behaviour is not a matter that is probably admissible without expert evidence. It’s just inadmissible your Honour. So there is simply just no evidence about that, the behaviour change. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: The note I’ve made is to this effect, let’s see if this is in accordance with your joint submissions. I would propose to tell them there are very strict rules about evidence, what can be led and how. Both parties have complied with those rules in this trial. You might think that there could be other material in existence which is not being presented to you. You must not speculate as to whether such other material does exist or not and you certainly must not speculate as to what that material might establish if it existed. You should leave aside any other queries you may have or hopes or expectations in relation to the evidence and concentrate solely on the material which has in fact been put before you. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        WILSON: Yes, thank you. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Does that suit you both? 
        
       
       
        
        WILSON: Yes, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Certainly, your Honour, yes. And your Honour, there is the answer to the one question. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, the one question of 15th of April 
        
       
       
        
        IN THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Members of the jury, thank you, for your note which for the record I read as follows: ‘What happened for [the complainant] to tell her mother, what has brought this up, is there any medical evidence for [the complainant], did mother take her to doctor, did [the complainant’s] behaviour change, ask both parents, when was this reported to the police, what date?’ 
        
       
       
        
        Now I can remind you of the evidence which has been led in relation to the last of those queries. The evidence is the 15th of April 1997. And you know that the statement was in fact taken in detail from [the complainant] on 22 April. So the police were contacted on the 15th and the full statement was taken on the 22nd and that’s part of the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        Your other queries however, caused me to give you these directions as a matter of law, reminding you of something I said when I was dealing with the way in which you can ask questions, directing them to me because I said then there are rules about what can be asked, sometimes on how it can be asked and so on. There are very strict rules about evidence in the way of what can be led and how. Both parties to this trial have complied with those rules. You might think that there could be other material in existence, which has not been presented to you. You must not however speculate as to whether such other material does in fact exist or not. You most certainly must not speculate about what that other material might establish if it in fact existed. You should leave aside any other questions which are not covered by the evidence or any hopes that you might have or any expectations that you might have. You must concentrate only on the material that has in fact been presented to you.” 
        
       
       
      Counsel then addressed and the trial Judge summed up to the jury. 
       
       
      Summing Up 
       
      
    13    Early in the summing up, the trial Judge, having given directions about the respective functions of judge and jury, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “So I will keep my directions or my references to the evidence as brief as I think I can consistent of course with my obligation to give you a full set of directions about the law. That approach however requires that I give you a couple of warnings. The first is that simply because I refer to some part of the evidence and not to others, that does not limit you to the parts to which I have referred nor does it mean that the parts that I have referred to are the important parts and the rest is somehow of less importance. 
        
       
       
        
        …. 
        
       
       
        
        The second warning I should give you is that because it is not my job to decide the facts, I endeavour at least to follow a policy of not expressing any view of my own about what the facts are or what you should find them to be. If you think I fail in that, if you think you picked up some hint or some indication from me of my opinion on the facts, it is important that you remember you are not only entitled to disregard my opinion on the facts, you are indeed obliged to disregard my opinion on the facts unless of course it happens to coincide with some view you have yourselves independently formed. I repeat, it is your job to decide the facts not mine.” 
        
       
      
    14    Later in the summing up, the trial Judge made two observations of a general nature about “all witnesses in all trials.” In the course of those observations, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The human faculty of recollection is subject of course to decay as you understand and in this case you are dealing with the capacity to articulate on the one hand of a child who is now ten and talking about events which are in fact almost three years ago and so on. 
        
       
       
        
        That does not mean of course in relation to [the complainant] that because she is a child, you simply overlook any shortcomings, flaws or errors in her evidence. But it does mean that you are required to apply to her the standards that you would find appropriate to a child talking about things relatively a long time ago and not expect her to perform in the way in which you would expect an adult. And you will remember when I was talking a moment ago about the circumstance in which one’s powers of observation are called upon, that she, if you accept what she says, was subjected to what must have been a very stressful experience in the life of an eight-year-old. Now, stress can itself affect the way in which people make observations and I am sure you have been in a situation of being under stress and finding that some things are indelibly imprinted in your recollection and you have probably also realised that some of the things that were going on around you did not register at all and so on. So that stress can have an effect both in terms of sharpening and in terms of blunting one’s powers of observation, recollection and so on.” 
        
       
      
    15     Further on the trial Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “And bear in mind of course that it is not a question of you choosing to prefer one side or the other, the obligation I have explained to you is on the Crown to satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt, which it attempts to do on the basis of the girl’s evidence alone and if the Crown persuades you to that level of satisfaction, then you convict. If you have a reasonable doubt, then you do not convict, you indeed acquit. 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence upon which the Crown seeks to persuade you comes of course from [the complainant] and [the complainant] alone. Again as the Crown observed, it is not uncommon that there should be only the one witness in cases of this nature because these activities are not normally engaged in in the presence of witnesses. But whenever there is only one witness to a crime, I am obliged to, as a matter of law not because of any view I have myself formed about [the complainant] either positive or negative but nonetheless I am obliged to give you this caution and when you hear it, you will understand that it is no more than common sense anyway. The caution is that you must approach her evidence with particular care and scrutinise it with great care because she is the only witness against the accused. And really all that means is that the Crown having the obligation to satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, if it has only one witness whose evidence is capable of doing that, then it makes perfectly good sense that you should be careful in the scrutiny you apply to that witness to make sure that that witness’s evidence does satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    16    Further on and dealing with Mr Wilson’s address to the jury, the trial Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “And Mr Wilson says, well, there you are she did not make any complaint and you would expect her to make a complaint and the fact that she does not tell her parents or her mother at least when she returns to the scene is an indicator that there was nothing to complain about; that these things in fact did not happen. And whenever that submission is made, I am again obliged as a matter of law and not because of any view I have formed in this trial to give you certain directions. The first of those directions is that certainly if somebody does not complain, then that is obviously consistent with there being nothing to complain about. But I am also obliged to warn you in cases of sexual assault that there may be many reasons why a person does not complain either immediately or indeed at all. And the fact that they make no complaint does not prove that there was nothing to complain about. In this case, leaving aside questions like the general nature of children and making complaints and so on, [the complainant] says that she did not complain because the accused had in fact made a threat, telling her not to tell her mother or he would bash or kill both her mother and her baby brother, [B]. And of course counsel made a number of points in relation to that aspect as well. The Crown making the point as I understood it, that for a child who was eight at the time that she went to the police about these things and ten now, to have injected the element of there being a threat made by the accused, a threat in fairly sophisticated terms to not only her mother but her unborn sibling is the sort of thing that you would find persuasive as indicating that this is a detail you would not expect an eight year old to come up with. On the other hand, Mr Wilson says that the threat could not have been made in the terms in which [the complainant] says it was made because the accused could not have said I will bash or kill your mother and [B] because on any view of it [B], not being born until 30 March, was not born at the time at which these events took place if they took place. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown in answer to that, again as I understood his argument said that if you are dealing with an eight or a ten year old, the fact that the child has since been born under the name [B], is an indistinguishable thing from the unnamed ‘child’ who was in her mother’s womb at the time, so you do not read anything particular into that whereas Mr Wilson says that you take it literally and that is what she is asking you to do and you do read into that, that she is talking about an impossibility. It is a matter for you what effect those arguments have on your mind. But that is all I need to tell you about the making of the complaint or the failure to make a complaint at that time. She says that is the reason she did not do it. Ultimately of course she did go to the police and we know on 15 April and made the full statement a week or so later on the 22nd.” 
        
       
      
    17    Later in the summing up, the trial Judge came back to remind the jury of some of the arguments that had been put by counsel. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[n]ot necessarily all of them but I will take you through to remind you very briefly of some of the things they said in order to assist your recollection by refreshing them.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour referred first to the arguments put by the Crown prosecutor and, in particular, his argument about the truth of the complainant’s evidence. His Honour then said: 
       
       
        
        “I have already mentioned the idea of the sophisticated threat being in his submission beyond the capacities of a child of her age and the sort of details which she invested her story with like the accused going to the toilet and the order in which these sexual activities took place being what you would expect of sexual activities of this nature, although not of course involving a child but indeed beyond the capacity of a child to get what you might think was the correct sequence.” 
        
       
      
    18    In this passage, the trial Judge was seeking to summarise what the Crown prosecutor had said in his address and without objection. The Crown prosecutor had said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now you see [the complainant] told you as part of these events that occurred in the bedroom that the accused threatened her, that he said to her something to the effect that ‘Look I’ll harm your mother and [B].’ And she made no complaint about these events when her parents came back from shopping. You might think that if such a threat had been made to such a young child that it would be natural for that child not to say anything if the complaint was effective, if the threat was effective there would be no complaint. She says this was the threat that was made. That threat, you might think for an eight year old child thinking back on it giving evidence two years later, is a fairly difficult kind of thing to articulate because the threat was to the effect that it’s made when her mother is pregnant, her mother subsequently gives birth to the child [B] and in the evidence of [the complainant] the threat is ‘Well look I’ll hurt your mother and [B].’ That threat in the Crown’s submission was made and was effective because it was that [the complainant] never complained to her mother at the time they returned from shopping. Now it may be that you would know and it may be that his Honour will give you some direction about it, that there might be any number of reasons why people delay complaining about sexual matters or never complain about them at all. But the fact that there is a delay in making a complaint doesn’t mean that when eventually [the complainant] comes to tell people what has happened to her isn’t true. That threat that the accused made and the complexity of the threat, that is in relation to the unborn child being harmed as well, is a complexity in [the complainant’s] story that in the Crown’s submission simply wouldn’t be there unless it was that she was telling the truth. You might think that that little gloss on the story is something that a child couldn’t put there unless it was true. 
        
       
       
        
        Just in relation to those little details, [the complainant’s] evidence was that when these events came to an end the accused left and went to the toilet. And again in the Crown’s submission that’s another detail that gives you an insight into the truthfulness of [the complainant’s] account. The order of the events that she describes may be distasteful but she describes that there was a licking of the vagina, that there was then an insertion of the finger and that there was then an insertion of the penis. That order, that chronology is something that in the Crown’s submission you might expect the chronology to be and again is a detail that lets you look at the truthfulness of her account.” 
        
       
      
    19    The part of the summing up on which grounds 3 and 4 of the appellant’s appeal are based is that part of the quotation which starts with the words “the sort of details” down to “correct sequence.” A little later in the summing up, when dealing with Mr Wilson’s address to the jury, the trial Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ He suggested to you, the impression you would have had from her was not that which you would expect of a child who had been sexually assaulted as she claimed.” 
        
       
      
    20    Shortly afterwards the summing up ended and no relevant exception was taken to it. 
     
      
    21    The jury retired to consider its verdict on 14 December. Thereafter a note was received from the jury “Audio tape required for when Mr Crown questioned [the complainant] on when she was dragged into the bedroom and then when he went to the toilet”. Later, the foreperson indicated that what was required was the whole questioning from when the complainant was actually dragged until the appellant went to the toilet. The jury returned with its verdict the next morning. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    22    In his remarks on sentence, the trial Judge said that the appellant was of aboriginal descent. At the age of twenty he formed a relationship from which there were three children. His two daughters are now in their teens and are doing well in high school. The appellant was, for a time at least, the sole carer. He had a close relationship with them. The appellant’s son aged nineteen was in a somewhat different category. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I was told during the course of the trial that he [the son] is in prison for sexually abusing the same victim and hence there was no medical evidence called, despite the positive findings of penetration, on medical examination of the child because there was no way of distinguishing between the damage done by this prisoner or by the other offender.” 
        
       
      
    23    At the end of the remarks on sentence, the Crown prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour one very minor matter in relation to Russell Bamblett junior the term of imprisonment that he is serving in fact relates to one of [the complainant’s] siblings and not to her.” 
        
       
       
      Apparently, it had also been alleged that the son had sexually assaulted the complainant. 
       
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    24    The appellant relied on the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The learned trial judge erred in qualifying his warning to approach the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant with caution with the words ‘I am obliged as a matter of law not because of any view I have myself formed about [the complainant] either positive or negative but nonetheless I’m obliged to give you this warning’. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The learned trial judge erred in qualifying his warning as to the absence of complaint with the words preceding the warning ‘And whenever that submission is made, I am again obliged just as a matter of law and not because of any view I have formed in this trial to give you certain directions.’ 
        
       
       
        
        3. The learned trial judge erred in characterising the Crown case as one suggesting that the allegations were ‘beyond the capacities of a child of her age’ as to the detail and nature of the sexual activities described. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The verdict was unreasonable and a jury acting reasonably should have had a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt.” 
        
       
      
    25    Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules provides that no direction or omission to direct given by the Judge presiding at the trial shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction or omission by the party appealing. At this trial, the appellant’s counsel took no objection to the directions now complained of in grounds 1, 2 and 3. 
     
      
    26    In R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 in a judgment with which Gleeson CJ agreed and Mahoney JA agreed generally, Hunt J said at 536 that the requirements of rule 4 did not constitute some mere technicality which might simply be brushed aside 
     
      
       
        
        “the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted under one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which he could and should have raised at the first trial. 
        
       
       
        
        There are, of course, cases in which the error made is of such a nature that, notwithstanding the failure of counsel for the accused to comply with that duty, leave will be granted to avoid a miscarriage of justice. The scope of r4 was discussed by this Court in  
        R v Tripodina 
         (1988) 35 A CrimR 183 at 191-195, and it is unnecessary to repeat what was said there.” 
        
       
      
    27    Mr Craigie, who appeared for the appellant on his appeal, faced this problem squarely and referred us to BRS v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 275. In that case the majority of the High Court upheld an appeal on the basis that there was a miscarriage of justice as the result of the trial Judge’s failure to direct the jury according to law, because the jury might have convicted the accused by a reasoning process that a proper direction would have denied to them. At 306, McHugh J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Trial judges have no authority to dispense with the directions that the law requires them to give in criminal trials. If the failure to give a direction may have resulted in the conviction of the accused person, the trial has not been conducted according to law and the conviction constitutes a miscarriage of justice. It is no answer that the directions which were given or not given gave the accused a better chance of acquittal than the directions that the law required. A person is entitled to be tried according to law. If the failure to give a required direction may have brought about the accused’s conviction, there is a miscarriage of justice. 
        
       
       
        
        So a critical question in the present case is whether there is a real chance that the omission to give directions concerning W’s evidence may have been the factor that resulted in the appellant’s conviction.” 
        
       
      
    28    It is appropriate to consider first whether the directions complained of, or any of them, gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. It is convenient to deal first with ground 3. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    29    The appellant submitted that the direction suggesting that the complainant’s allegations were “beyond the capacities of a child of her age” as to the detail and nature of the sexual activities described gave the Crown the benefit of a consideration which it did not seek and to which it was not entitled. In their context the particular words complained of were: “the sort of details which she invested her story with like the accused going to the toilet and the order in which these sexual activities took place being what you would expect of sexual activities of this nature, although not of course involving a child but indeed beyond the capacity of a child to get what you might think was the correct sequence.” There was some debate between counsel and the bench about whether this passage went beyond, as the appellant submitted, what the Crown prosecutor said in addressing the jury.  
     
      
    30    The passage from the Crown prosecutor’s address which I have quoted deals with the terms of the threat said by the complainant to have been made to her by the appellant and the delay in her complaint. It deals with the threat as an explanation for the delay and the reference in the threat to the unborn child as a gloss that a child could not put there unless it was true. The complainant’s evidence about the appellant leaving and going to the toilet was submitted to be “another detail that gives you an insight into the truthfulness of [the complainant’s] account”. The order of events is referred to and the Crown prosecutor said:  
     
      
       
        
        “That order, that chronology is something that in the Crown’s submission you might expect the chronology to be and again is a detail that lets you look at the truthfulness of her account.”  
        
       
      
    31    Nothing is said to suggest to the jury that these matters were “beyond the capacities of a child of her age” to invent, beyond the statement in relation to the threat of the harm to the unborn child about which the Crown prosecutor said: “You might think that that little gloss on the story is something that a child couldn’t put there unless it was true.”  
     
      
    32    In my opinion, the learned trial Judge took this further, though I accept quite unintentionally, when he linked the phrase “sexual activities of this nature” with the “capacity of a child” and this capacity to getting “the correct sequence”. Put bluntly, this passage in the context of the summing up as a whole could well have left the jury with the impression that the sexual activities the complainant described would have been beyond her capacity to invent because of her age. In this trial this was dangerous territory. On the material before this Court and perhaps before the trial Judge, it is difficult to assess the extent of that danger. The Judge was told that the complainant had been previously assaulted by another person. Because of this sexual abuse, no medical evidence was called “because there was no way of distinguishing between the damage done by [the appellant] or by the other offender.” 
     
      
    33    The parties had agreed that it would be unfair to the appellant to allow the jury to think that because of the capacities of a child of her age, the complainant could not have invented the sexual activities she described. Nothing is known about the nature of the other sexual abuse, when it took place and whether it involved one occasion or more than one occasion. The parties accepted that all such evidence was inadmissible, perforce of s409B of the Crimes Act 1900, then in force. Perhaps more accurately, the Crown saw it as equivocal. All this made it the more important that the jury did not think that because of the age of the complainant she could not have invented the sexual activities she described.  
     
      
    34    To some extent the argument became one of whether the Crown prosecutor had been permitted without objection to trespass into this dangerous area and whether the trial Judge was doing any more than reminding the jury of what the Crown prosecutor had said. Further, reference was made to the trial Judge’s account of Mr Wilson’s submission to the jury that the impression they would have had from the complainant “was not that which you would expect of a child who had been sexually assaulted as she claimed”. According to the summing up that was a different point based on the complainant appearing open, friendly and unemotional or in an emotionally unscarred way. In my opinion, there was a real danger that the jury may have been led to believe that because of her age the complainant had no capacity to invent the sexual activities she described. That impression may have been a false one and to that extent the jury misled. The possible miscarriage of justice that resulted was such that leave should be granted under r4. I would uphold this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 1 and 2 
       
      
    35    Both these grounds concern the form of the directions given in relation to the complainant’s evidence being uncorroborated and the absence of complaint. They were said to suggest that the trial Judge may have held a view about the complainant’s evidence favourable to or sympathetic with the complainant and that it was only because obliged by law that the direction was given. It was a mere technicality.  
     
      
    36    If these directions are read in their context, I do not think the criticism is well founded. In the case of the first direction, the trial Judge immediately went on to say that the caution was that “you must approach her evidence with particular care and scrutinise it with great care because she is the only witness against the accused”. A little later he said “it makes perfectly good sense that you should be careful in the scrutiny you apply to that witness to make sure that that witness’s evidence does satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt”. The second direction was immediately followed by the statement: 
     
      
       
        
        “The first of those directions is that certainly if somebody does not complain, then that is obviously consistent with there being nothing to complain about. But I am also obliged to warn you in cases of sexual assault that there may be many reasons why a person does not complain either immediately or indeed at all. And the fact that they make no complaint does not prove that there was nothing to complain about”. 
        
       
      
    37    Quite appropriately the trial Judge impressed upon the jury that the directions were not given because of any view he had formed but because he was obliged by law to do so. I can see no impropriety in these directions taken either individually or together. In my opinion, leave to rely on these grounds of appeal should be refused. Compare R v Zammit (1999) NSWCCA 65 at para 79-82. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 
       
      
    38    The appellant submitted that this Court should conclude that, upon the whole of the evidence, it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty. Reference was made to the joint judgment of Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 450-451 where their Honours referred to the decision of the High Court in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 and went on to say that the majority in that case emphasised that it was not the function of the Court to answer that question merely by examining the transcript of evidence and the exhibits. The majority in M at 493 said that: 
     
      
       
        
        “in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.” 
        
       
      
    39    However, the majority went on to explain the test as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.” 
        
       
      
    40    In Jones at 452 Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “..the test formulated by the majority in  
        M 
         must now be accepted as the appropriate test for determining whether a verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory.” 
        
       
      
    41    In M v The Queen at 493 the majority of the Court quoted with approval a passage from the decision of the Court in Davies and Cody v The King (1937) 57 CLR 170 at 180 in which it was observed that a Court of Appeal will set aside a conviction whenever it appears unjust or unsafe to allow the verdict to stand “because there is some feature of the case raising a substantial possibility that, either in the conclusion itself, or in the manner in which it has been reached, the jury may have been mistaken or misled”. In M v The Queen at 504 Brennan J said that “it would be a mistake to regard any case in which there is a ‘substantial possibility that, either in the conclusion itself, or in the manner in which it has been reached, the jury may have been mistaken’ to be a case calling for the quashing of a conviction.” For present purposes it is sufficient to point to the consequence of the jury being misled.  
     
      
    42    The appellant relied upon discrepancies in the complainant’s evidence. In her evidence in chief, the complainant was taken back to Christmas time “after you were in Mr Ford’s class”. The complainant said that when she was in Year 2, being the year in which the offences were committed, she had two teachers, Mr Ford and Miss Dakin. She gave evidence that in March 1997 she was in Miss Dakin’s class. In cross-examination, she said that her first teacher in Year 2 was Mr Ford in class 2F. Miss Dakin’s class was 2D. However, she said the offence occurred on a school day when she was in Miss Dakin’s class. 
     
      
    43    There was evidence that her brother B’s date of birth was 30 March 1997. She could not remember whether or not her younger brother had been born. She could not remember if she had been in Miss Dakin’s class before or after Easter. The Easter holiday commenced on Good Friday, 28 March. She remembered the day on which the appellant and his family moved from Dubbo. She agreed the matter she complained of happened before the move. She could not remember if her brother had been born at this point. Initially she denied that she had been present at the removal truck and could not remember if on the day of the alleged assault she had been in the water. She later conceded when shown a photograph that it showed herself and her siblings at the removal truck with the appellant and others on the day he moved from Dubbo. She could not remember if the appellant had been present before her parents left the house on the day she was assaulted. She could not remember if he had been outside at any point of time. She agreed that her eldest sister, then aged eight, another sister aged six and a brother aged three were playing outside. She could not remember if the appellant had checked on the other children and could not remember if he had remained when her parents returned home. The assault was alleged to have taken place in the main bedroom from which the complainant said one could see through the front window which had its curtains tied back to permit in air and light. At no point during the alleged assaults did the appellant make any effort either to check as to the whereabouts of the other siblings or secure himself from view or unwelcome entry through the door which was left open.  
     
      
    44    The complainant was cross-examined about evidence she had given at an aborted trial which began on 22 October 1999. At that trial she gave evidence that the appellant had pulled her swimming costume down and they were described by her as “still on me somewhere”. This was inconsistent with her evidence in the present trial where she could not say whether the costume was on or off. The complainant did not dispute the inconsistency but said that her memory was better on the occasion of the first trial. In cross-examination she said that she now remembered that the costume was still on her somewhere. She was asked: “That’s because you said it last time is that right?” and she answered “Yes”.  
     
      
    45    In chief the complainant said that the appellant had told her to close her eyes and that later she opened them and “saw his private”. Her statement to the police in this regard was quoted to her. In that the complainant told the police that the appellant pulled his own pants down and that she “didn’t see his private”. The reason given for this was “cause I didn’t to”.  
     
      
    46    The appellant submitted that there was conflict between this earlier account and the version asserted in chief that the complainant had seen the appellant’s genitals when he pulled down his pants. The complainant gave evidence of the appellant pulling down his tracksuit pants and then being told “to close me eyes”. She was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Yes, and did you close your eyes? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what happened after you closed your eyes? A. I seen his private.” 
        
       
       
      In cross-examination, she was asked: 
       
       
        
        “Q. And after he pulled your costumes down he pulled his tracksuit trousers down, is that right? A. Yes 
        
       
       
        
        Q. After he pulled his tracksuit trousers down did he then ask you to close your eyes? A. Can you please repeat that? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Right. After Big Russell asked, took his tracksuit trousers down did he ask you to close your eyes? A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was the next thing that happened after he took his tracksuit trousers down? A. (No verbal reply).” 
        
       
      
    47    In her evidence in chief, the complainant gave an account of the appellant first licking her vagina and “after he licked your private”, “he put his private into my private”. She said that he was moving up and down during this act. She was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did Uncle Russ do anything else to you that day? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What else did he do? A. He put his finger into my private.” 
        
       
      
    48    The complainant conceded that her statement to the police was inconsistent with her evidence in chief and cross-examination wherein she had asserted that the appellant was lying on top of her “only when he put his private in [her] private”. In her statement, the appellant had said the appellant climbed on top of her before he commenced licking her vagina which was the first in a sequence of three acts. The complainant asserted that, notwithstanding the conflict with the statement given to the police, her version of events at trial was correct. When cross-examined on the matter, she replied that she did not know for how long the appellant had inserted his finger. When pressed, the complainant said that she could not remember if the appellant had lain right on top of her nor could she remember the position of her legs, apart from saying that they were apart in answer to the question “Do you know if your legs were together or apart when he lay on top of you?”. As to the duration of the act of penile-vaginal intercourse, the complainant said that this had been “a short time” although she agreed that on 22 October she had said that she could not remember whether this had been a short time or a long time. She could not remember the degree of penetration and said she had not seen the appellant’s private inside her private. The complainant was cross-examined about an apparent inconsistency between evidence given on 22 October where she had said in relation to her costume “he pulled them up”, whereas in chief in the present trial, she had asserted that she herself had pulled up her swimming costume. The complainant finally asserted that the appellant was still in Dubbo when her brother B was born on 30 March 1997. 
     
      
    49    In the defence case, the appellant availed himself of a partial alibi in the shape of details pertaining both to his moving from Dubbo to Gilgandra and related preparations for the move which coincided with a court commitment by his son in Gilgandra. The appellant gave evidence that his five brothers and three sisters lived in Gilgandra. He visited Gilgandra for the purpose of accompanying his son to court on 12 February 1999. On this occasion, he stayed for a week with his niece, Miss Sally Anne Carr. Thereafter he stayed a further week with his sister-in-law, Mrs Fuller. Whilst in Gilgandra, he made arrangements to rent a house so that he could be near his son “because of the problems he was having at Gilgandra”.  
     
      
    50    The appellant’s father lived in Gilgandra and was in poor health. This was cited as another reason why the appellant considered it desirable to move. After spending the last week in Gilgandra with his sister-in-law, the appellant made arrangements with Mr and Mrs Jackson to rent a house in Hunter Avenue, Gilgandra. The house and grounds were in need of a substantial amount of tidying up and, on agreeing to attend to this, the appellant was forgiven a week’s rent. He returned to Dubbo and made arrangements with Mr Gus Semmler, a friend, to move his furniture. Tendered on the appellant’s behalf was a document indicating the payment of rent for periods commencing on 9 March 1997. The appellant identified the photograph earlier shown to the complainant as one of himself, the complainant and others gathered about the removal truck on the day that he had arranged to have furniture removed from his Dubbo home to Gilgandra. He said that after the furniture left on the truck, he returned the children to their home and then stayed overnight at the home of his sister-in-law, Miss Elizabeth Carr and her partner Mr Maurice Wright. The following day, he went to Gilgandra. 
     
      
    51    In cross-examination, the appellant conceded he had earlier given evidence in an unrelated matter on 31 August to the effect that he had been in Dubbo for three or four days after the furniture had left on the removal truck. This account was agreed to be “probably correct”, although the appellant said that “I would have left about two or three days later”. The effect of evidence called from his sister-in-law Mrs Fuller, his sister, Mrs Fay Kearney and niece, Miss Sally Anne Carr, was to confirm that for some weeks in February 1997, the appellant had stayed with each of them in Gilgandra. The window of opportunity for the commission of the alleged offence was thereby substantially narrowed. 
     
      
    52    The appellant relied upon the age of the complainant, the absence of corroboration of the complainant’s evidence and the inherent unlikelihood of the complainant’s account. A single occasion was relied upon. There was no suggestion of dis-inhibition from alcohol or any other explanation. The appellant was alleged to have launched into a series of quite unexpected sexual acts upon the complainant. At the time the complainant’s three siblings were nearby and free to wander about the house, including through the back door. The curtains of the main bedroom where the alleged attacks took place were drawn apart, giving a view both in and out of the window. The appellant was not said to have taken any precaution either to secure the door or the window or to ensure that he would not be interrupted. 
     
      
    53    The appellant submitted that the assertions by the complainant that she had been threatened to remain silent by reference to harm which could befall her mother and as yet unborn brother were inherently unbelievable. It was submitted that the Crown’s argument that the name “B” was used as a transposition of a known detail into recounting a past event should not be accepted.  
     
      
    54    In the course of her evidence, the complainant in answer to a question “When these things happened to you on this day, was [B] already born?” she said “Can’t remember”. Later in her evidence, she was asked and answered: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did these things happen that you say happened in the bedroom did they happen before [B] was born? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
      Shortly afterwards the complainant was asked what the appellant said to her. 
       
        
        “What did he say? A. He said ‘Don’t tell your mum or I’ll kill your mum and [B]’. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is that what he said? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he say [B’s] name? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You sure about that? A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    55    The appellant submitted that there was plainly no misunderstanding on the part of the complainant and that her evidence in this regard could not be accepted as anything other than untrue. Although it would be completely understandable for an eight year old, having had a brother born and subsequently named, retrospectively to substitute the name of her brother for the unborn baby, in this case, at first, she was not sure whether the baby was born or not but later she was definite that it occurred before [B] was born. In the absence of any evidence of pre-knowledge of the gender of the baby and what the baby’s name was to be, her evidence is more consistent with construction or reconstruction of the event afterwards. This raises concern about the reliability of her evidence. 
     
      
    56    Overall the appellant submitted that the complainant’s evidence was not of a sufficient and compelling pattern of consistency and detail to remove a justifiable concern that her evidence was either in whole or in part not a truthful account of what passed between herself and the appellant. It was further submitted that there was a disturbing possibility that the evidence had about it “a veneer of truth because over a period of time there was a possibility that matters suffered not at the hands of the appellant but at the hands of another attacker had been confused with or substituted for the truth”. 
     
      
    57    As I have indicated, in my opinion, the danger of the jury proceeding on a false basis as a result of the direction given about the capacities of a child of the complainant’s age mean that the verdict must be quashed. There is undoubtedly a level of inconsistency in the complainant’s evidence but the jury saw and heard her give it. I would regard these inconsistencies as peripheral. If they stood alone, it still remained open to the jury to be persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the acts of sexual abuse the complainant had alleged had occurred; see R v McKnoulty (1995) 77 A CrimR 333 at 338-9; R v RMM (1996) NSWCCA Butterworths Unreported Decisions at 8 and following. However, they must be viewed in the context that on another occasion before the trial the complainant was sexually abused. As I have said, the extent and nature of that sexual abuse is unknown and will not be known to the jury if there is a new trial. This element of unreliability in the complainant’s evidence adds to the significance of the inconsistencies in her evidence. In my opinion, the conduct of the trial resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Any new trial would involve a further miscarriage of justice. The verdict should be quashed. The appellant is entitled to a verdict of acquittal. 
     
      
       
      ORDERS 
       
      
    58    In my opinion, the following orders should be made: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Appeal allowed; 
        
       
       
        
        2. Quash the conviction; 
        
       
       
        
        3. Substitute a verdict of acquittal. 
        
       
      
    59    JAMES J:  I agree with the judgment of Sheller JA. 
     
      
    60    DOWD J: I have seen the reasons for judgment of Sheller JA. I concur with the proposed orders, and with those reasons.

    19    The Crown case may be summarised as follows:- 
     
      
       
      Count 1: 
       
      
    20    On 23 June 1997, ASF and her brother, WSF, were at home sick. ASF was then aged 7 years and WSF was aged 10 years. 
     
      
    21    ASF answered a telephone call from the appellant who asked questions about the family names and details. The phone conversation extended over a period described by the complainant as seeming like a long time. 
     
      
    22    The appellant said that he would give the complainant and her brother $4,000 each year commencing from the previous year, 1996, to enable them both to attend university and that he would ""… make us both doctors"". The complainant gave evidence that at one stage during the telephone conversation, ""He [the appellant] said to take a banana and stick it up my vagina"". 
     
      
       
      Count 2: 
       
      
    23    WSF gave evidence of the telephone call answered by his sister, ASF, on 23 June 1997. He corroborated her evidence of being on the telephone for a long time. WSF spoke to the appellant who told him that he and his sister had been awarded something for school. 
     
      
    24    The appellant asked the complainant if he thought his sister was pretty and also asked WSF to touch his sister on the vagina. 
     
      
    25    WSF gave evidence corroborating a number of the matters of which his sister, ASF, had given evidence as forming part of her conversation with the appellant, including her having asked him (WSF) if they had a banana in the house, to which he had responded in the negative. 
     
      
    26    During his telephone conversation with the appellant, WSF was informed by the appellant, who had introduced himself as Mr O'Brien, that he and his sister had been awarded $4,000 so they could become doctors. 
     
      
    27    The appellant told WSF to kiss his sister and to tell her to touch him on the penis. The appellant also told WSF to kiss and suck his sister's tongue, to rub her vagina and to tell her to rub his penis. 
     
      
       
      Count 3: 
       
      
    28    On 23 June 1997, KP, who was then 18 years of age, had some minor surgery which required her to have a week off school. On 25 June 1997, she was asleep in her bed when her mother came into her bedroom and gave her the telephone. She said that the appellant introduced himself as Dr Ryan. He told her that he was ringing in regard to winning a scholarship to study medicine at Sydney University and that she had won the scholarship because of her personality and not as a result of her academic abilities. He said that she would be receiving $40,000 for each year she studied. 
     
      
    29    The appellant made inquiries about other members of the complainant's family and, among other things, said, ""While you're talking to me I'd like you to stick your forefinger between your legs and reach a climax"". 
     
      
    30    The appellant then made a number of suggestions to the complainant about undressing her younger sister and performing sexual acts upon her and also upon the complainant's mother. 
     
      
    31    The appellant asked the complainant, ""Have you ever seen a man cum (sic)"" and upon answering in the negative said ""next time you're in that situation you should suck on the penis cause it's good for you"". 
     
      
       
      Counts 4, 5 and 6: 
       
      
    32    The material upon which these Counts were based is contained within Exhibit A2, being a transcript of a telephone conversation recorded between JS and the appellant on 6 July 1997. 
     
      
    33    At that time, JS was 7 years of age. She answered a telephone call from the appellant who identified himself as Dr Ryan from the Education Department. 
     
      
    34    The appellant asked a number of questions of the complainant and then told her that her teachers at school had recommended her for a special scholarship under which she would receive $40,000 every year until she finished high school. He told her also that she was to be put through university to study medicine and become a doctor. The appellant, during the course of further conversation, told the complainant to put her right hand inside her underwear and slide it down the front of her vagina and rub it up and down hard. He told her to keep doing this whilst they were talking. 
     
      
    35    The appellant then engaged in what might be described as the active coaching of the complainant in acts of masturbation. This is the conduct giving rise to Count 4. 
     
      
    36    The appellant asked the complainant if she had seen her mother and father making love and kissing, and described to her acts of cunnilingus and fellatio between her parents. The appellant then described acts of sexual intimacy which might be conducted between the complainant and her father and the complainant and himself, including, in both instances, acts of fellatio. These conversations are the basis of Count 5. 
     
      
    37    The appellant then turned his conversation with the complainant to acts of sexual intimacy with the complainant's mother, including the performance by the complainant of acts of cunnilingus with her mother. These conversations are the basis of Count 6. 
     
      
       
      Count 8: 
       
      
    38    This Count also relies on the tape of a telephone conversation. The appellant introduced himself as Dr Ryan from the Education Department and informed the complainant, WL, who was then 7 years of age, that she was to receive a scholarship from the Government, to the value of $40,000, so that she could become a doctor. 
     
      
    39    Following a conversation with the complainant, concerning her mother and herself carrying out certain sexual intimacies, the appellant told the complainant to put her hand inside her underpants and inside her ""rude part"" and to rub herself up and down.  
     
      
    40    The appellant asked the complainant, ""Have you seen daddy's dick?"" and further asked, ""Does daddy's dick stick up or stick down"". The appellant then said ""… if you rub mine"", ""If you touch it and rub it, it will stick up"", ""It gets stiff and hard so you can rub it"". 
     
      
       
      Count 9: 
       
      
    41    This Count relies also on the tape of a telephone conversation, once again, the appellant introducing himself as Dr Ryan from the Education Department and informing the complainant, JT, who was then 9 years of age, that she had been chosen to receive a scholarship of $40,000 to put her through school and university to become a doctor. 
     
      
    42    Following a conversation relating to the complainant's ""rude parts"" and her mother's ""rude parts"", the appellant asked the complainant to put her hand under her pants and slide it down to her vagina and to rub it up and down. 
     
      
    43    The appellant on this occasion also undertook what might be described as coaching the complainant to perform sexual intimacies upon her mother, including the act of cunnilingus. 
     
      
    44    Each Count in the indictment relates to a charge of incitement. It is common ground that incitement involves an intention to bring about a particular result or a reckless indifference as to whether that act occurs or not. See R v Massie (1998) 103 A Crim R 551, 557. Three of the counts left to the jury (Counts 1, 4 and 8) alleged incitement to an act of indecency “with” the appellant; one count (Count 3) alleged incitement to an act of indecency “towards” the appellant; and four counts (Counts 2, 5, 6 and 9) alleged incitement to an act of indecency “with” another person. 
     
      
    45    Grounds of Appeal 
     
      
      (1) The trial judge failed properly to direct the jury regarding the elements of the offences charged. 
       
      (2) The convictions were unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
       
      These grounds may be conveniently considered together. 
       
      
    46    The prosecution offered no explanation of the difference in language between Counts 1, 4 and 8 (which relate to incitement to acts of indecency “with” the appellant) and Count 3 (which relates to incitement to an act of indecency “towards” the appellant). As might be expected, there is a material distinction between the alternatives referred to in the statutory phrase “with or towards”. Broadly speaking, an act of indecency “with” another requires two participants in the indecent act, while an act of indecency “towards” another is committed by a person who acts indecently towards a non-participant. See R v Page NSWCCA, 25 November 1991; R v Orsis (1997) A Crim R 457. 
     
      
    47    Counts 1, 3 4, and 8 each alleged a telephone call in which, on the prosecution case, the appellant incited an auto-erotic act (if that description can be applied to the actions of 7 year old children who were the complainants for Counts 1, 4 and 8). Those acts could not be described as indecent acts “with” the appellant. It is unnecessary to decide whether the appellant’s suggestion to the 18 year old complainant for Count 3 that she engage in auto-erotic behaviour in the course of the telephone call which the appellant had made to her could constitute an indecent act “towards” him. Even if that is theoretically possible, the need for a careful direction to the jury is obvious. 
     
      
    48    The material parts of the summing-up were extremely brief. The jury were told that: 
     
      
      (a) the prosecution was required to prove that: 
       
       (i) the accused incited a person to commit an act of indecency; and 
       
       (ii) the act of indecency involved the accused or some other person; and 
       
      (b) “[t]he ordinary meaning of the word incite is to do some act intending to urge, suggest, or stimulate to action”. 
       cf  
      Young v Cassells 
       (1914) 33 NZLR 852, 854. 
       
       
      The trial judge did not elaborate. Further, no reference was made in the summing-up to recklessness, although that omission favoured the appellant. 
       
      
    49    The directions given to the jury were seriously deficient. Further, the combination of the deficiency and the brevity of the summing-up was prejudicial to the appellant. The jury could easily have considered that the appellant’s guilt was a necessary consequence if it was satisfied that the appellant made the statements attributed to him in the telephone conversations alleged. Some confirmation that the jury might have proceeded on that basis might be found in the appellant’s convictions on Counts 1, 4 and 8 on which he could not have been properly convicted on the evidence. 
     
      
    50    One other specific defect in the summing-up should be noted. There is a degree of ambiguity in the trial judge’s statement “that the ordinary meaning of the word incite is to do some act intending to urge, suggest or stimulate to action”. The point can be illustrated by reference to a suggestion relied upon as an incitement. The suggestion might be intentionally (i.e. deliberately) made without any intention that it be acted upon; for example, a suggestion intentionally made might be ironic or vulgar abuse. Before the appellant could be convicted, the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he intended the complainants to engage in the sexual activity which he suggested with the persons whom he identified (or was recklessly indifferent to whether or not they did so). 
     
      
    51    Counts 1, 4 and 8 involved an allegation that the appellant intended the 7 year old children to whom he spoke on the telephone to engage in acts of indecency with the appellant. However, he plainly did not intend that they should ever learn his identity. Counts 2, 5, 6 and 9 involved an allegation that the appellant intended that the children to whom he spoke engage in acts of indecency with the complainant’s sister (Count 2); the complaint’s father (Count 5); and the complainants’ mothers (Counts 6 and 9). While it might be theoretically possible that, even if the appellant did not expect the complaints to perform those acts of indecency, he intended them to do so, the brief directions given to the jury were insufficient to direct its attention to its proper task. It was not adequately explained to the jurors that, before they convicted the appellant, they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he intended his suggestions to the complainants to be acted upon. 
     
      
    52    Although no complaint as to the directions, as given, was made by trial counsel for the appellant and no other or further direction was sought, the proper directions in relation to the appellant’s intention were fundamental to a fair trial and the inadequate direction has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. That that is so is emphasised by our conclusion that, even if properly directed, the jury could not have correctly convicted the appellant on the evidence on Counts 1, 4 and 8 and possibly 3. 
     
      
    53    The sections under which the appellant was charged, s 61N and s 61O of the Crimes Act, proscribe both the commission of an act of indecency and the incitement to an act of indecency. The prosecution submitted, correctly, that the jury must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant made the statements attributed to him in the telephone calls which it was alleged that he had made. Accordingly, it was submitted by the prosecution that, if the Court proposed to uphold the appeal and quash the appellant’s convictions, it should exercise its power under s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to substitute for the verdicts found by the jury verdicts that the appellant was guilty of committing an act of indecency on each occasion when he made the statements in question in the course of the material telephone calls. 
     
      
    54    The jury was undoubtedly satisfied that the acts which the appellant described to the complainants would have constituted acts of indecency. However, it was not required to consider whether the statements made by the appellant constituted acts of indecency by him. That is a jury question. This Court cannot conclude that the jury “must have been satisfied of facts which proved the appellant guilty” of committing acts of indecency. Accordingly, the Court has no power under s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act to substitute the verdicts sought by the prosecution. Spies v R [2000] HCA 43. 
     
      
    55    The appeal should be allowed and the convictions quashed. Verdicts of acquittal should be entered on counts 1, 4 and 8. New trial directed on counts 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9. 
     
      
    56    In deciding whether the appellant should be retried on the other counts, the Director or Public Prosecutions will no doubt take into account the doubt which we feel about count 3, the undesirability of the children to whom the appellant made his disgusting remarks again having to give evidence, and the circumstance that the appellant has spent more than 16 months in custody. 
     
      
    57    The appellant also applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed. In the circumstances, it is unnecessary to express a concluded view on whether the sentences were manifestly excessive. While the appellant’s conduct was reprehensible, there was no personal confrontation, there was no physical interference by penetration or other physical contact, and there was no violation of trust or undue exercise of a position of authority. 
     
      
    58    The report of a psychiatrist, Dr Canaris, of 30 July 1999 speaks of the psychosexual problems from which the appellant suffers as well as his deep depression and need for treatment. The affidavit evidence from the appellant discloses the steps which he has taken and is taking in an effort to obtain treatment. His behaviour has not gone unpunished.  
     
      
    59    SMART AJ: The background and an outline of the facts are set out in the joint judgment of Fitzgerald JA and Ireland AJ. Counts 1, 4, 7 and 8 allege that the appellant (Michael Chonka) incited a seven year old child to an act of indecency with him. Count 3 alleges that the appellant incited an eighteen year old lady to an act of indecency towards him. Counts 5, 6 and 9 each allege that the appellant incited a nominated child under the age of ten years to an act of indecency with a nominated person. In two instances the nominated person was an adult and in one instance a child. Count 2 alleges that the appellant incited a 10 year old child to an act of indecency with his sister. The offences allegedly occurred between 23 June 1997 and 6 July 1997. 
     
      
    60    The modus operandi of the appellant was to telephone people (mostly children) whom he did not know, represent that he was a person of standing, engage them in conversation, elicit personal details and advise them that they were to receive substantial benefits, usually of an educational character. The tenor and tone of the conversation then gradually changed as he incited them to commit an act or acts of indecency. One example will suffice. JS, a seven year old girl was told that she was going to be put through University to study Medicine and become a doctor. The appellant’s manner and speech were authoritative. He introduced himself as Dr Ryan of the Education Department. JS was reminded Medicine was the study of the human body and told that all doctors study on their own body and the bodies of their family members and close friends. She was urged to keep her body beautiful and told that she had to rub her vagina for half an hour each day to circulate the blood. He urged her to slide her hand inside her panties and rub her hand up and down her vagina until it was very wet and she felt it explode. This was said to be healthy. She was told that the more explosion feelings she experienced the more beautiful her body became. The appellant kept urging her to continue rubbing. She was urged to look at her mother’s vagina and told not to worry as that was part of her home study to become a doctor. She was urged to keep rubbing and insert her finger into her vagina and to slide it in and out until it became wet and explosive. She was asked about witnessing her parents kissing and making love. She was told that she could look at her father’s penis now as she was going to become a doctor. She was told that she could rub his penis and make it stiff. It would stick up in the air and she could suck it and lick it. The appellant described committing acts of cunnilingus with her. The conversation continued with him giving instructions in similar vein and checking periodically as to the sexual experiences which she was having and urging her to have indecent sexual activity with others. 
     
      
    61    The charges were laid under sections 61N and 610(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 which provide: 
     
      
       
        
        “61N (1) Any person who commits an act of indecency with or towards a person under the age of 16 years, or incites a person under that age to an act of indecency with or towards that or another person, is liable to imprisonment for 2 years. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Any person who commits an act of indecency with or towards a person of the age of 16 years or above, or incites a person of the age of 16 years or above to an act of indecency with or towards that or another person, is liable to imprisonment for 18 months. 
        
       
       
        
        610… 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Any person who commits an act of indecency with or towards a person under the age of 10 years, or incites a person under that age to an act of indecency with or towards that or another person, is liable to imprisonment for 7 years.” 
        
       
       
      
    62    It is to be noted that all counts except count 3 refer to inciting the victim to commit an act of indecency with either the appellant or a nominated third person. Count 3 refers to inciting an act of indecency towards the appellant. 
     
      
       
      Three questions of law arise, namely, the meaning of the words “with or towards that or another person”, the correct directions when inciting is charged and whether the evidence is sufficient to support the convictions. 
       
       
      With or Towards 
       
      
    63    In Regina v Hall [1964] 1 QB 273 the Court of Criminal Appeal when considering a somewhat similar section held that the word “with” meant “directed towards” or “against”. In DPP v Burgess 1971 1 QB 432 the Court of Criminal Appeal held, when construing a corresponding section, that there was only one offence of committing an act of gross indecency involving a child and that one reads “with or towards a child” as a phrase “with or towards.” “The words ‘or towards’ may be said to be explaining the word ‘with’ ”. That view was shared by Hulme J in his dissenting judgment in Regina v Orsos (1997) 95 A Crim R 457 at 462-465. However, in Regina v Preece [1977] 1 QB 370 the Court of Appeal declined to follow Hall. That case was regarded as inconsistent with earlier authority. In Preece it was held that the offence required “the participation, the co-operation, of two men.” This was distinguished from the situation where one man commits an act of indecency in the presence of another intending that that person should watch him. The other person is disgusted and does not participate. The act of indecency was directed towards that other person. This is an illustration. I would not doubt that an act of indecency could be directed towards a person over the telephone or by other means not involving the act of indecency being carried out in the personal presence of the other person. This would apply even more strongly in the case of incitement to an act of indecency. 
     
      
    64    In Regina v Page, unreported NSW CCA 25 November 1991 Campbell J; with whom Gleeson CJ & Mahoney JA agreed, said at page p4: 
     
      
       
        
        “However in  
        Regina v Preece 
         (1977) 1 QB 370 the Court of Appeal expressly declined to follow  
        Hall 
         and it was held that the word “with”, in a section which is not relevantly different to the one being considered here, involved the participation of two people and that for the act of indecency merely to be directed “against” or “toward” a non participating person was not sufficient for it to be said that it was committed “with” him.” 
        
       
      
    65    The Court followed Preece. 
     
      
    66    In Orsos Grove J, with whom Priestley JA agreed, said at 460: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the light of the judgments in  
        Preece 
         and  
        Page 
         I consider that there is a distinction between ‘with’ and ‘towards’. To commit an act of indecency ‘with’ a person involves two participants whereas logically and grammatically one person may commit an act of indecency ‘towards’ another.” 
        
       
       
      
    67    Page and Orsos represent the law in New South Wales. 
     
      
    68    In respect of counts 1, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 the jury were told that the elements which the prosecution must prove “are firstly that the accused incited a person under the age of 10 years to commit an act of indecency (2) that the act of indecency involved the accused or some other person.” (SU 7). 
     
      
    69    The judge continued (SU 8): 
     
      
       
        
        “In respect of counts 2 and 3 the elements are the same except the prosecution alleges that the child WSF in relation to count 2 was 10 on 23 June 1997 and in respect of count 3 the elements are again the same but the prosecution must prove that KP was aged over 16 years on 25 June 1997 and there was clear evidence from documents and herself that she was 18 years on 25 June 1997.” 
        
       
       
      
    70    In summing up the judge drew no distinction between inciting a person to an act of indecency with the accused or another person and towards the accused or another person. Inciting a person to commit an act of indecency with the accused or another person does not involve the act being carried out but it does mean that when the incitement takes place that what is intended by the accused is that the person incited will commit the act of indecency either with the accused or some other person. 
     
      
    71    Although the directions given (and quoted above) could have better and more fully explained the position, the effect was to tell the jury that the Crown had to prove that the accused incited a person of the requisite age to commit an act of indecency and that that act involved the accused or some other person. In other words, the accused incited the child to commit an act of indecency with himself or another person as the case may be. In the context, the word “involved” conveys the meaning that the intended or incited act of indecency was with the accused or another person. The direction given was sufficient to bring home to the jury that the Crown had to prove that the accused incited a person of the specified age to an act of indecency with the accused or another person. 
     
      
    72    As to count 3 the judge did not explain in express terms what was involved in an act of indecency towards the accused or another person. What the judge said was this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Count 3 as I said involves [KP] and the allegation there is that in a phone call on 23 June the caller said I would like you to stick your forefinger between your legs and reach a climax. That is that the accused incited KP to an act of indecency with the accused …” (SU 7-8) 
        
       
       
        
        … in respect of count 3 the elements are again the same but the prosecution must prove that [KP] was aged over 16 years on 25 June 1997. 
        
       
       
      
    73    This takes us back again to the use of the phrase “involved the accused or some other person”. From the context of the Summing Up the jury would have understood that they had to be satisfied that the accused incited KP to an act of indecency with the accused. That covers an act of indecency towards the accused. This follows because “with” involves the participation of two persons and “towards” involves one person performing the act of indecency to another, that is towards another. KP was being incited to masturbate herself and reach a climax. The request came from the accused by telephone and the response was to him. The accused does not have to be physically present to see the response. Telephone and electronic methods of communication must be taken into account. With inciting, it is the urging to do the indecent act which is important and, as in the present case, the urging is to do it towards or for the accused. 
     
      
    74    In his closing address (T 264) counsel for the accused said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… where the word ‘with’ is used it has to be an act of indecency with him. There must be his participation in it. That he would have to be present for that to be carried out. There must be a suggestion that there be a meeting for that act of indecency to have been carried out. 
        
       
       
        
        Alternatively, that the word ‘towards’ would not involve him being actively involved but the act of indecency should be directed to him even though he might not actively be taking place, taking part.” 
        
       
       
       
      I do not accept that the accused had to be present in either case. There is no good reason why the participation should not be by telephone. This was a case in which the appellant gave detailed instructions as to the acts to be done, verified that they were being done and the results of those acts and achieved satisfaction and pleasure on hearing of what he regarded as the good results of the various sexual acts which he had urged upon the complainant. There was a sustained dialogue between the accused and the complainant. It was a step by step process. The acts of indecency which the various children were incited to commit were with the accused or with some other nominated person. In a number of instances the acts were carried out. 
       
       
      Incitement 
       
      
    75    It was pointed out in Regina v Asst Recorder of Kingston [1969] 2 QB 58 at 62 that the crime of incitement is a common law misdemeanour and that it matters not that no steps have been taken towards the commission of the substantive offence nor whether the incitement had any effect at all. It is merely the incitement which constitutes the offence. 
     
      
    76    As to the element of inciting the judge after telling the jury that they had to be satisfied that the accused incited a person under 10 years of age, under 16 years of age and over 16 years of age respectively said “The ordinary meaning of the word incite is to do some act intending to urge, suggest or stimulate to action.” 
     
      
    77    In Young v Cassells (1914) 33 NZLR 852 Stout CJ said “The word ‘incite’ means to rouse; to stimulate, to urge or spur on; to stir up; to animate’.” The Chief Justice called in aid the Oxford Dictionary. The Macquarie Dictionary defines “incite” as “to urge on, stimulate or prompt to action.” In R v Massie (1998) 103 A Crim R 551 at 564 Brooking JA, with whom Winneke P and Batt JA agreed said of “incite”, “common forms of behaviour covered by the word are: “command”, “request”, “propose”, “advise”, “encourage” or “authorise”. One can thus incite a crime by words or by acts which have any of these tendencies. 
     
      
    78    It was correctly common ground that the offence involved a mental element, namely, that the accused intended that his statements constituting the incitement be acted upon or that he was recklessly indifferent as to whether it occurred or not. See Glanville Williams, Criminal Law, The General Part, 2nd ed, 1961 at para 194; Smith & Hogan, Criminal Law, 7th ed 1992 at 268; Regina v Massie (1998) 103 A Crim R 551 at 557.2 (incite to murder) and R v Ay, unrep. NSWCCA 30 Oct 98 at 20-21 (Smart J), (the analogous case of solicit to murder). As the joint judgment herein points out no reference was made to recklessness in the summing-up and that favoured the accused. I doubt if recklessness applied or could have applied in the present case.  
     
      
    79    The Crown submitted that what the judge said as to the meaning of “inciting” while brief was sufficient. It was pointed out that the jury was required to find some act on the part of the accused by which he intended to urge or suggest or stimulate to action. The urging or suggesting was to take action as advocated by the appellant. The appellant contended that the direction was seriously deficient and that the jury would not have understood that the Crown had to prove that the appellant intended that the act of indecency be carried out by the person to whom he spoke. 
     
      
    80    While the direction given should have been clearer, the question is whether it was sufficient in the circumstances. It was, but barely so. The jury would have understood from the judge’s words “to do some act intending to … stimulate to action” that they had to be satisfied that the appellant in uttering the words used intended that the request, suggestion or instruction be implemented or carried out. 
     
      
    81    The judge was not asked to give any further direction as to the mental element. In his closing address (T 263) counsel for the accused said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown told you that the word incite means to encourage and gave some other words all to a like effect. The word incite, in this instance, is an ordinary word capable of being understood by you, as the jury, without the need to be a lengthy definition. 
        
       
       
        
        You must in your deliberations draw a distinction between simply talking about something and encouraging someone else to go and do it. They might be dirty phone calls, as it is sometimes said, but unless you find that there was a suggestion in the telephone calls to actually do something and that something was an act of indecency it can’t be an incitement.” 
        
       
       
       
      Counsel for the accused by his reference to the need to find a suggestion in the telephone calls to actually do an act of indecency conveyed to the jury that there has to be serious request which was intended to be acted upon. Counsel hearing the summing-up in the atmosphere of the trial must have thought that it conveyed the notion that the accused intended his instruction, request or suggestion to be carried out. 
       
      
    82    I turn now to the various counts. 
     
      
       
      Counts 4, 5 and 6 
       
       
      Counts 4, 5 and 6 arise out of the extended conversation between the appellant and JS on 6 July 1997. Count 4 relates to him telling her to place her right hand inside her panties, slide it down to the front of her vagina and rub it up and down hard. He urged her to continue as he checked whether it was getting wet and exploding and confirming that it was f - lovely and f - beautiful. These were the most explicit urgings and instructions. The transcript of the tape and the tape reveal the satisfaction and pleasure which the appellant was experiencing. The facts amply supported count 4, namely, that the appellant incited JS to an act of indecency with him. 
       
      
    83    Count 5 relates to the appellant’s telephone advice that she can rub her father’s penis up and down and make it stiff and hard. This follows immediately after the appellant had told JS of her father kissing her mother’s vagina, sucking it and licking it for her and her mother sucking her father’s penis. Following the words, the subject of the count, is a description by the appellant of what should be done, namely, sucking her father’s penis and a description of acts of cunnilingus with the appellant and her sucking his penis and an assertion of how good all of this would be. The Crown contended that when the whole of the conversation was taken into account there was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the appellant intended that the complainant, JS, rub her father’s penis. The appellant contended that there was insufficient evidence to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended that JS rub her father’s penis. The perversion, urgency and persistence revealed in the conversation was of such a high order that it was well open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant did so intend. It is the conclusion which I would draw. 
     
      
    84    Count 6 also related to the telephone conversation between JS and the appellant in which JS was told to open her mother’s vagina with her fingers, put her mouth right inside it and suck it and lick it. Reliance was placed not only on this particular instruction but the whole of the conversation. The appellant contended that there was insufficient evidence to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that he intended that JS carry out the actions mentioned. Having regard to the terms of the whole conversation I disagree. The facts support count 6, namely, that the appellant incited JS to an act of indecency with her mother. 
     
      
       
      Count 8 
       
      
    85    This count relates to the taped telephone conversation between the appellant and WL. After a series of questions and remarks about her mother’s vagina and her father’s penis and an instruction to put her hand inside her underpants and slide it up and down “the rude part” and confirming that it was beautiful he advocated that her mother perform cunnilingus upon WL. After advocating further sexual activity he said “you are rubbing my rude part, if you touch it and rub it it will stick up, it gets stiff and hard so you can rub it”. The words just quoted formed the subject of this count. The appellant submitted that there was simply no possibility of WL rubbing his penis that day or shortly thereafter. The conversation took place on the evening of 6 July 1997. WL, a seven year old girl, was at home with her parents. No arrangements were made to meet. The appellant’s home was searched from about 9.05 am on 8 July 1997 and he was arrested. The appellant contended that there was no evidence capable of satisfying a jury beyond reasonable doubt that he intended that WL rub his penis. What occurred was filthy talk but it fell short of incitement. The appellant received sexual gratification and pleasure from the dialogue directed by him. If the count had focussed on his incitement of her to rub her vagina and his responses there would have been a sustainable charge. On the issue litigated the appellant is entitled to succeed and to be acquitted on this count. I have not overlooked s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. For the reasons given in the joint judgment the Court cannot use the power conferred by that sub-section. The distinction between inciting to an indecent act and the uttering of the words being an indecent act is a fine one. In the circumstances of this case the result is a little unreal. 
     
      
       
      Count 9 
       
      
    86    This count related to the telephone conversation between the appellant and JT on 6 July 1997. Initially, the appellant advised her that home study of her body was permissible and desirable. The appellant described the aberrant sexual activity which took place between E (her girlfriend and E’s mother) and how she (JT) could participate in such activity. The sordid details need not be recounted. The appellant urged JT to place her hand inside her pants and rub her vagina. He then described E engaging in sexual activity with JT. The appellant instructed JT to kneel in front of her mother and lift up her mother’s dress and confirmed with JT that she was doing so. (JT’s mother came from Vietnam and had difficulty with the English language). The appellant instructed JT to pull down her mother’s panties and confirmed that this had happened. He then elicited a description of her mother’s private parts. The appellant urged JT to open her mother’s vagina and to rub it and confirmed with JT that she was doing so. The appellant elicited a further description from JT of the condition of the mother’s vagina and confirmed with JT that she was rubbing her mother’s vagina. It is against this background that the words to which this count applied must be considered. He instructed her, as to her mother’s vagina “Put your mouth on it sweetheart …. Keep the phone on your ear, suck it and lick it up and down. Suck it.” JT was instructed to slide her tongue up and down. He verified that she was sucking and that it tasted well. 
     
      
    87    The transcript of this taped telephone conversation extends over 49 pages and contains many urgings by the appellant to JT to engage in indecent acts, checking that the acts were taking place and giving pleasure to JT and her mother. It is evident from the terms of the conversation that the appellant was obtaining considerable pleasure and gratification. It was a case of the appellant inciting JT to an act of indecency with her mother. This count needed no elaborate or sophisticated directions. The tape and the transcript make the position clear. The appeal against conviction on this count must be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Count 2 
       
      
    88    This relates to a telephone conversation between the appellant and WSF on 23 June 1997. This was not taped. WSF had a poor recollection of the events but he was able to refresh his memory from a statement which he gave to the police on 25 June 1997. He deposed to his sister, ASF, talking at length on the telephone with the appellant who called himself Mr O’Brien. When WSF took over the telephone receiver from her “Mr O’Brien” spoke to him about the scholarships being awarded. WSF stated that “Mr O’Brien” told him to tell his sister to touch him on his penis. “Mr O’Brien” told him to kiss and suck his sister’s tongue. WSF did not do so and did not reply to “Mr O’Brien’s” question “Isn’t, that beautiful”? “Mr O’Brien” said “Rub her vagina”. WSF did not do so. WSF also gave evidence that “Mr O’Brien” asked him to touch his sister on her vagina. ASF gave evidence of the telephone call from the appellant and of being at home with her brother. The telephone records show that the telephone call to ASF and WSF lasted for about 1 hour 26 minutes. The evidence establishes that the appellant was urging WSF to commit an act of indecency with his sister. The facts were simple and the directions sufficient. 
     
      
       
      Count 1 
       
      
    89    This relates to the telephone conversation on 23 June 1997 between the appellant and ASF, the younger sister of WSF. He asked her a series of questions about herself and her family. She was unable to recall the terms of the lengthy conversation between them. She thought that he asked “What part of your mother’s body do you like the best.” She replied “the eyes”. She stated that he said to take a banana and stick it up her vagina. ASF thought that she replied that they didn’t have any bananas. WSF said that ASF asked him if there was a banana and that he replied “no”. 
     
      
    90    Because of the ages of ASF (aged seven) and WSF (aged ten) and their consequent incomplete recollections the evidence on this count is limited. Unfortunately, the conversation was not taped. The inquiry by ASF of her brother as to whether they had a banana suggests that she was taking the instruction seriously and not dismissing it. The count alleges that the appellant incited ASF to an act of indecency with him. There is no good reason why the inciting cannot take place over the telephone especially in an extended dialogue. It was the appellant who was to achieve pleasure and satisfaction from ASF carrying out the indecent act. Again, the facts were simple and the direction, although brief sufficient. 
     
      
       
      Count 3 
       
      
    91    This count relates to a telephone conversation between the appellant and KP aged eighteen years on 25 June 1997. The appellant introduced himself as Dr Ryan and spoke in a calm, professional and convincing manner. He told her of the scholarship which she had won to study medicine. He moved to the topic of the study of the human body. Having ascertained that KP was sitting on her bed, the appellant said to her “While you’re talking to me I’d like you to stick your forefinger between your legs and reach a climax.” These were the words relied upon as the basis of this count. Reliance was also placed on the context. She did not do as he directed. He inquired as to how many climaxes she had had and asserted that, if she was doing what he said, she should be pretty wet by now. He then advocated in some detail acts of indecency which she should commit with her sister and her mother. I will not repeat the details. KP resisted the appellant’s suggestions. He again returned to the number of climaxes she had reached and asserted that she should feel good. He next told her when she was next in a situation where a man “came” she should suck his penis as it was good for her. 
     
      
    92    The appellant intended KP to do what he said. He went to some lengths to persuade her and checked to see that she was obtaining favourable results from carrying out his instructions. It is not to the point that she did not carry out his instructions. As mentioned earlier, this is the count which alleges that the appellant incited KP to an act of indecency towards the appellant. The appellant by both his urging and his checking as to the results was a person for whom the acts were to be performed. He was to obtain sexual pleasure and gratification. The acts were to be performed towards the appellant. There was ample material to sustain the count and for the reasons earlier given the direction was sufficient. 
     
      
    93    If I am wrong in the view I have taken there should not be directed verdicts of acquittal but rather an order for a new trial. The offences are serious. It would be a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to ascertain and take into account the wishes of the children and the families. The course proposed of directed verdicts may leave them with a sense of injustice. I note that the children were not cross-examined at the first trial. The crux of the Crown case lies mainly in the tapes. 
     
      
       
      Appeal Against Sentence 
       
      
    94    The appellant by his various acts of incitement sought to lead some four young children (aged ten and under) to acts of indecency and down a path of sexual perversion. He used some cunning and deception in his efforts as I have earlier detailed. The offences were serious and questions of public and private deterrence loom large. Children must be protected from those who would seek to lead them to acts of indecency. The conviction on count 8 has been quashed. A head sentence in excess of 4 years is manifestly excessive as is a minimum term of 2 years 6 months. These remarks apply to counts 1, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9. I would not disturb the other sentences. I agree that there are special circumstances. 
     
      
    95    I propose that: 
     
      
       
      (a) The appeal against conviction on count 8 be allowed, the conviction and sentence quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered. 
       
       
      (b) The appeals against conviction on other counts be dismissed. 
       
       
      (c) Leave to appeal against the sentences be granted. 
       
       
      (d) The appeals against sentence on counts 2 and 3 be dismissed. 
       
       
      (e) The appeals against sentence on counts 1, 4, 5, 6 and 9 be allowed. 
       
       
      ( 
      f) In lieu of the sentence imposed on count 1 the appellant be sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months starting on 5 August 1999. 
       
       
      (g) In lieu of the sentences imposed on counts 4, 5, 6 and 9 the appellant be sentenced to 4 years imprisonment starting on 5 August 1999 with a non-parole period of 2 years starting from that date and ending on 4 August 2001.

     JUDGMENT 
      
     
     
      
    1    THE COURT: On 14 July 2000 we granted leave to Anthony Vitasovic (“the applicant”) to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed on him on 15 October 1999 in the District Court at Penrith. We allowed the appeal and quashed the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge. In lieu thereof, we sentenced the appellant to a term of two years imprisonment with a non-parole period of twelve months. The sentence was expressed to commence on 15 October, 1999. The first date upon which the appellant will be eligible for release on parole is 14 October 2000. In accordance with s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 we directed the appellant’s release at the end of the non-parole period.  
     
      
    2    We now give our reasons for making those orders. 
     
      
    3    The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of “dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm” pursuant to s 52A(3) of the Crimes Act, 1900. This offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years. On 15 October 1999 he was sentenced to a minimum term of 22½ months imprisonment to commence on 15 October 1999 and to expire on 30 August 2001. An additional term of 7½ months to date from 31 August 2001 was specified. 
     
      
    4    At around 7.30 pm on Friday 14 March 1999 the applicant was driving a Daewoo sedan which had been lent to him by a firm of smash repairers as a courtesy car. He stopped at a service station located on Vardys Road, Marayong where he made a telephone call. It appears that he had some dispute with the person to whom he was speaking. After completing his call the applicant got into the Daewoo sedan and pulled out of the service station quickly. He travelled along Vardys Road in an easterly direction for approximately 800 metres before the point of collision. The gradient of the road from the service station as one drives east (towards the intersection with Valediction Road) involves a rise. At this time Mrs Tina Wilson was driving a Holden Camira sedan south on Valediction Road. At the intersection of Valediction and Vardys Roads she commenced to make a right hand turn. She had three children in her vehicle, including her daughter Natalee, who was then aged eleven. Natalee was seated in the rear passenger seat on the driver’s side. Mrs Wilson paused at the intersection looking to her left and right to ensure that the intersection was clear of traffic. Very shortly thereafter the Daewoo sedan driven by the applicant came over the crest at a speed which was assessed at 90 kilometres per hour. At this time Mrs Wilson’s vehicle was within the confines of the intersection. The applicant applied the brakes on the Daewoo sedan abruptly causing the wheels to lock up and the vehicle to skid on the dry bitumen road for a distance which was estimated to be 33 metres. The two vehicles collided. There was severe impact damage and the child, Natalee, sustained significant injuries which required her admission to the intensive care unit at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children.  
     
      
    5    Natalee suffered severe diffuse brain injury, facial lacerations, a fractured femur, a fractured pelvis and abdominal injuries. She underwent surgery and there followed a period of prolonged intensive care and rehabilitation. The sentencing judge quoted the report of Dr O’Flaherty, staff specialist in rehabilitation at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, of 23 March 1999 : 
     
      
       
        
        “It is now two years since Natalee’s traumatic brain injury and whilst some improvement is expected, it is very likely that she will remain with a severe degree of cognitive including behavioural impairment.” 
         
        
       
      
    6    The applicant presented a strong subjective case on sentence. He was a twenty seven year old man with no criminal record and an impressive employment history. His parents are Croatian. They were living in Sydney at the time of the applicant’s birth. While he was still a baby they decided to return to their homeland. Life did not prove easy for the family in Croatia and they returned to Australia when the applicant was aged fifteen. The applicant’s schooling was disrupted by the move. He left school and commenced full-time employment around the age of sixteen. Thereafter he was in regular employment until the date of his sentencing. He had worked both as a labourer and a plasterer. In the three years prior to his sentencing, he had been employed by a firm named “City Rendering” as a plasterer. Throughout his working life the applicant had been accustomed to working six days a week. 
     
      
    7    The applicant’s disrupted schooling and limited formal education had led him to feeling inadequate, particularly when in the company of women. His command of English is poor and he found it hard to express himself and often believed that he was misunderstood. Frustration over these difficulties led to him experiencing pronounced feelings of anger. He discussed these feelings with a friend, Monica Liebenow. She suggested that he consult Dr Ivor Zetler. The applicant took Ms Liebenow’s advice and first saw Dr Zetler on 31 January 1997, more than two months before the accident. 
     
      
    8    A report from Dr Zetler was tendered on the applicant’s behalf at the sentence hearing. In that report Dr Zetler set out his observations of the applicant over a series of consultations in the period between 31 January 1997 and March of 1997. At the initial consultation the applicant presented with feelings of anger and discomfort and embarrassment arising out of his poor command of English. Over succeeding sessions Dr Zetler observed that the applicant was becoming more relaxed. On 6 February 1997 Dr Zetler suggested that the applicant attend a course designed to foster self-esteem. The applicant returned a month later having enrolled in such a course. 
     
      
    9    On 17 March 1997 the applicant came to see Dr Zetler telling him of his involvement in the motor vehicle accident and complaining that he was unable to sleep. The applicant told Dr Zetler that prior to the accident, he had been in a bit of a fight over the telephone with a friend and that he had felt a bit upset as he had driven off however the emotion he described was not said to have been exceptional. 
     
      
    10    At a consultation on 19 May Dr Zetler observed the applicant to be very upset. He said that he had heard that Natalee had suffered severe injuries, including brain damage. He reported that he had cried all weekend and that he was unable to sleep and unable to think of anything else. Subsequent consultations in 1997 and 1998 showed the applicant’s continuing concern over the injuries caused to the child. 
     
      
    11    Dr Zetler commented:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Vitasovic has had problems with control of his emotions in the past. His formative years have been marked by instability, insecurity and unhappiness. It is my opinion that considering his past, he has done well to be working full-time and making a contribution to society. … Anthony is essentially a good hearted, kind though shy person and I feel he has felt genuinely upset, remorseful and guilty about the consequences of the accident on the young child.” 
        
       
       
       
      
    12    The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing judge. His Honour accepted that the applicant was remorseful.  
     
      
    13    Therese Becker gave evidence on the applicant’s behalf at the sentence hearing. She described the applicant as feeling very sorry over the accident. She said: “he has the accident just in his head, he can see this happening in front of his eyes and he thinks about it” (p 14).  
     
      
      She went on to describe the applicant in these terms: 
       
       “I mean in my opinion is a very nice man, he’s very caring about me, about other people, like his friends and - yeah.” 
       
      
    14    The applicant’s father gave evidence confirming that the applicant was a hard worker and noting that he had always treated his parents with respect. 
     
      
    15    The applicant was first issued with a driver’s licence in New South Wales on 7 December 1990. On 7 March 1992 he was fined in respect of exceeding the speed limit by more than 30 kilometres, but not more than 45 kilometres, whilst driving a motor vehicle. A similar infringement was recorded on 31 December 1996. This was only three months prior to the subject offence. 
     
      
    16    A report by James Jaku, Probation and Parole Officer, stated:  
     
      
       
        
      “Mr Vitasovic expresses extreme remorse for his actions, fully accepting responsibility for his behaviour. … Mr Vitasovic impresses as a young man who has been seriously considering the gravity of his actions in relation to the offence”. 
       
      
    17    In the course of his reasons for sentence the learned judge observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “This was not a case of momentary inattention or anything remotely resembling momentary inattention, it was a sustained course of dangerous driving, albeit over a distance of less than one kilometre. It had consequences for the young victim that I think can only be fairly described as catastrophic. There is, in my view, clearly a need for a sentence in this case which reflects considerations of both general and specific deterrence.” 
        
       
       
      
    18    Mr Norrish QC (now Norrish DCJ) who appeared on behalf of the applicant, principally attacked the sentence upon the basis that his Honour erred in characterising this as a “sustained course of dangerous driving”. Mr Norrish also submitted that his Honour erred in concluding, having regard to the antecedent background of this applicant, that it was a case which called for an element of specific deterrence.  
     
      
    19    Mr Norrish accepted that this was not a case involving momentary inattention or misjudgment of the exceptional class which might attract consideration of a non-custodial sentence. However, he submitted that the sentencing judge must be taken to have erred in his assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. The overall sentence of 2½ years was, so Mr Norrish submitted, consistent with a view that his Honour concluded that the facts of this case established the presence in a material degree of one or more aggravating features identified by the Chief Justice in Regina v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 231B-C.  
     
      
    20    His Honour emphasised on more than one occasion that the facts of this case established this to be a very serious instance of dangerous driving. It is necessary to review the factual material in some detail in order to detail with the challenge which Mr Norrish advanced. 
     
      
    21    Vardys Road travels in an east-west direction. It is an arterial road. There are two marked lanes for traffic heading in either direction. Aerial photographs suggest that the area surrounding the intersection of Vardys Road and Valediction Road is an industrial area. It is difficult to discern the gradient of Vardys Road as it approaches the intersection with Valediction Road from viewing the photographs. We were informed that there are no warning signs to indicate that the motorist is approaching an intersection. It would appear that although the section of Vardys Road, upon which the applicant was travelling, is subject to a 60 kilometre per hour speed limit, the flow of traffic was generally travelling well in excess of that speed. 
     
      
    22    Brendan Woodham was travelling on his motorbike on Vardys Road towards Blacktown and saw the applicant’s Daewoo sedan pull quickly out of the service station exit onto Vardys Road. The applicant pulled out in front of Mr Woodham. Mr Woodham told police:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I was riding slightly below 60 kilometres per hour, the white car was pulling away from me, not excessively quickly. There was other traffic going along Vardys quicker than me but the white car was going the quickest of the lot of them.” (The reference to the white car is a reference to the Daewoo sedan driven by the applicant). 
        
       
       
       
      
    23    Paul Clements was driving his car east on Vardys Road towards the intersection with Valediction Road. He was travelling in the lane closest to the median strip. He observed a small white car overtake his vehicle at what he described as “very high speed” on the passenger side. At the time Mr Clements was travelling at a speed of about 80 kilometres per hour. He checked his speedo. The small white car was pulling away from his car at high speed. Mr Clements saw Mrs Wilson’s white Holden in the process of making a turn. The Holden was already in the intersection as his car came over the crest towards the intersection. It was Mr Clements’ observation that the driver of the small white car was going too fast to stop.  
     
      
    24    Mr Clements’ wife, Karen, was seated in the front passenger seat of their vehicle. As they approached the intersection with Valediction Road she recalled thinking that the white Holden had plenty of time to make the turn before “we were on her”. It was at this time that she became aware of the small white car coming up behind their vehicle travelling in the lane to the left of their vehicle. The white car drove past and hit the white Holden driven by Mrs Wilson.  
     
      
    25    As we have noted, the agreed facts were that the applicant’s vehicle was travelling at approximately 90 kilometres per hour as it travelled over the crest on Vardys Road and approached the intersection. 
     
      
    26    In Jurisic the Chief Justice referred to the list of mitigating and aggravating factors identified by Lord Lane CJ in R v Boswell (1984) 3 All ER 353 and observed that these same considerations had been reflected in the judgments of this court. It was the presence or absence of the various mitigating and aggravating factors and their degree which would determine the appropriate penalty. The Chief Justice went on to list the following factors: 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted;  
         
        (ii) number of people put at risk; 
         
        (iii) degree of speed; 
         
        (iv) degree of intoxication or of substance abuse; 
         
        (v) erratic driving; 
         
        (vi) competitive driving or showing off; 
        
       
      (vii) length of the journey during which others were exposed to  
       
        
        risk 
        ; 
         
        (viii) ignoring of warnings; 
         
        (ix) escaping police pursuit.” 
        
       
       
       
      
    27    After observing that a number of these factors were reflected in the definition of “circumstances of aggravation” for the purposes of s 52A(7) of the Crimes Act, the Chief Justice continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Paragraph (i) and paragraph (ii) focus on the occurrence; whereas paragraphs (iii) - (ix) refer to the conduct of the offender. The presence of these latter factors may indicate that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct. When the presence of such a factor can be so described, then it can be said to be present to a material degree for the purpose of determining an appropriate sentence (231D).” 
        
       
       
        
        …. 
        
       
       
        
        “In my opinion this court should promulgate the following guidelines: 
        
       
       
        
        (1) a non-custodial sentence for an offence against s 52A should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or misjudgment; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) with a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of less than three years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death) and less than two years (in the case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm) should be exceptional. 
        
       
       
        
        I realise that the formulation I propose - does the relevant aggravating factor manifest, in the circumstances of the case, that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her conduct - introduces an element of judgment on which reasonable minds may differ. Nevertheless the formulation of the issue in such a way will serve the objective consistency of sentencing with respect to conduct that the community has indicated plainly that it wishes to deter and condemn”. (231E) 
        
       
       
       
      
    28    In the instant case Mr Norrish submitted that there was not “to a material degree any aggravating factor” other than the issue of speed. The evidence of speeding was said to be not such as to reflect an abandonment of responsibility for his conduct. There was absent in the instant case features such as alcohol, erratic driving, competitive driving or showing off, lengthy distance of driving in breach of the provisions of the Motor Traffic Act, the ignoring of warnings or escaping of police pursuit. Mr Norrish conceded that the driving reflected a longer than “momentary” lapse, but submitted that it reflected a “reckless error of judgment” in the circumstances of speeding towards the crest of a hill, rather than a considered course of dangerous driving. When one took into account the circumstance that the applicant was of good character, that he pleaded guilty and exhibited genuine remorse (in a case not occasioned by the fact that the victim was a close relative or friend) and that, despite the two prior speeding matters, his driving record was generally a good one then, even allowing for the flexibility to be applied in considering the “guideline” a sentence of 2½ years fell outside the permissible range. 
     
      
    29    We did not find this challenge an easy one to determine. As the Chief Justice observed in Jurisic consideration of whether the relevant aggravating factor manifests, in the circumstances of the case, an abandonment of responsibility for the driver’s conduct involves an element of judgment upon which reasonable minds may differ. Further, as the Chief Justice explained in Regina v Mansour [1999] NSWCCA 180 two of the aggravating factors set out in Jurisic take up objective considerations in respect of which no question of abandonment of responsibility arises. Of those two objective factors the first in the instant case (the extent and nature of the injuries inflicted) is significant in the circumstances of this case. As the sentencing judge noted the injuries suffered by Natalee were catastrophic. Notwithstanding this consideration, which serves to explain his Honour’s view that this was a most serious case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm, we were persuaded his Honour erred in characterising the applicant’s conduct as “a sustained course of dangerous driving”. This seemed to us, with respect, significantly to overstate the extent of the dangerous driving demonstrated by the evidence. The course of driving from the point of leaving the service station to the point of collision was a relatively short one. The applicant was speeding. It was this which made his manner of driving dangerous. It is this driving and the serious injuries which resulted that requires the imposition of a sentence of full time imprisonment. This is not a case in which it is suggested that the applicant’s speeding was associated with racing or weaving in and out of lanes of traffic or other erratic driving conduct. The road was a dual carriageway passing through an industrial area with the flow of traffic (notwithstanding the speed limit) apparently travelling safely at around 80 kilometres per hour, where the applicant had right of way. There is no basis for concluding (and the learned sentencing judge did not do so) that the applicant deliberately took the risk that, if another vehicle was placed such as Mrs Wilson’s, he would not have enough room to avoid a collision.  
     
      
    30    Having determined that error had been demonstrated it became necessary for us to consider the matter of sentence afresh. We were of the view that an appropriate sentence, bearing in mind the observations of this court in Jurisic, was one of 2 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    31    We then considered the question of special circumstances within the meaning of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Act”).  
     
      
    32    The applicant is a relatively young man who is facing his first gaol sentence. As a result of his somewhat disturbed early life he has psychological problems for which he had sought treatment prior to the commission of the offence. In his report Dr Zetler expressed some fears for the applicant’s safety and well being as a prisoner within the general prison stream (given an episode in the past of sexual abuse to which he had been subject). The experience of imprisonment upon a relatively young man of past good character with the vulnerability described in Dr Zetler’s report is likely to be particularly harsh. He has a creditable record of employment and is likely upon his release to make a productive contribution to the community. Inevitably he will require assistance in reintegrating into the community following imprisonment. We considered that these matters in combination constituted special circumstances justifying a departure from the proportion fixed by s 44(2) of the Act with respect to the length of the non-parole period.

     REGINA v Kenneth Ronald LEONARD 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
     
     
      
    1    The Court: On 14 July 2000 we made orders granting Kenneth Ronald Leonard (“the applicant”) leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court and allowing his appeal. We quashed the sentence and in lieu thereof we sentenced him to a term of four years imprisonment to date from 15 April 1999. We specified a non parole period of two years. We now give our reasons for making those orders. 
     
      
    2    The applicant was convicted of one count of robbery contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act 1900. His trial commenced in the District Court at Dubbo on 12 April, 1999. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on 15 April 1999. The following day the applicant was sentenced to a minimum term of three years penal servitude to date from 15 April 1999. That term was expressed to conclude on 14 April 2002. An additional term of twelve months to commence on 15 April 2002 was specified.  
     
      
    3    By Notice of Appeal dated 5 May 1999 the applicant appealed against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed upon him. By an undated notice received in the registry of the Court of Criminal Appeal on 10 April 2000 the applicant abandoned his appeal against conviction. He stated his intention to proceed with his application for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence. 
     
      
    4    The facts of the offence are briefly set out at the commencement of his Honour’s reasons for sentence; 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown case was that on 4 September 1996 an elderly lady Mrs Broome was walking towards her home in Coonamble. She was approached by the accused, he struggled with her and took her purse, about $80, a newspaper and groceries. At that time Mrs Broome was about 86 and photographs of her taken shortly after the incident depict a frail, elderly lady. She was too infirm to be brought to court.” 
        
       
       
       
      
    5    Upon the hearing of the application Mr Stratton, who appeared for the applicant, sought to lead additional evidence in the form of an affidavit sworn by his instructing solicitor who annexed a report prepared by Dr Hugh Jolly, psychiatrist, dated 16 June 2000. In the light of the contents of the report the Crown Prosecutor took no objection to the reception by the Court of this additional evidence. It is appropriate to return to this report after dealing with a number of other matters which were raised in the course of the hearing. 
     
      
    6    Mr Stratton developed several challenges to the correctness of the sentence imposed by the learned judge. A principal submission was that his Honour had failed to give sufficient weight to the principles applicable to the sentencing of Aboriginal offenders as explained in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. The applicant is an Aboriginal man. He was aged thirty six at the date of sentence. A pre-sentence report relating to another matter, dated 18 February 1998, was tendered in the applicant’s case before the sentencing judge. That showed that the applicant was assessed as having poor literacy skills and that he left school at the age of sixteen years. Thereafter he had only been in employment for a total of two years. He had significant problems with alcohol and associated psychiatric difficulties.  
     
      
    7    In the course of his reasons for sentence his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There are three factors advanced by the prisoner’s counsel. The first is the prisoner’s aboriginality. The principles to be applied are enunciated in Fernando’s case where the now Chief Judge at Common Law carefully identified the criteria for sentencing of indigenous people. His Honour cautioned against the Courts being patronising. Here is a case in which the prisoner from the information available lived within the town of Coonamble or Gulargambone in poor circumstances. He received a basic education, he does not seem to have been affected by the other tragic circumstances that are referred to in Justice Woods judgment. 
        
       
       
        
        His background was deprived in the sense that he may well have not realised his potential because of the social circumstances in which he was brought up. However none of the criteria in Fernando’s case are advanced by the prisoner’s counsel as being applicable. The offender’s aboriginality is a subjective factor that the court takes into account.” 
        
       
       
       
      
    8    It is to be noted that trial counsel did not seek to persuade the sentencing judge that the considerations addressed by Wood J (as he then was) in Fernando applied in the circumstances of the present case. Nonetheless Mr Stratton submitted that his Honour erred by failing to take into account the matters set out in paragraphs (E) and (G) at p 62 of the report: 
     
      
       
        
      (E) While drunkenness is not normally an excuse or mitigating factor, where the abuse of alcohol by the person standing for sentence reflects the socio-economic circumstances and environment in which the offender has grown up, that can and should be taken into account as a mitigating factor. This involves the realistic recognition by the court of the endemic presence of alcohol within Aboriginal communities, and the grave social difficulties faced by those communities where poor self image, absence of education and work opportunity and other demoralising factors have placed heavy stresses on them, reinforcing their resort to alcohol and compounding its worst effects. 
       
       
        
        (G) That in sentencing an Aborigine who has come from a deprived background or is otherwise disadvantaged by reason of social or economic factors or who has little experience of European ways, a lengthy term of imprisonment may be particularly, even unduly, harsh when served in an environment which is foreign to him and which is dominated by inmates and prison officers of European background with little understanding of his culture and society or his own personality. 
        
       
       
      
    9    Mr Stratton submitted that his Honour must be taken to have concluded that the principles enunciated in Fernando have no place save in the sentencing of Aboriginal persons living in remote communities. In the instant case the applicant had been raised in a reasonably isolated rural Aboriginal community where alcohol abuse was endemic. He came from a background involving the absence of work opportunity and education tending to reinforce the resort to alcohol to which Wood J had referred. 
     
      
    10    It is to be noted that there was no evidence that the assault upon Mrs Broome took place at a time when the applicant was affected by alcohol. We were informed by Mr Stratton, without demur from the Crown Prosecutor, that the evidence did disclose that the applicant had spent a portion of the day on which the offence was committed drinking at the river bank. 
     
      
    11    We did not consider that Mr Stratton made good his challenge based upon the decision in Fernando. The sentencing judge observed that there were what he characterised as “strong subjective factors in the case”. He went on to refer to the applicant’s aboriginality noting that he had lived in central western New South Wales all his life. He commented on the applicant’s school record and associated poor literacy skills and his lengthy period of unemployment. He noted that in 1998 the applicant had suffered a stroke attributed to his alcohol and cannabis use and that he had been on a disability support pension since that time. It is difficult to see how his Honour might have taken the applicant’s aboriginality into account as a strong subjective circumstance save by recognising that he belonged to a group recognised as subject to the entrenched social and economic difficulties to which Justice Wood referred in Fernando. 
     
      
    12    Mr Stratton next challenged the sentence upon the basis that it was manifestly excessive. We were referred to statistics prepared by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales (“the Commission”) for the period January 1990 to July 1999. Those showed that out of a sample of 647 offenders only eleven percent received a total sentence in excess of the four years imposed upon the applicant. When one refined the sample by including the following limiting criteria; (i) single count (ii) no matters on a Form 1 (iii) criminal record for offences of a different character & (iv) subject to a bond at the date of the offence, only one offender had received a longer sentence than the applicant and only two had received longer minimum terms.  
     
      
    13    Mr Stratton observed that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was within the range of sentences proposed by this court in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 for the offence of armed robbery. The guidelines promulgated in Henry, to which Mr Stratton referred, related to that category of case in which the offender is a young offender with little or no criminal history and in which, inter alia, the offender pleads guilty. 
     
      
    14    The applicant has a lengthy criminal history dating back to 1979. He is a man of mature years whose criminal record does not entitle him to any claim for leniency. There was no question of a discount for a plea of guilty in this case. We were not persuaded that there was utility in looking to the Henry guideline judgment as a basis for contending that a four year sentence for a serious offence of robbery was excessive. In dealing with the submission that the sentence is manifestly excessive, it is appropriate to have regard to the statutory maximum which is a sentence of fourteen years penal servitude (now imprisonment). It may also be appropriate to have regard to the pattern of sentencing for this offence revealed by the statistics maintained by the Commission; Regina v Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 734. The latter shows that the sentence imposed in the instant case was towards the top of the range. We did not consider that it could be characterised as manifestly excessive. Objectively, this was a most serious case of robbery involving a violent assault upon a frail eighty six year old lady. 
     
      
    15    The sentence was also challenged upon the basis that the judge had erred in law in failing to find special circumstances for the purposes of s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act, 1989. We did not think that the sentencing judge erred in the approach he took in this respect upon the material before him. The additional material contained in the report of Dr Jolly may well have led the sentencing judge to take a different view with respect to the question of special circumstances. So much was acknowledged by the Crown Prosecutor. 
     
      
    16    It is to be noted that in the pre-sentence report reference was made to the applicant as having suffered from a long term depressive illness in respect of which he had been prescribed anti-depressant medication. In 1995 a visiting psychiatrist at the Bathurst Correctional Centre had reported that the applicant exhibited suicidal tendencies. This report also referred to the applicant as suffering from depression. The only other material before the sentencing judge relating to the applicant’s mental state was a short report prepared by Mr Lyons, a mental health nurse with the Macquarie Area Health Service. In that report Mr Lyons said that he had twice seen the applicant (for depression and poor coping skills) at the Coonamble Health Centre. Mr Lyons went on to recommend a complete psychiatric and psychological assessment be undertaken with respect to the applicant. No such assessment was before the sentencing judge. This was a matter to which his Honour made specific reference towards the conclusion of his remarks on sentence. His Honour directed that the prisoner be psychiatrically assessed as soon as practicable. 
     
      
    17    The applicant was interviewed by Dr Hugh Jolly, forensic psychiatrist, on 7 June 2000. Dr Jolly noted that the applicant presented pleasantly and that he related warmly and co-operatively although he complained of poor memory. He was described as being a bit bemused and inarticulate during the course of his interview with the doctor. In the 1998 pre-sentence report there was a passing reference to the applicant’s report that he had earlier been assaulted while in gaol. In the course of the interview conducted by Dr Jolly, the applicant gave an account of a sexual assault committed upon him by three fellow prisoners when he was in custody in 1981. He would then have been around eighteen years of age. There is no need to recount such details of the assault as the applicant provided to Dr Jolly. It is sufficient to note that if it occurred as the applicant said (and Dr Jolly was disposed to believe him) it was a very ugly incident. In Dr Jolly’s opinion the applicant suffered chronic post traumatic stress disorder as the result of this assault. That condition had, in turn, played a substantial part in fuelling the applicant’s alcohol consumption and depression. Dr Jolly characterised the latter as a major co-morbid depression.  
     
      
    18    In the light of the additional evidence led on the hearing of this application we were of the view that the applicant had made good his submission that special circumstances within the meaning of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 had been made out. Principally the special circumstances derive from the applicant’s psychiatric condition for which he will require ongoing treatment. However we also considered that there was merit to Mr Stratton’s submission that the experience of incarceration will sit more harshly upon this applicant in the light of the assault to which he was subject during the earlier period of incarceration.  
     
      
    19    For these reasons we were of the opinion that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal be allowed.

     REGINA v. KEITH EDGAR PONT 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    3   GREG JAMES, J: The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals to this court against the asserted inadequacy of a sentence imposed upon the respondent in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney on a charge of larceny as a servant. The respondent had pleaded not guilty to the charge which is punishable by a maximum of 10 years imprisonment but had been found guilty by a jury. 
    4   The respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for three years, to be served by way of periodic detention. That sentence was to date from 19 November 1999. Although the appeal had been commenced by lodgment of a notice of appeal on or about 20 December 1999, it was not brought on for hearing before us until 7 August 2000. By that time, the respondent had served a little under one-third of the sentence. 
    5   The sentence passed was the longest that the law permits to be the subject of an order that it be served by way of periodic detention (Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s.6). 
    6   The notice of appeal asserts as the ground of appeal that the sentence ""is inadequate"". By this ground, I understand that it is intended to assert ""error in point of principle"" (see per Barwick, CJ. in Griffiths v. The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293 at 310) as would amount to ""the kind of manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing standards"" (Everett v. The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 300 and Regina v. Barbara  (CCA, unreported 24 February 1997)) as would warrant the exercise of the exceptional power vested in the Director by s.5D by appealing to invoke the court's function to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of sentencing courts in such circumstances as applied in this case (Griffiths (supra) at 310). That kind of error would be found in the course taken by the primary judge in consequence of such findings of fact as were properly open and made. The appeal does not call for any re-hearing to re-determine findings open on the facts: Histollo Pty. Limited v. Director-General of National Parks & Wildlife Service (CCA, unreported 10 December 1998). The appeal is against the exercise of a discretion which recognises that a range of sentences might be appropriate in any case and that judges might legitimately differ in philosophy, approach and result: see Spigelman, CJ. in Regina v. Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and Kirby, P. in Regina v. Hayes (1987) 29 A. Crim. R. 452.  
    7   I understand the ground to assert not merely that there has been disclosed some error of principle such that the sentencing discretion has been improperly exercised even though that error might not be able to be identified (see Cranssen v. The King (1936) 55 CLR 509 at 519-520), but that the error contended for is such as to show that the sentence in its duration or nature is so far outside the permissible range of the exercise of a proper discretion as to require the intervention by this court, at least in the absence of matters going to the exercise of the court's well known discretion to refrain from intervening (see, eg., Regina v. Morrow [1999] NSWCCA 64; Regina v. Holder (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 225-226; Hayes (supra); Regina v. Allpass (1994) 72 A. Crim. R. 561; Regina v. Haughton [2000] NSWCCA 62; Regina v. Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2). 
    8   On an appeal such as this, the court, in its discretion, may dismiss the appeal and, if upholding it, would ordinarily impose a sentence which might be at the bottom of the range or less than that which ought to have been imposed at first instance: see Kalache (supra); Regina v. Webster [1999] NSWCCA 313, provided that, having regard to the necessity to denounce the error, the discretion and the other matters to be taken into account on re-sentencing, it might properly do so. 
    9   In considering the exercise of those discretions, it is necessary to have regard to other matters such as the double jeopardy in which the respondent has been placed (Holder (supra); Regina v. Warfield (1994) 34 NSWLR 2000); any delay in instituting the appeal; the extent to which the sentence imposed below has been served (Regina v. Morris (CCA, unreported 10 March 1989)); the extent of error detected in the original sentence and whether, if that sentence did not involve full-time custody, a re-sentencing to full-time custody is now appropriate (Allpass (supra)). 
    10   In Haughton (supra), Barr, J., with whom Fitzgerald, JA. and Abadee, J. agreed, referred to one circumstance which might call for the exercise of the discretion not to intervene:- 
     
      
       
       ""When this court hears an appeal by the Crown against what is said to be the severity of sentences, the court is not free to take the course it might if sentencing at first instance. A residual discretion exists which favours the respondent to any such appeal if the sentence is found to be below the range of sentencing discretion, but not so far below it that the court considers that it ought not to interfere."" 
       
      
    11   Further to what Barr, J. has noted in Haughton (supra), an occasion for the exercise of discretion in particular arises where error is detected in that a sentence is below the range of a proper sentencing discretion, but where the sentence which might be imposed on appeal, having regard, in particular, to those matters appropriate to be considered by the appellate court and the necessity to denounce error in the original sentence, would involve only a limited increase or limited change in the nature of the sentence but which would have a disproportionately onerous effect in the individual circumstances of the respondent. 
    12   Crown appeals exist for the correction of errors having general effects (see Everett (supra) and Griffiths (supra)). It follows, since the imposition of sentence is individual in effect, that the correction of such errors of general significance will have a specific impact on the respondent. Insofar, however, as the error proceeds from a failure in the sentencing process below and because its correction may have an impact, in the circumstances, of a particularly onerous kind, provided that the error may be properly corrected and the original criminal conduct as well as the leniency with which it has been treated properly denounced, then it is open to the court to avoid occasioning, by the re-sentencing process, consequences which in their effect would be unduly onerous. This is since the necessity to re-sentence is due to the judicial error, a failure in the process, rather than to any fault of the respondent and, in particular, so as to avoid that failure producing untoward hardship. 
    13   There was admitted in evidence on the appeal the affidavit of Mr. Taylor, the solicitor for the respondent. On the issue of discretion, it provided evidence that the respondent had been serving the sentence satisfactorily. For the purpose of any re-sentencing, it also provides evidence of the respondent's present particular health problems. 
    14   I turn to the particular facts of the appeal.  
    15   It appears from her Honour's remarks that she concluded that the offence had occurred on 27 January 1997 at about 11.30 pm (although there was a degree of uncertainty as to the circumstances in which the offence was committed) and was committed in an opportunistic exploitation of a robbery to which the respondent was not party. An acquaintance of the respondent, Mr. George Wright, had approached the respondent, the manager of the Blue Cattle Dog Tavern at St. Clair, seeking his participation in a hold-up at the Tavern. The respondent, when first approached, said he was not interested. His response was both in the negative and with shock. He revealed to a Ms. Gallagher, that he had been approached to this effect by Mr. Wright. Subsequently, on the evening of 27 January, he recognised Mr. Wright in the hotel and apparently realised that a robbery was about to occur some minutes before that offence occurred. Mr. Wright, with a shotgun, directed the respondent and other employees of the hotel into the hotel office where Mr. Wright removed a sum of money from the safe in the order of $20,000. Subsequently, Mr. Wright provided some $5,000 from those monies to the respondent. 
    16   The respondent was, on that evening, the most senior person in attendance at the hotel and in the ordinary course of events was the third most senior person in the management of the hotel: he was the manager of the bar. 
    17   Her Honour found that, at close of business on the evening before the robbery, there was a sum of some $50,000 odd in the hotel safe; that Mr. Wright was able to rob the premises of some $20,000; and that the respondent, although there was a degree of uncertainly as to the basis on which the jury reached its conclusion, had, in what her Honour described as ""an essentially opportunistic exercise"", under cover of the activities of Mr. Wright, removed from the safe a sum of some $30,000. Thus the respondent dishonestly obtained a total sum of some $35,000 of his employer's money. 
    18   Her Honour found that the respondent was, at the time, occupying a position of trust which he had egregiously abused; that in his maintenance of his innocence of the charge, he had displayed a lack of insight such that there was no mitigation by way of contrition available to him. 
    19   The sentencing judge correctly identified the facts as relevant to the charge of larceny as a servant, appropriately distinguishing those facts from the facts applicable to the robbery. This was necessary as the respondent had not been charged for any complicity in or as accessory after the armed robbery, nor with any offence involving the use of the firearm, nor with any offence against public justice, for example, seeking to divert the police investigation from his own activities. Her Honour held that, although his activities were opportunistic and not aggravated by any planning for the robbery, there was, however, a degree of planning for his own activities apparent from his seizing the chance to remove the money before the robber's appearance on the scene. 
    20   She had regard to both the evidence of the respondent's good character and good repute as of direct relevance to her assessment of the opportunistic nature of the offence. She also had regard to his prior offences for dishonesty in 1982, 1966 and 1964, treating the first as ""not necessarily a feature of aggravation in this context"". The respondent explained and her Honour apparently accepted the 1982 offence was committed at a time at which the respondent was responsible as a sole parent for the welfare of four children whilst under considerable financial pressure and the offences involved the stealing of groceries to feed his children. 
    21   Since the offences of 1966 and 1964, had occurred some 30 years prior, her Honour reached the view that it was inappropriate to have regard to them. 
    22   Her Honour made no finding concerning any restitution nor was there any evidence before her or this court either way concerning that matter. 
    23   Her Honour concluded that:- 
     
      
       
       ""The Crown puts before me that this is an offence for which the appropriate sentence is full-time imprisonment. That would be the case if there were any of the elements of the aggravation of the nature of the offence such as attended the offence with which Mr. Wright was charged. 
       
      
      
       
       It seems to me there are differences in the nature of the charges and of the circumstances; and that it would be inappropriate to have regard to any element of use of weaponry or placing of others in fear such as attended upon Mr. Wright's offence. The appropriate sentence is, therefore, one of imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention."" 
       
      
    24   She invited any submission from counsel on that issue and the Crown's submission was as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""Your Honour, the Crown's position is still one of full-time imprisonment and the arguments about law and reform and also periodic detention does have a strong element of leniency built into it. I just stand by my earlier submissions in relation to that. I cannot take it any further. I will not engage in terms, your Honour. I will not engage in that."" 
       
      
    25   Counsel for the respondent submitted that such a sentence was overly severe. 
    26   Her Honour, in response to that, expressed her view that it seemed to her that this offence was ""at the extreme end of the breach of trust"" and thus required a significant sentence. 
    27   As to the breach of trust, it seems on a reading of her remarks her Honour may not only have had regard to the breaches of trust involved in taking advantage of the criminal activities of another and in stealing from the employer (this latter was, of course, the very core of the offence with which he was charged), but also to the respondent's failure to protect his employer's interests by failing to reveal the intended robbery beforehand, later, the involvement of the robber and in failing afterwards to inform the police of the true position. No complaint is made here that it was wrong of her to so proceed. 
    28   At the time of the offence the respondent was 57 years of age, having raised the four children to whom I have referred. 
    29   A pre-sentence report tendered before her Honour on sentence showed that he had a strong relationship with his family and was a devoted family man. He was, at the time of sentence, self-employed, having lost his job, not surprisingly, as a hotel manager at the time of the offence. He had re-financed his house loan in order to obtain a courier van to start the business he was operating and appeared suitable for a community service work order or periodic detention. 
    30   In the written submissions filed on behalf of the Crown, it was contended that her Honour had fallen into error in the manner in which she treated the prior convictions of the respondent (see Regina v. Macdonald (CCA, unreported 12 October 1998). It was contended that those matters required her Honour to treat this offence as not an ""uncharacteristic aberration"" (Veen v. The Queen (No. 2) (1988-89) 164 CLR 465 at 477). 
    31   It was further submitted that the effect of the prior convictions was either to negate the evidence of good character or that that evidence of good character and the history of prior employment were such as to have, either because of the prior convictions or the nature of the crime, very much reduced significance. 
    32   Her Honour did not treat the prior offences as indicating a basis for depriving the respondent of leniency or as requiring a longer sentence or one of a different nature be imposed for the protection of the community. She did not find that he should receive leniency as might have been afforded to a person whose good character was not so marred. She did not expressly afford the good character reduced weight in the context of an offence of this general nature but her entire approach to this question was in the context of a discussion of character and prior offences as relating to any aggravation of the crime. She had earlier, when discussing the respondent's maintaining his innocence, held that there was, in the circumstances, nothing by way of mitigation. I would not regard her Honour's treatment of this matter as inappropriate so as to attract intervention. 
    33   The more substantial criticism advanced is not so much concerned with the sentence of imprisonment and its duration but with the order that it be served by way of periodic detention. 
    34   A sentence of imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention contains in-built leniency: Regina v. Duraux (CCA, unreported 11 April 1991) and is outwardly less severe in its denunciation of the offence: Regina v. Pangallo (CCA, unreported 20 February 1992); Regina v. Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67, although it remains a salutary form of punishment: Regina v. Burnett & Ors (1996) 85 A. Crim. R. 76. See also The Queen v. O'Keefe (1992) 60 A. Crim. R. 201. It is a sentence nominally of full-time imprisonment for the whole of its duration but to be served periodically. It is of greater severity than the recently re-introduced suspended sentence. The availability of that latter form of sentence may make the observations of the High Court in Regina v. Shrestha (1991) 173 CLR 48 to which I referred in Webster (supra) and which suggested that in an appropriate case considerations of mitigation or rehabilitation may make full-time custodial imprisonment unnecessary or even undesirable now applicable to the New South Wales sentencing regime. 
    35   It may be that the degree of comparative leniency involved in such a sentence may require re-consideration for that reason and also because of changes in executive policy as to how such a sentence is served from time to time (see the matters discussed by Hunt, CJ. at CL. in Hallocoglou (supra) and Barbara (supra) and the observations of Spigelman, CJ. in Jurisic (supra) at 214-25 concerning periodic detention, full-time imprisonment and home detention). 
    36   It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that her Honour erred in failing to give adequate regard to the principle of general deterrence, citing remarks of Gleeson, CJ. in Regina v. El Rashid (CCA, unreported 7 April 1995):- 
     
      
       
       ""Considerations of general deterrence are of particular importance in sentencing from crimes of this nature. Such crimes frequently involve … a serious breach of trust. Such breaches of trust are usually only able to be committed because of the previous good character of the person who has been placed in a position of trust."" 
       
      
    37   Both in El Rashid (supra) and in Regina v. Pantano (1990) 49 A. Crim. R. 328, reference was made to the principles to be applied when sentencing for white collar crime. In Pantano (supra) it was said:- 
     
      
       
       ""Those involved in serious white collar crime must expect condign sentences. General deterrence is an important element of sentencing for such offences."" 
       
      
    38   In El Rashid (supra), the Chief Justice referred to a number of cases in which in recent years the court discussed the principles to be applied in sentencing for white collar crimes, referring to Regina v. Corbett (1991) 52 A. Crim. R. 112, in which case reference was made to a number of comparable sentences. It is, however, notable that all of El Rashid (supra), Regina v. Kermali (CCA, unreported 6 July 1994) and Regina v. Mille (CCA, unreported 1 May 1998), were cases which referred to a multiplicity of offences committed over a period of time for substantial sums of money in circumstances of some degree of sophistication. It is notable that the court in Mille (supra) distinguished from the circumstances there applicable the remarks of Kirby, P. in The Queen v. Chaloner (1990) 49 A. Crim. R. 370 and in doing so, stressed the distinction between offences of the kind being considered in Mille and an offence committed on impulse. 
    39   In Mille (supra), the court held:- 
     
      
       
       ""It is the case that persons involved in serious crimes, particularly stealing from their employers, must expect condign sentences. See  
       Regina v. Halabi 
        (CCA, unreported 17 February 1992) and  
       The Queen v. Pantano 
        (1990) 49 A. Crim. R. 328."" 
       
      
    40   Halabi (supra), again, was a case involving a substantial sum and a crime committed with some sophistication. 
    41   Similarly, the matter of Regina v. Jalalaty (CCA, unreported 2 April 1997), related to the sentencing for over 30 offences committed over a lengthy period of time involving a level of planning and deception such as to raise the criminality of the offences to such a degree that the imposition of a custodial sentence such as was imposed was not outside the proper sentencing discretion. Other cases cited in relation to the relevance of the amount of money taken were not at all apposite in that reference was made, for instance, to Regina v. Hawkins (1989) 45 A. Crim. R. 430 involving a lengthy sentence on a professional for defrauding persons of monies in excess of $6.6 million over a period of some three and a half years. It is notorious that severe sentences have been passed and upheld as appropriate for solicitors, accountants and company directors dishonestly stealing or committing fraud particularly of large sums, by numerous dishonest acts or using sophisticated schemes. 
    42   In response, however, it was contended on behalf of the respondent that a principle that offences of dishonesty involving breach of trust would ordinarily attract a full-time custodial sentence, even where large sums and high trust are involved, was qualified to those cases where the breaches of trust involved planning, premeditation and some degree of sophistication. 
    43   In considering what her Honour had said as to the appropriate sentence having been full-time imprisonment if there had been any of the elements of aggravation (see the passage cited at para.19 above in which, however, her Honour may be referring to aggravation by involvement in the robbery), the submission was put that, in the light of the opportunism and the absence of the aggravating circumstances to which her Honour refers, the present sentence was appropriate. But it was conceded, on the authorities in this court, that where there are breaches of trust by employees, particularly involving large or substantial sums, involving systematic dishonesty attended by planning and some sophistication, general deterrence requires at least usually or in the absence of special features, that there be substantial sentences of imprisonment. 
    44   It was put that breach of trust, planning and repetition are key features of aggravation. In that regard, Regina v. Phelan (1993) 66 A. Crim. R. 446 was cited as was O'Keefe (supra) where the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to the court's duty to seek, by the penalties it imposes, the deterrence of others who might be tempted to commit such offences. There, the court held that in cases of dishonesty over a period of time involving substantial sums of money and multiple offences, the consideration of general deterrence looms large. It referred to Regina v. Glenister (1980) 2 NSWLR 597; Regina v. Falzon (CCA, unreported 20 February 1992); Regina v. McKechnie (CCA, unreported 1 October 1987) and Regina v. Debroun (CCA, unreported 12 December 1991) as illustrating a long line of decisions given in the court concerning the appropriate level of penalty for white collar crime. In the judgment of Lee, AJ. in O'Keefe (supra) appears the following:- 
     
      
       
       ""It is of the utmost importance that employers carrying on business and entrusting members of their staff with control of monies as must be done, should be entitled to maximum honesty in that activity and the courts play an important role and must play an important role in imposing sentences in cases of this nature which are often called white collar crimes - which will operate effectively as a deterrent to others like-minded, particularly when the monies are taken, as here, for the purpose of maintaining a lifestyle which the offender considers should be maintained. One recognises that in many cases where that occurs, the offender is concerned not so much in respect of her own lifestyle, but the lifestyle of her children or often her husband but where it is done for that purpose, that cannot be put forward as any matter entitling significant leniency."" 
       
      
    45   However, an examination of the sentencing statistics in respect of the crime of larceny by a servant for the past 10 years, indicates that imprisonment is imposed in less than one third of cases on individuals sentenced for one offence. Similarly, for the offence of embezzlement by clerks or servants. There does not appear to be discrimination between different categories of white collar crime. 
    46   Some discrimination is, however, to be detected. In a number of cases in which professional persons have committed offences of dishonesty involving substantial amounts, sentences of substantial imprisonment have been imposed. In such cases as The Queen v. Smith [2000] NSWCCA 140 (in which the court reviewed a number of other decisions, some of which themselves reviewed a number of earlier cases) the court sought to define an applicable principle. 
    47   By reference to those cases and such cases as Hawkins (supra) and Regina v. Cole (CCA, unreported 10 May 1974), the court concluded that persons (eg. solicitors) placed in a special position of trust by the law and the community who abuse that trust by dishonesty, call their profession into question and merit sentences calculated to ensure that other professional persons will be left in no doubt as to the serious consequences that will follow. 
    48   In Regina v. Kelvin [2000] NSWCCA 190 in respect of a sentence imposed upon an accountant that stood in a position of trust, not only in relation to his clients, but also to the Australian Tax Office, the court referred to such cases involving a breach of a position of trust as Regina v. Nguyen & Phan (1996) 86 A. Crim. R. 521 and reviewed a number of decisions in this court including that of Director of Public Prosecutions v. Hammond (CCA, unreported 1 December 1998) (a barrister) concluding that in respect of sentences for offences of defrauding the revenue, general deterrence is a predominant consideration. 
    49   In Regina v. Boland (CCA, unreported 13 October 1998), it was said, in the context of the sentencing of a solicitor on one count of fraudulent misappropriation of an amount of $48,759.08, in respect of the submission that the sentencing judge erroneously concluded that there was no option but to impose a sentence of full-time imprisonment, that the following remarks of the trial judge represented the correct principle:- 
     
      
       
       ""It is clear that breaches of trust of the nature that you have committed as solicitor inevitably demand punishment by way of full-time custody except in the most unusual of circumstances. Solicitors stand in a position of trust and responsibility to their clients and the public and it is essential that serious breaches of trust be treated as grave criminal activity."" 
       
      
    50   In this context, Stein, JA. went on to say:- 
     
      
       
       ""It is trite that there is no rule that in all cases of serious white collar crime a sentence other than a full-time custodian one is inapposite - see, for example, Hunt, CJ. at CL. in  
       Regina v. James Brown 
        (CCA, unreported 1 August 1994). 
       
      
      
       
       In the appeal of  
       Regina v. Chaloner 
        (1990) 49 A. Crim. R. 370, the court considered the issue. Kirby, P. had some important matters to state in relation to the issue with which the court is now faced. He said:- 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         'Whilst custodial sentences are normally to be imposed in circumstances such as the present, it is equally the duty of the judge to consider whether, in the special circumstances of the case, some features of the case warrant a non-custodial sentence. The deprivation of liberty is always a serious matter. Whether it is required in the particular case must always be considered. Normal rules, statutory authority apart, cannot be ossified into an inflexible requirement. The sentence discretion remained to be exercised in each case (at 375).' 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       It is also clear that in cases of the nature now before the court, involving a breach of trust by a solicitor, or for that matter another professional person standing in a similar position of trust, a full-time custodial sentence will be imposed except in cases involving some special or unusual feature or circumstances - see, for example,  
       Regina v. Pantano 
        (1990) 49 A. Crim. R. 328;  
       Regina v. Halabi 
        (CCA, unreported 17 February 1992); and  
       Regina v. Law 
        (CCA, unreported 7 October 1993)."" 
       
      
    51   In Regina v. Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 183, on an appeal under s.5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 by the Director of Public Prosecutions, a special bench of five judges of this court sat, the Chief Justice presiding. The judgment of the court was delivered by Foster, AJA. The respondent was a solicitor who had pleaded guilty to five counts of fraudulent misappropriation and had asked that a further 80 offences under the same section by taken into account. All told, there were defalcations of approximately $347,000 made between August 1989 and October 1992. The trial judge had imposed a sentence of three years' imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention and for other counts had deferred passing sentence under s.558 of the Crimes Act 1900 upon the respondent entering into a recognizance. 
    52   Foster, AJA. noted that the trial judge had referred to the remarks of Sully, J. in Regina v. Marvin (CCA, unreported 1 November 1995) concerning the offender in such circumstances betraying public trust and confidence and coming forward for sentence for a crime meriting in any but the most exceptional cases, a custodial sentence. He noted that the trial judge had referred to the special need for general deterrence and that there be a public warning to ensure that those entrusted with funds in the community will be warned by the harsh penalties imposed not to breach that trust. 
    53   His Honour referred to the circumstances of certain of the matters put forward on the prisoner's behalf as affording no justification for departure from ""the general principle requiring the imposition of a custodial sentence"". 
    54   The Crown appeal was dismissed but only having regard to circumstances particular and personal to that respondent. 
    55   The principles apply to professionals because the breach of trust abuses the special status they have and affects public confidence in all of their colleagues. Their crime undermines the institution of which they are members. 
    56   In a series of like cases, not however dealing with professionals, but involving ongoing sophisticated, systematic fraud, including of the revenue or of Commonwealth benefits, the principle has been somewhat differently expressed: eg. Regina v. Giallussi [1999] NSWCCA 56 
     
      
       
       ""A number of decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal have indicated that for offences of the type here involved, a full-time custodial sentence should be imposed unless there are special circumstances. See, for example,  
       Regina v. Boian & Carter 
        (CCA, unreported 10 October 1997);  
       Regina v. Sopher 
        (CCA, unreported 17 December 1993);  
       Regina v. Purdon 
        (CCA, unreported 27 March 1997);  
       Regina v. Luu 
        (CCA, unreported 7 December 1984. These cases stress the seriousness of such frauds and the need for sentences to incorporate elements of general deterrence."" 
       
      
    57   Those cases would appear to involve another matter of gravity akin to that to which attention is given in social security cases, that the States' resources to provide the benefits are thereby reduced and the offence is thus of wider effect and more grave. Such offences have the broader social effect in common with those of professionals. 
    58   The position of senior company employees or directors being sentenced for fraud or the like merits examination. In Regina v. Scott (CCA, unreported 7 November 1991), dealing with a charge of accessory after fact to larceny by the applicant's wife, in the context of a senior employee but a very small amount of money, Kirby, P. (with whom Gleeson, CJ. at Campbell, J. agreed) said:- 
     
      
       
       ""The starting point for the consideration of this submission is the recognition that the maximum penalty allowed by Parliament upon conviction under s.350 of the Crimes Act 1900 is five years penal servitude. The jury's verdict indicated acceptance that a serious crime by a person of seniority within the employment of the company had occurred. In him, Pain, DCJ. observed, the company had placed a high degree of trust. The courts have said on many occasions that sentencing persons convicted of offences as an employee to a custodial sentence will often be necessary because of the principle of general deterrence and in order to mark the court's disapproval of the abuse of a position of trust and responsibility. 
       
      
      
       
       Often crimes by company employees are difficult to detect. Nowhere is this more so today than in cases where the records exist, wholly or in part, in computer systems. In the present case, having regard to the Crown's concession at the trial, it should not be assumed for the purpose of sentencing that the applicant did manipulate the computer record to disguise the theft of his wife. However, his position of seniority in the company made it so much easier for him to cover her tracks and to discourage scrutiny and detection of the actions of a subordinate such as his wife. 
       
      
      
       
       It is because of the obligation to uphold the trust of employers in their employees and to deter breaches of such trust by senior employees that the courts frequently, and properly, respond to offences such as the present with the imposition of a custodial sentence. Clearly, the order that the sentence be served by periodic detention in this case mitigated its impact somewhat. Nevertheless, it remained a very serious punishment, reserved to the proper case."" 
       
      
    59   In Regina v. Houghton (supra), Barr, J. (with whom Fitzgerald, JA. and Abadee, J. agreed) reviewed a number of recent cases of sentences imposed for offences of a similar kind to that with which that respondent had been charged, that is, fraudulently applying company property whilst being a director. Those cases included Regina v. Ngui (CCA, unreported 23 August 1990); Regina v. O'Neil (CCA, unreported 24 July 1996); Regina v. Egerton (CCA, unreported 8 August 1997), noting that there were many separate gross breaches of trust carried out systematically over a period of three and a half years involving a very large sum of money and deceptive tactics to cover up the crimes and that the money was lost, the respondent being motivated by greed, his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
       ""Sentences imposed for offences involving such serious and persistent breaches of trust must be sufficient to deter others from offending, not least because they are so difficult to detect."" 
       
      
    60   The learned trial judge had sentenced the respondent to 26 concurrent terms each of two years' imprisonment, comprising a minimum term of 18 months and an additional term of six months. 
    61   Here too, the effect may be more serious as falling on a wide group of investors or creditors. 
    62   The position is not so clear when dealing with less senior employees, lesser amounts, few dishonest acts, lack of planning or sophistication. This phenomenon seems to underlie the wide range of sentences shown in New South Wales statistics.  
    63   Despite the differences in sentencing regimes, it is worthwhile to consider the approach taken elsewhere. In Queensland, in Regina v. Cox (1995) 85 A. Crim. R. 1, in respect of an offender who had pleaded guilty to one count of misappropriation as an employee of property of value in excess of $5,000, it was noted by Pincus, JA. that recent sentences imposed in the District Court in that State in such circumstances appeared to be nearly always non-custodial, but that there were decisions including Regina v. Seeney (Queensland CCA, unreported 11 August 1988) which would appear to support the sentence that had been passed. 
    64   Lee, J. asserted that persons who commit offences of this type, particularly those in a position of trust and responsibility, cannot expect that, if apprehended, the sentence imposed will always be of a non-custodial nature but that the circumstances of each case and of the offender must be taken into account. 
    65   Their Honours made these observations in the context of consideration of a schedule of sentences imposed at first instance for misappropriation or stealing as a servant. 
    66   In Victoria in The Queen v. Hoppner (CCA, unreported 7 October 1980), a court comprising Young, CJ., McGarvey and McInerney, JJ. dismissed an appeal in respect of a 12 month sentence of imprisonment with a six month non-parole period after a plea of guilty to one count of theft of some $3,213 by an employee with previous record of dishonesty in a position of trust as an assistant manager. The sentence was expressed to be one which was within the ambit of discretion of the sentencing judge having regard to the offence having been committed by an employee placed in a position of trust who had abused the trust confided in him by his employer. 
    67   ""In Sentencing - State and Federal Law in Victoria"" (2nd Ed) by Fox and Fryburg, the learned authors, in a detailed analysis of the sentences on indictment for specific instances of theft in Victoria note that such sentences rarely exceed three years and then usually because of the value of the property and the offender's prior record and that such custodial sentences are imposed upon persons often of middle age, of good character with no prior convictions but who have stolen over a lengthy period of time very large amounts of money and who have been charged with a number of offences. 
    68   They note that in that State, sentences in the mid-range one to two years, are imposed on persons in positions of trust although the amount taken is relatively small. Often, those sentences are suspended or offences of that kind punished by a substantial fine in addition to a shorter term of imprisonment.  
    69   In her analysis of the sentences of imprisonment in such circumstances in Tasmania, Kate Warner, in her text ""Sentencing in Tasmania"" (Federation Press 1990), p. 374, observes that sentences of imprisonment are almost invariably imposed when stealing from employer offences are prosecuted on indictment and that such sentences ranged in duration from two months to eight years with a median of 12 months. She says:- 
     
      
       
       ""In assessing the severity of the conduct, the amount of money or value of the property, the number of transactions involved, the length of time over which the dishonest behaviour continued and the amount of restitution are important considerations. The degree of trust given to the defendant is a particularly important factor so that cases of employment in a position of financial trust are more seriously regarded than cases of employees who are not so employed but steal in the course of their employment. In cases of abuse of a position of trust, good character and an absence of prior convictions are typical and have little weight because of the expressed need for a general deterrent sentence."" 
       
      
    70   Elsewhere (at p.375) she notes that the data for the period studied (1983-1989) showed clearly that only in exceptional cases of theft by an employee in a position of trust will a prison sentence be avoided and that it was rare that non-custodial options or suspended sentences were imposed. 
    71   In Canada, the position appears to be as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""Theft by persons occupying a position of trust are considered as a special category for sentencing purposes. Most convicted in such circumstances have no prior record and many come from a 'good' background, replete with family, education and community ties. Factors most often taken into consideration are the value of the theft, the amount (if any) repaid, whether the accused profited directly from the enterprise, the length of time over which the operation took place and the nature of the theft (ie., the degree of planning and sophistication). 
       
      
      
       
       The sentencing principle dominating consideration in these cases is general deterrence. In recognition of this (absent exceptional circumstances), a period of incarceration is almost invariably given. There is no rule, however, that merely because the theft is from an employer a period of incarceration is required. The range of sentence generally appears to be one to seven years. (Clayton C. Ruby, ""Sentencing"", (3rd ed.) Butterworths) 
       
      
    72   D.A. Thomas in ""Principles of Sentencing"" (2nd ed.) p.152 refers to the offsetting of the substantial mitigation involved where, as a consequence of such offences, a man of good character may stand to lose his career, pension, rights and possibly his home as a result of his conviction against the aggravating effect of the abuse of trust which the offence constitutes. He refers to the pronouncements by courts that ""others faced with a similar temptation must … be fortified by knowing that the penalty for committing a breach of trust is bound to be … a sentence of substantial duration"" with reference at least to offences involving the misappropriation over a period of time of some thousands of pounds: see Regina v. Hunter (CCA, unreported 18 November 1976). He refers by way of illustration to cases in which immediate imprisonment for systematic breach of trust has been upheld. 
    73   Recently in the United Kingdom in Regina v. Barrick (3 May 1985), a court presided over by the Lord Chief Justice, gave detailed guidelines for sentencing in cases of theft in breach of trust by employees and professional persons. The appellant had been convicted of four counts of false accounting, four counts of obtaining by deception and two counts of theft. He had, over a period of time, stolen a total of at least 9,000 pounds and had been sentenced to two years' imprisonment. His Honour noted that there had been some divergence of opinion as to the proper sentence to be passed in respect of certain types of theft and fraud and that there should be no distinction on that ground alone between solicitors and other professional men, on the one hand, and others following an occupation which placed them in a position of trust. He concluded that (at 146):- 
     
      
       
       ""In general, a term of immediate imprisonment is inevitable, save in very exceptional circumstances or where the amount of money obtained is small. Despite the great punishment that offenders of this sort bring upon themselves, the court should nevertheless pass a sufficiently substantial term of imprisonment to mark publicly the gravity of the offence. The sum involved is obviously not the only factor to be considered, but it may in many cases provide a useful guide."" 
       
      
    74   His Honour's judgment continued:- 
     
      
       
       ""The following are some of the matters to which the court will no doubt wish to pay regard in determining what the proper level of sentence should be: (i) the quality and degree of trust reposed in the offender including his rank; (ii) the period over which the fraud or the thefts had been perpetrated; (iii) the use to which the money or property taken was put; (iv) the effect on the victim; (v) the impact of the offences on the public and public confidence; (vi) the effect on fellow employees or partners; (vii) the effect on the offender himself; (viii) his own history; and (ix) those matters of mitigation special to the offender, such as illness, being placed under great strain by excessive responsibility or the like, where, as sometimes happened, there had been a long delay, say, over two years, between his being confronted with his dishonesty and the start of his trial and any help given by him to the police."" 
       
      
    75   The consideration of those criteria would be made having regard in the instant case to the precise offence charged, its elements and the applicable statutory maximum (as they may differ dramatically) from case to case. 
    76   I have, in this survey, admittedly by looking at examples rather than seeking to make an exhaustive analysis, sought to discern whether there is or should be some such principle as would normally, or in the absence of exceptional features, require sentences of full-time custodial imprisonment to be passed in cases of single offence, breach of trust, employee dishonesty, albeit involving a substantial but not enormous sum. Whilst it seems clear that there is such a principle as would require imprisonment in the absence of exceptional circumstances of defalcating professionals or others, eg., company directors, whose crimes are of considerable extent and wide effect, I am unable to conclude that there is a useful statement of such a principle of general applicability in cases where persons are in a position of trust, the position of trust arising out of an employer/employee relationship. Expressions of the necessity for general deterrence and condign punishment are of limited utility to define the appropriate nature of the sanction to be employed in such circumstances. It may well be that this is the sort of case which draws attention to the prospect of this court providing a guideline judgment for such matters. 
    77   In this case then, for the reasons I have given, I am unpersuaded that her Honour fell into appellable error by failing to accord proper recognition to some general principle which would have required full-time imprisonment. 
    78   I turn to the objective circumstances of this particular case. Having regard to the severe breach of trust involved, particularly in the context of the utilisation of another's gross criminality against a victim to whom the applicant had, by reason of his employment, special duty, her Honour's reaction to this offence as one being ""at the extreme end of the breach of trust"" was entirely appropriate. In many ways so to breach trust and to take advantage of another's criminality in this way is worse than simply stealing from an employer under guise of some ineffective accounting or security system. It can be said that this is much more serious than having one's hand in the till. 
    79   Notwithstanding the subjective matters to which her Honour referred, I consider that her sentence was in error, particularly as it was directed to have been served by way of periodic detention. Indeed, I consider that the sentence, in duration and because of that direction, was impermissibly lenient and so disproportionate to the objective culpability as to show error of the kind that, absent the exercise of the discretion to which I referred at the commencement of this judgment, would require the intervention of this court in the exercise of the corrective function I have earlier referred to. 
    80   The sentence, however, has, to a great extent, as I have pointed out, been served since, by reason of the direction it be served by way of periodic detention, the attendances of the respondent for the custodial periods of the sentence satisfies the requirements of the legislation and amounts to service of the term of the sentence. 
    81   Were the applicant to be re-sentenced, it would be necessary to have regard to the legislation's effect that the period during which the applicant has attended periodically should be considered as serving the sentence. That is not to say that credit to the full extent of the duration involved would necessarily be given to the applicant if the applicant were now sentenced to full-time custody. But a substantial allowance would have to be made in respect of the period taken to be served by reason of the applicant having attended periodically as required by the original sentence. A substituted sentence of substantial duration of full-time imprisonment on top of what has been served would have a drastic impact. 
    82   Further, on a re-sentencing it would not simply be a matter of setting aside the direction for periodic detention leaving a sentence of three years fixed term. It would be necessary for the court to readjust the duration and make up of the sentence and to consider the imposition of a non-parole period. It would be appropriate, particularly with the applicant having apparently responded to periodic imprisonment and on the additional evidence of the applicant's particular health problems, that the applicant receive the benefit of a parole period. 
    83   Having regard to those matters and those I have earlier referred to concerning what course the court might take on allowing a Crown appeal, it would seem that any full-time custodial sentence would contain a period of actual custody which would be unlikely to be much in excess of the period taken to be served so far. I consider these matters have such effect that in this most exceptional case, the court should, in discretion, refrain from intervening, notwithstanding the cynical behaviour in breach of trust of the respondent. It may have been, had the Crown brought the matter on for hearing earlier, that a different course would have been taken. 
    84   In all the circumstances, however, I conclude that the appeal should be dismissed.

      SENTENCE 
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: This matter, in view of the age of the young person, is a hearing under the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, s11 of which provides for the non-publication of the young person's name. I will therefore describe him in the published judgment under the initials set out in the heading to these remarks on sentence, and other young persons by their initials. 
     
      
    2    RG was committed to this court, together with a co-accused, PL, for trial of a number of serious offences, including murder and robbery in company. Although a trial date was fixed, that was vacated after PL indicated that he wished to change his plea to guilty of robbery in company. 
     
      
    3    On 4 August 2000, the Crown presented an indictment charging RG with one count of robbery in company, contrary to s97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 ('the Act'), to which he pleaded guilty. That plea of guilty is taken into account by me in the decision that I make in relation to RG. 
     
      
    4    The original indictment was that on 11 January 1999, at Berkeley, in the State of New South Wales, whilst in the company of two other young persons, one of whom was PL, and a Johnathon Whitfield, RG was charged with robbing Ralph Mason of one compact disc player and one mobile phone. Both items were the property of Ralph Mason. 
     
      
    5    RG pleaded guilty to that charge, and the matter was stood over to 20 October 2000 for submissions on sentence. 
     
      
    6    The facts of the proceedings are that on 11 January 1999, at 12.45am, a neighbour of Ralph Mason, a Mr Galea, was watching television at his home in Berkeley Street, Berkeley. He heard his dog bark and a person screaming for help. Mr Galea went and looked towards the front yard of his neighbour's home and noticed that a person was standing near the white picket fence that divided the two properties, and that the person was waving an arm. That person then moved from Mr Galea's line of vision. Mr Galea returned to watching television, believing that it was just the local kids playing around. 
     
      
    7    As Mr Galea walked towards the back of the house, he noticed that another neighbour had a light on in the backyard. Mr Galea then had a short conversation with the neighbour and returned to his television set. 
     
      
    8    As he went back to his house, Mr Galea went into the laundry which looks out on to Mr Mason's property. Mr Galea looked out and observed someone walking quickly inside the Mason premises, leap forward onto something and then take a couple of steps forward and fall to the floor. Mr Galea contacted the police and returned to his laundry window, where he could see someone on the floor of the premises. 
     
      
    9    What had happened was that the three young people and Johnathon Whitfield had gone onto the premises, that RG and PL had run away when the deceased came towards them, but that RG observed Johnathon Whitfield striking the deceased with a pole which had been taken by the young people. 
     
      
    10    Police attended shortly after 1am, and as they approached 29 Berkeley Road, a sensor light came on. They observed a trail of blood on the concrete leading to the front door. The front screen door was buckled. At the rear of the house, police found bloodstains on the carpet, and discovered the deceased lying on the floor beside a lounge. A telephone cord was stretched from the wall to the deceased, with the handset under the deceased. Bloodstains on the carpet were in the room adjacent to the front door, and a pot-plant had been knocked over. 
     
      
    11    After being conveyed to Wollongong Hospital, a post-mortem examination was conducted which revealed two stab wounds to the deceased's back, one penetrating the aorta, inferior vena cava and the kidney. There were some head injuries, causing a fracture to the skull. 
     
      
    12    During an electronically recorded interview with police, RG admitted to being at the scene of the murder with three other youths. RG said that he was with PL, and that Johnathon Whitfield had kicked the screen door, that Whitfield had forced his way into the premises, and that he was followed by the other two. PL had a metal pole with him and there was also a knife. 
     
      
    13    During the interview, RG admitted that some pre-planning had been discussed concerning the incident, but there was no planning that there would be any injury to the deceased. They had chosen the deceased's premises to rob because he was a rich man, and that they were going to ""just keep all the stuff"", to use their words. 
     
      
    14    RG was twelve years of age when he was involved in the offence. He is now fourteen. It is, therefore, necessary to have regard to the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 in looking at sentencing. 
     
      
    15    Part 2 Div 4 of that Act provides that where there has been a plea to an indictable offence and it is not a ""serious indictable offence"", the matter can be dealt with at a Children's Court. 
     
      
    16    If the conviction had been for a ""serious indictable offence"", then the matter must be dealt with according to law. The offence of robbery in company, contrary to s97 of the Act, carries a penalty of imprisonment for twenty years. It is not a serious indictable offence for the purposes of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, and it may therefore be dealt with under Part 3 of that Act as though this court were exercising the powers of a Children's Court. 
     
      
    17    In determining whether a sentencing judge deals with an offender according to law or according to the less harsh regime of the Children's Court, it has been held in R v R (1993) 71 A Crim R 95, a decision of Hunt CJ at CL at pp 98-99, that some of the matters to be taken into account are the nature of the particular offence for which the offender is standing for sentence, the age and maturity of that offender, both at the time of the offence and when standing for sentence, and the nature of the penalty which would be appropriate in the circumstances. 
     
      
    18    Clearly RG is an offender who, because of age and circumstances of the offence, and the likely penalty, it is appropriate that he be dealt with under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, and that this court should sit as a Children's Court. 
     
      
    19    RG is, as I have indicated, fourteen years of age. His mother has an Australian-Greek culture, and his father is South African. Both RG and his younger brother reside with their mother at Marrickville. 
     
      
    20    When RG was two years of age, his parents separated. He has had minimal contact with his father since then, seeing him only for birthdays and Christmas. At the age of three, according to his mother, RG displayed tantrums. His mother attributes his behaviour to his reaction to the parental separation. 
     
      
    21    RG's mother has indicated that since RG became of school age, his relationship with his brother deteriorated. RG would be unkind and would tease his younger brother, leading to fighting amongst the siblings. RG, being the instigator, would be punished and this created sibling rivalry and tension, until the young person's grandparents raised the question of whether the younger brother was being favoured. Consequently, the mother re-evaluated the parenting and attempted to treat the two as equally as possible. 
     
      
    22    RG has had little social contact in his local area. His peers included other ""black youth"", to quote from the Juvenile Justice report, some of whom are known by Juvenile Justice. 
     
      
    23    RG's first encounter with Juvenile Justice arose out of his aggressive and volatile behaviour towards his mother. According to his mother, RG would break windows, doors and mirrors in the house, and would push her. This aggressive behaviour led to the mother not accepting him in the home, and in taking out an Apprehended Violence Order against RG. 
     
      
    24    However, since the time of this offence, the young person's mother has noticed significant changes in his behaviour and says that he no longer has been violent at home, and that his relationship with his younger brother has improved. He has been positive in his interactions both with his mother and his younger brother, and he has also displayed a keen interest in discussing matters such as the safety and security of the home. RG has also demonstrated very clearly that he wants a higher level of security around the home, and that he is concerned at how fragile the human body is. 
     
      
    25    According to the Juvenile Justice report, RG has a keen interest in his dogs and displays affection and interest towards them. His interest is shared with other peers with similar dogs. 
     
      
    26    RG has been under the supervision of the Stanmore Intensive Programs Unit of the Department of Juvenile Justice, a unit which comprises psychologists and social workers. The Unit has supervised RG since 10 February 1998. RG maintains a satisfactory attendance and response attitude towards his supervision requirements, however he failed to comply with some of the bail conditions. 
     
      
    27    RG has been extremely co-operative with the assessment procedure, and has discussed his conduct with the counsellor, despite the anger and conflict which is still within him. 
     
      
    28    I accept that the loss of RG's father and lack of role models and cultural identity issues and racial enmity shown towards him, make him very much subject to peer pressures. 
     
      
    29    The Stanmore Intensive Programs Unit is capable of supervising RG in any program that this court may impose. It appeared to the author of the report to this court that RG had no awareness of the degree of harm and injury a pole such as the one that was taken could inflict. According to RG, as the deceased charged towards them, he held the pole in the air and said, ""Get back into the room"", and when the man kept charging, RG stated that he and PL ran from the house. RG stated that he was scared and felt that the man would knock them over, and that his only response was to run into the street. While in the street, RG states that he looked back for a moment and then ran to TCP’s house.  
     
      
    30    RG states that he felt scared at the time of the incident, especially when he saw Johnny Whitfield beating the deceased. RG mentioned that he wanted to stop Johnny from hitting the man, but felt that he could not because he was just twelve years old and Johnny was sixteen or seventeen years old. 
     
      
    31    According to RG, if he could change one thing in his life it would be never to have gone and robbed the deceased. It appears that RG felt powerless in the situation. RG states that he had never broken into someone's home before, and that he did not know what to expect. As a consequence, RG said that he would never break into someone's home again. 
     
      
    32    I am satisfied that RG appreciates the seriousness of the actions in which he was involved, and that it has had a significant change in his attitude. 
     
      
    33    RG is now attending the Edgeware School at Dulwich Hill, a school for youths with emotional and behavioural problems. 
     
      
    34    The Crown case against Whitfield was considerably strengthened by the evidence of PL, who had undertaken to give evidence, that undertaking being a matter which I took into account when sentencing PL recently. 
     
      
    35    RG has also given an undertaking to the Crown that he will similarly give evidence against Whitfield, a matter which I have also taken into account in the assessment of the way in which I deal with RG. I also take into account, as I indicated, RG’s plea of guilty. 
     
      
    36    RG was in custody in respect of this charge until he was granted bail, for 176 days. It is conceded by the Crown, and I accept, that the actions of RG in relation to the offence were of a similar level of criminality to that of PL. 
     
      
    37    The offence of robbery in company is a serious one and has been the subject of a guideline judgment. However, the youth of RG means that he is not subject to the regime proposed by that judgment, and I have indicated that it is appropriate that he be dealt with under Part 3, Division 4 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. 
     
      
    38    I have taken into account the carefully prepared and impressive report by Adelaide White, Juvenile Justice Counsellor. The report conveys that there is still a level of aggression within RG, but that he is young and subject to peer group pressures and racial enmity, causing him to be alienated from other people of his age. 
     
      
    39    I also take into account, noting the objective seriousness, that it would cause a justifiable sense of grievance if there was disparity between the sentence of PL and RG. There is no justifiable sense of grievance if the co-offender is sentenced on different facts or is less seriously involved. As held in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 620: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        It is obviously desirable that persons who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are not always equal, and such matters as the age, background, previous criminal history and general character of the offender and the part which he or she played in the commission of the offence have to be taken into account"" (at 623). 
        
       
      
    40    Clearly, the role of RG and PL in these proceedings are identical. It seems to me, therefore, that similarly to PL, RG should not serve a custodial sentence, but that he should be released on strict conditions for two years and that a probation order be imposed. The conditions that I impose are: 
     
      
       
        
        1. That he is to obey the reasonable directions and guidance of the Department of Juvenile Justice. 
         
        2. That he is to attend programs as directed by the Manager of the Intensive Programs Unit. 
         
        3. That he is to attend counselling as directed by the Manager of the Intensive Programs Unit. 
         
        4. That he is to make reasonable efforts to gain and maintain educational training. 
         
        5. That he is to reside as directed by the Manager of the Intensive Programs Unit. 
         
        6. That he is to be of good behaviour and commit no further criminal offences, and is to keep the peace. 
         
        7. That he is to give evidence in accordance with the undertaking that he has given. 
        
       
      
    41    I therefore impose a probation order for two years on the conditions that I have just enumerated.

     Regina v Peter Kevin Bourke 
      
      
      
     Judgment 
    1     HIDDEN J: The applicant, Peter Kevin Bourke, pleaded guilty in the District Court to an indictment containing four counts. The first count was breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing a felony in circumstances of special aggravation, an offence under s 112(3) of the Crimes Act 1900, carrying a maximum sentence of 25 years. The second count was malicious wounding, an offence under s 35 of the Crimes Act carrying a maximum sentence of seven years. The third count was breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing a felony in circumstances of aggravation under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act, that offence carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years. The fourth count was a common law offence of false imprisonment for which, of course, no maximum sentence is prescribed. 
     
      
       
      
    2     The felony alleged in the first and most serious count was malicious wounding and in the third count assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 
     
      
       
      
    3     On the first count the learned sentencing judge sentenced the applicant to penal servitude for twelve years, comprising a minimum term of nine years and an additional term of three years to date from 28 February 1998, the date on which he was taken into custody. On the other counts his Honour sentenced the applicant respectively to fixed terms of four years, five years and two years, those terms also to date from the date he was taken into custody. 
     
      
       
      
    4     I should observe that he was sentenced on 6 August 1998 and did not file his application for leave to appeal against sentence until 22 June 1999. However, there is no objection to an extension of time and we have proceeded to hear the matter. He now seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. 
     
      
       
      
    5     The victim of the second count, the charge of malicious wounding, was Ms Heather McKenzie, a lady with whom the applicant had had a relationship. It seems that that relationship had come to an end in circumstances of violence of some kind, but what those circumstances were we were not told. The victim of the first count was Ms McKenzie's father, Mr Graham McKenzie, and at the time the two of them were at a house in Binalong Street, Young. The victim of the fourth count, false imprisonment, was the applicant's brother, Bruce Bourke, and the victim of the third count, that is the charge of breaking and entering and committing a felony, that is, assault occasioning actual bodily harm was Bruce Bourke's wife, Alison Bourke. They resided at the time in a house at Caple Street, Young. 
     
      
       
      
    6     Shortly the facts are these: on the evening of 27 February 1998 the applicant was drinking at a hotel in Young until it closed at about 3am the following day. He then went firstly to his brother's house in Caple Street. He gained entry by damaging the front door after trying to enter by the rear door.  
     
      
       
      
    7     Ms Alison Bourke, his sister-in-law, phoned the police. The applicant confronted her with a knife, he pushed her and kicked her and pulled the phone from the wall. He dragged his brother, Bruce Bourke by his hair to a shed at the rear holding a knife at his throat. He punched his brother and then held the knife at his own stomach and taunted his brother to stab him. He then escorted his brother back to the house, telling him he was a hostage. He searched the house for his sister-in-law, who had managed to leave it, threatening to kill her. The police arrived and he escaped by the rear door of the house. 
     
      
       
      
    8     He then went to the McKenzie home in Binalong Street. He gained entry by breaking a window at the rear of the home with a chair. He entered the premises still with the knife. He became involved in a violent struggle with Mr Graham McKenzie and he stabbed Mr McKenzie a number of times to his torso, arm and head. Mr McKenzie suffered quite significant injuries as a result. 
     
      
       
      
    9     Heather McKenzie became involved in the struggle and he struck her with the knife on the arm and the back of the head. Mr McKenzie took hold of a stool to protect his daughter and he struck the applicant on the back of the head. He later hit him, over the back of the head also, with a porcelain water jug, which broke and caused significant cuts to Mr McKenzie's fingers. 
     
      
       
      
    10     The applicant left the premises. A little later he was escorted to hospital in police custody where he was treated for his own injuries and then taken to Young Police Station. 
     
      
       
      
    11     It is clear that he was seriously intoxicated and his Honour so found. There was evidence that he was in a very distressed state. Among other things he told a police officer that he wanted to kill himself. 
     
      
       
      
    12     I have already referred to the breakdown of his relationship with Ms Heather McKenzie, and there was some material before his Honour affording some explanation of his animosity towards the victims of the other offences. None of this, however, came anywhere near providing any adequate explanation for his extraordinary behaviour on this night. Indeed, in addressing the learned sentencing judge, his counsel in the District Court, who did not appear in this Court, said that he appeared to have little understanding of what got into him that night. 
     
      
       
      
    13     The applicant is a man of Aboriginal extraction. He is now twenty-seven years old and was twenty-four at the time of the offences. He has what his Honour described as a significant criminal record, starting in the Children's Court at the age of sixteen and containing some entries for offences of violence and some prior terms of imprisonment. I mention in passing that since being dealt with for these matters he has been sentenced to a further concurrent term of imprisonment for some offences which must have been outstanding at the time he was taken into custody, but no further reference need be made to that matter. 
     
      
       
      
    14     The charges to which he pleaded guilty were apparently the subject of some negotiation but his Honour accepted that his pleas of guilty were entered at the earliest reasonable opportunity and they were, of course, entitled at least to the utilitarian value of which this Court has spoken most recently in R v Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309. His Honour fixed the twelve year sentence on the major charge with an eye to the totality of the applicant's criminality and he said, that but for the plea of guilty, he would have imposed a sentence of the order of fifteen to sixteen years. 
     
      
       
      
    15     The sentencing proceedings were conducted with a measure of informality and no evidence was called on the applicant's behalf. Nevertheless, material was put from the Bar table which his Honour accepted and acted upon. 
     
      
       
      
    16     His Honour described the applicant as having had a deprived background. It seems that his father, who was rarely in employment, was an alcoholic and a violent man. The applicant left school at the age of fifteen in Year 9 and pursued labouring jobs interspersed with periods in custody. He has had a significant alcohol problem from an early age. 
     
      
       
      
    17     Against that briefly sketched background his Honour considered that the applicant ought to have the benefit of the special considerations affecting the sentencing of Aboriginal persons, with which the Chief Judge at Common Law dealt in R v Fernando (1992) 76 ACrim R 58. The Crown Prosecutor before us pointed out there was nothing like the volume of evidence that there was in Fernando touching upon this question, but it does appear to me that his Honour was entitled to treat the matter in that way, given that the briefly sketched background of the applicant was not inconsistent with that commonly seen in persons of Aboriginal extraction. 
     
      
       
      
    18     The applicant anticipated that he would have to spend part, at least, if not all of his sentence on protection because of some animosity borne by some other prisoners to his brother, and that is a matter his Honour also took into account. 
     
      
       
      
    19     His Honour saw some prospects of rehabilitation for the applicant, particularly given his relative youth. The matter of special circumstances was raised but his Honour did not find them, possibly because the sentence which he proposed would involve a substantial additional term even by the application of the usual proportion between minimum and additional terms. 
     
      
       
      
    20     Before us, Mr Andrews of counsel for the applicant has argued that the effective sentence is manifestly excessive and that, in any event, his Honour ought to have found special circumstances. 
     
      
       
      
    21     These were very serious offences and there can be no doubt that sentences with a marked degree of deterrence were called for. We have not had the benefit of references to statistics or comparable cases. I make no criticism of counsel on either side in that regard, because I suspect, particularly so far as the major charge is concerned, there would be very few cases available to provide any guidance. 
     
      
       
      
    22     What troubles me is the expressed starting point which his Honour enunciated of some fifteen to sixteen years. Notwithstanding the seriousness of these offences that does appear to me to be very high. It is a sentence not uncommonly passed in murder cases, although it is by no means the top of the range for an ordinary case of that kind. 
     
      
       
      
    23     The significant discount inherent in his Honour's reasons for the pleas of guilty was, in my view, entirely justified. It appears to me then that his Honour's approach to his sentencing task, putting aside the starting point to which I have referred was, with respect, beyond criticism. His Honour had regard to every relevant matter and in particular, as I have said, gave entirely appropriate weight to the pleas of guilty. Where his Honour fell into error, in my view, was to fashion the sentence around a starting point of some fifteen to sixteen years which, I am satisfied, is just too high. 
     
      
       
      
    24     For those reasons I am of the view that this Court should intervene. In arriving at the appropriate sentences, I have had regard to some additional material (including a psychiatric report) received for the purpose of re-sentence. The orders I propose are these: I would confirm the sentences on counts two, three and four but I would quash the sentence on count one. In lieu, on count one I would sentence the applicant to imprisonment for ten years to date from 28 February 1998 with a non-parole period of six years. 
     
      
       
      
    25     It follows from what I have said that, in my view, there are special circumstances warranting a significant departure from the usual proportion between head sentence and non-parole period. 
     
      
       
      
    26     SIMPSON J: I agree. The orders of the Court will be as proposed by Hidden J.

      REGINA v. SAMUEL NOEL LEVER 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: On 30 November 1999 the offender, Samuel Noel Lever, was found guilty by the verdict of a jury of the crime of murder. He had, on the night of 15 November 1996, at Fingal in the State of New South Wales, murdered his life partner, Linda Jo Lever. 
    2   Objectively, the crime was an appalling one. The offender beat his wife to death using a baton and a strap. He inflicted upwards of 200 blows. He may have kicked his wife, or kneed her, in this ferocious bout of abuse. Following this attack, however, he sought to care for his wife. He summoned the ambulance. When arrested by the police, almost irrationally and incoherently, he sought to explain what he had done and what had occurred. I am entirely satisfied that at that time he was, to some considerable degree, irrational, grieving and contrite. 
    3   By way of background, it appears, in particular from the observations of Mr. Chalk, who had known the offender professionally and socially, that the offender's conduct had, for months, progressively changed from normal and that he had become, using the term in its lay sense, increasingly paranoid. In particular, the focus of his paranoia was his wife and, as it has been put, on her involvement, in some manner, with some harassment of his home and his family, which he believed he was being subjected to, which harassment may have been based on what was actually occurring in some more or less degree, or have been entirely within his mind, which was, at the time of the killing, I find, gravely affected, at least to the extent of his suffering from the disturbance to which I have referred and some considerable degree of depression. 
    4   I shall return to the question of the verdict and its effect, and the findings that I might make in law as to the state of the accused's mind at the time of the killing, later in these reasons. 
    5   There is evidence before me that during the relationship of the offender with the deceased he had subjected her to serious violence on occasions. Indeed, there were occasions on which he beat her very severely, on at least one occasion resulting in her hospitalisation suffering from a serious injury. 
    6   There was also evidence to show that he believed, on occasions, apparently without any rational foundation and sometimes in beliefs attended by bizarre overtones, that she had been sexually unfaithful, or was being sexually unfaithful, to him. 
    7   Whatever be the surrounding circumstances, generally, on the night in question, no evidence could be found to support, objectively, a belief that the home was being harassed, or that she was being unfaithful to him. Indeed, over the years, notwithstanding his treatment of her, she had apparently remained a loving wife and mother, with concern for her family, and he a loving husband and father. Indeed, there is evidence before me now, which I accept, of his deep concern for his children, and there was evidence from the ERISP to the police of his deep concern for her shortly after her death. 
    8   In that context it falls to me to sentence the prisoner for the most serious crime in the calendar: the taking not only of a human life but the taking of the life of his spouse, taken in such a brutal way. The verdict of the jury established that the prisoner at the least intended, by the beating he inflicted, to occasion grievous bodily harm to the deceased. I am unable to be satisfied to the requisite standard that he intended to kill her, but the sheer number of blows and the sheer extent of the beating is such as to satisfy me that he must have realised that he, by his actions, would occasion her serious bodily injury had he been reasoning rationally and normally at the time of the beating. 
    9   There were, in substance, only two issues at the trial. One related to the cause of death. A question arose as to whether amphetamines might have played some role. The jury was not satisfied that there was such a role, if any, as might have displaced the effect of the beating in causing her death. I am not satisfied that there was any role played in the occasioning of her death by such drugs as she might have taken leading to the forensic pathologist's findings that were ventilated at the trial. But, even if there had been some such role, it would not, in any way, displace, either factually or in culpability, the effect of the beating he administered. 
    10   The Crown has submitted that the objective seriousness of the matter was great, and I have been referred to rib fractures and soft tissue injuries to the deceased, although it is conceded that it is not possible to ascertain what precisely caused the fractures. It is submitted by the Crown, and I accept, that I could not be satisfied that the prisoner himself was affected by drugs or alcohol at the time such as, in any way, to mitigate this culpability, and that I could not accept that what occurred on this occasion, as far as the infliction of violence was concerned, was an isolated matter. 
    11   On the other hand, when I come to the other great issue at the trial, that is the mental condition of the offender, I conclude, in the light of the psychiatric evidence before the jury at the trial from Dr. Westmore and Dr. Nielssen, from the subsequent psychiatric evidence given orally by Dr. Nielssen, and by the numerous reports provided by the Crown and the defence from Dr. Nielssen and Dr. Westmore, that I cannot regard that episode of violence in which the offender beat his wife to this extent as otherwise than atypical. This episode I find, even having regard to the previous violent history, involved conduct of such an extent as to be so aberrant as to accord with what Dr. Nielssen said in his evidence on sentence before me. 
    12   I accept the psychiatric diagnoses from both Dr. Nielssen and Dr. Westmore; that is, that the prisoner was suffering at the time of the infliction of these appalling injuries upon his wife from a serious mental condition, and I accept what Dr. Nielssen has said in evidence most recently today that there may also have been a transient psychotic episode overlying a more general chronic condition. But, whilst I accept those matters of fact, on the evidence now before me they are of limited significance to the course I must now take for the reasons I will now give. 
    13   At trial the defence advanced the defence of diminished responsibility under the law then applicable, and that defence was rejected by the jury. In the light of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374, I am entitled to form my own view of the facts on the evidence at trial and on sentence before me, provided that that view is consistent with the jury's verdict. Although it is not open to me to enquire of the jury as to the basis of its verdict, where, as here, the only, or in this case the only, relevant issue advanced has been rejected by the jury, it is not open to me to sentence on a basis inconsistent with that verdict and in acceptance of the matters the jury has rejected. 
    14   Consequently, the accused must be sentenced on the basis that he does not have available to him those matters of fact which would have founded a defence of diminished responsibility, that defence having been rejected by the jury. Nor might the accused be sentenced on the basis that he was psychotic at the time, even though I accept the evidence of the psychiatrists now given that he possibly was, or mentally ill within the meaning of the mental health legislation. 
    15   How does this problem come about? At the trial Dr. Westmore gave evidence supporting a defence of diminished responsibility. Dr. Nielssen, called for the Crown and appraised of such circumstances with which he had been provided by the Crown, expressed the view that he could not support the existence of those matters which might give rise to the defence. Subsequently, Dr. Nielssen became apprised of factual matters concerning the accused's belief in harassments and his deteriorating conduct, to which I have referred, following a conversation with Mr. Chalk. The surrounding circumstances to that matter are set out in the accounts of Mr. Chalk in his affidavits and in material supplied on sentence. 
    16   Dr. Nielssen thereafter took a different view to the view that he had taken at the trial. Following some questions by me concerning the terminology used at the trial, Dr. Nielssen provided additional reports and has given evidence on a number of occasions. It has now become entirely apparent that there is a unanimity of conclusion supporting the diagnoses I have referred to between the psychiatrists and that that unanimity of conclusion is, at least to a certain extent, supported by the view of Dr. Davies on the offender's admission to gaol. Thus, the Crown evidence at trial and on sentence was entirely contrary on this. 
    17   It was in consequence of what I have been told was this unique circumstance that the sentencing of this matter was deferred, and has been deferred, for almost a year, to allow the Crown and the defence to make further enquiry as to what course should properly be taken. The last step in that process was taken today, when I drew to the attention of all parties the provisions of s.474D and s.474E of the Crimes Act 1900. Whilst the Crown was prepared to concede that on the material at the time of the acts causing death the offender might well have had such abnormality of mind as the defence of diminished responsibility applied to, nonetheless the Crown submitted, and it was accepted by Mr. Odgers, SC. for the accused, that I had to deal with the matter by way of sentence in accordance with the verdict of the jury. Both counsel opposed my taking any action under those provisions, or otherwise, and it remains for the Director and the offender to take such course as they may be advised on the verdict. 
    18   For my part, I am of the view that I am placed in a situation on sentence of the utmost artificiality. Nonetheless, I will proceed, as best I can, to undertake the required task. 
    19   I have regard to what the Crown has said in drawing my attention to what Allen, J. had said in Regina v. Cheung (CCA, unreported 11 December 1995) concerning the arrogance of those men who feel entitled to impose their will upon their partners by violence, justifying that course by a claim of some grand passion, but that is not this case. I am entitled, in having regard to the offender's mental condition, to reject the condition his Honour there refers to as being that applicable here. I am entitled, too, to have regard to the fact that the condition now established must be given some such significance as would mitigate the general deterrence and personal deterrence that might otherwise be applicable, as I understand counsels' submissions. It is not necessary for me to set out the lengthy list of authorities on these questions. 
    20   On the other hand, it is necessary to denounce the appalling conduct and to emphasise that value the law puts on human life in the sentence, particularly because I am bound by the verdict not to consider the culpability as reduced, as it might have been were manslaughter found, or the defence upheld. 
    21   In this regard the Crown has drawn my attention, in relation to the various sentences that might be imposed, to a lengthy discussion of cases in a bound volume provided to me. None of them have applicability to this situation, though they do afford some limited guide. 
    22   I gain some assistance from the course taken by Dunford, J. in Regina v. De Souza (unreported 10 November 1995), where the defence of diminished responsibility had been rejected by a jury but nonetheless the mental condition caused by the influences acting upon the accused could be taken into account by his Honour to an extent. 
    23   Having made these general remarks, I should turn to the particular circumstances of the offender. Although he has a prior criminal record commencing in 1979, when he received a recognisance for the offence of break, enter and steal, and had minor matters involving cannabis and an assault in 1981, he has had, since then, some driving, alcohol and minor summary matters but, otherwise, according to the evidence, has become a deeply religious person, who has served on his local land council, in the interests of the community generally and the local aboriginal community, notwithstanding personal circumstances in which he has apparently been under some degree of fear, and has acted entirely meritoriously within his community, except in respect of the episodes of violence against his wife. All of the evidence persuades me that he has, except in that respect, been a man of entirely estimable character. 
    24   In the chronology presented to me, Exhibit B, there are set out various of the matters of violence against his wife. They commence in 1980 with a vicious assault. In 1981 he was dealt with for a severe beating, which produced the offence in the Coolangatta Magistrate's Court to which I have referred. He punched his wife on her 21st birthday. He had punched her again during 1985 and 1986 on various occasions. In 1987 it seems that, in a particularly violent altercation, he bashed her with a belt with a belt buckle in a prolonged attack, leading to her being taken to a local hospital. She was quite severely injured. In 1995 she complained that he was asserting that she was having sex with other men, that his conduct toward her seemed bizarrely to be directed to forcing her to do that, and she was subjected again to a severe beating, again, she was attacked in November 1996, when she apparently lost two teeth. 
    25   He received the benefit of a recognisance in 1979 and, after reporting to the Probation and Parole Service for some years, was charged with the assault to which I have referred. A pre-sentence report had been prepared. That service thus had had, by the time it prepared the report for this court which has been tendered in evidence marked Exhibit C, some acquaintanceship with the offender and importantly, the officers of the service were aware of his public life subsequent to those occasions on which he had formerly come under the supervision of the service. 
    26   That report valuably points out that when he performed his community service in 1989, and subsequently, following a driving charge, he had become involved in church activities, married his wife and settled down with his family, putting away the prior period of alcohol abuse and domestic upheaval. That report sets out that the offender, who was born on 1 April 1960, came from a family where the father was a violent, heavy drinker, who abused, physically, the offender. That account shows instances of almost sadistic violence, as it was described regularly, used against the offender when he was a child. 
    27   He and his wife first met at primary school and lived together from when he was about the age of 20. Their first child was born about a year later. The report categorises their relationship as, initially, one of conflict and violence from the outset, with some degree of drinking to excess and illegal drugs. Two of the children died in appalling circumstances, putting stress upon both partners to the relationship, and to the relationship. 
    28   His account, given to the Probation and Parole Service officer after this offence, referred to a belief then of his wife's infidelity for many years and his involvement with amphetamines. He asserted then that she had told him earlier that she had been sexually abused when young. 
    29   The children are now in care and, despite his closeness to them, it is apparent that he is going to have little contact with them for many years. 
    30   His education concluded at 15 but, after his conversion, he has spent nine years as the coordinator of the local land council, chairman of the local aboriginal housing cooperative, and the material before me, in support of what is said in the Probation and Parole Service report, establishes, clearly, the value he has been to the local community. 
    31   In his public life this man was a negotiator who was able to use patience, courtesy and reason. In prison his behaviour has been said to have been excellent. He is the aboriginal prison delegate. He is the person with responsibility to seek to avoid self harm amongst aboriginal prisoners in gaol. He is said to be a person who would respond to counselling and assistance. 
    32   One can only say that, in the context that one cannot know precisely what psychological mechanisms or psychiatric conditions were operating, and what treatment this man might have, there is much to hope for by way of rehabilitation. 
    33   I am unable to conclude that the beating was itself premeditated in the usual sense this term is used. I am able to conclude that the violent conduct escalated. I am unable to conclude that this beating was out of accord with the beatings that had previously occurred, except as to its result, its severity and except by reason of that distinguishing feature of the offender's state of mind which, as I have previously said, made this episode in that respect atypical. I am certainly unable to conclude, and reject the proposition, that the offender is to be regarded as generally dangerous in that, whatever be the psychological or psychiatric mechanisms or illnesses operating, it is plain that they focused entirely upon that woman with whom he appears to have been concerned, the deceased, his wife. 
    34   In all the circumstances it is not necessary for me to analyse to any detailed extent the evidence now on sentence of Dr. Nielssen in consequence of the view to which he has now come. I do, however, observe that the accounts given, in particular by Mr. Chalk, would tend to support the proposition that, to some extent at least, the harassment the prisoner believed he was being subjected to might have some foundation in fact. But it would seem highly likely that there was as well a belief of a paranoid kind, since such harassment as he might actually have been subjected to seems to have led to a belief in harassment and in its cause which may well have been entirely delusional, or at least substantially delusional. Dr. Nielssen, having come to the conclusion that he has, however, I need go no further. 
    35   The observations of Mr. Chalk of the offender's deteriorating conduct have been entirely supported by those observations of Reginald John Lever, his older brother, which are referred to in his statement, Exhibit 6. Those observations tend to support the proposition that there was some degree of harassment in fact. 
    36   The evidence provided to me from Bob Carroll by affidavit of 14 August 2000 supports the conscientious devotion the prisoner had shown in his public life to the welfare of the Aboriginal community, and to the work he has done in the gaol, and to the role that he is occupying there. It is not necessary for me to detail, beyond referring to the evidence provided to me by Mr. Stephen Wright, Mr. Michael Wright, Senator Ridgeway, Mr. Rooney and Ms. Lever concerning these matters and which have been provided to me in a folder. 
    37   It has been submitted on the offender's behalf that the extraordinary contrast between his public persona and his private aberrance suggests that the offence must have been committed out of some disordered mind. Further, that the very facts of the offence itself and his conduct, when spoken to by the police, suggest that aberrance such that it is not appropriate for there to be the usual components of personal and general deterrence. I accept those submissions to the extent I have already referred to but remain persuaded that it is necessary, particularly in the light of the verdict of the jury, to pass a sentence which the community can regard as sufficient to meet the objective seriousness of the taking of a human life in such an appalling way. 
    38   I have concluded that there are, here, as was conceded by the Crown, special circumstances such that it is appropriate that there be a longer than normal non-parole period and a shorter than normal non-parole period. These special circumstances include the prisoner's prior circumstances, his mental condition, his prospects for rehabilitation and the length of the sentence that, in my view, would have to be passed. I have regard to the offender's prior deprived circumstances, and particularly in the context of his Aboriginality. 
    39   I note, too, that a plea of guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility was offered to the Crown shortly after the offender was charged, but was rejected, although it may well be, on the evidence as things now stand, that that plea, had there been full enquiry at the time, might well have been accepted. The Crown accepts that the offender should be dealt with as though an early plea of that kind was offered. 
    40   Having regard to those matters and to the fact that, prior to his release on bail, the offender has spent some 251 days in custody, having been in custody refused bail. This is notoriously a period of custody operating in a most onerous fashion upon a prisoner. I will, therefore, reduce the sentence that I would otherwise impose, both the non-parole period and the total sentence, in order to reflect the general effect of those days in gaol and the early offer of a plea. 
    41   He has been in custody continuously since the verdict of the jury on 30 November 1999. The sentence will date, then, from that day. The offender will be sentenced, having regard to that reduction that I have referred to, to a total sentence of 13 years imprisonment, with a non-parole term of nine years, the expiry date of which will be 29 November 2008. The first opportunity for release will therefore be 29 November 2008. There will be a parole period of four years to date from 30 November 2008, and the non-parole period will expire on 29 November 2008. 
    42   I recommend that the offender be afforded such assistance and treatment for such psychiatric or psychological condition as he may have as might be available to him.

      JUDGMENT 
      
    1   MASON P: I agree with Smart AJ. 
    2   HEYDON JA: I agree with Smart AJ. 
    3   SMART AJ: On 6 July 1998 this Court, differently constituted, upheld an appeal by Mr Olbrich against a sentence of imprisonment imposed by Howie DCJ on 20 December 1996 comprising a sentence of imprisonment of 8 ½ years commencing on 16 August 1996 with a non parole period of 6 years. The sentence dated from the day of the offence being the day on which the appellant went into custody. This Court remitted the matter to the District Court to re-sentence the applicant: (1998) 45 NSWLR 538. 
    4   On 7 October 1999 the High Court upheld an appeal by the Crown against the decision and orders of this Court and remitted the matter to this Court to be dealt with conformably with the reasons of the High Court: (1999) 73 ALJR 1550. 
    5   The appellant pleaded guilty to importing into Australia a prohibited import to which section 233B of the Customs Act 1901 applied, to wit, narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of heroin not being less than the trafficable quantity applicable to heroin. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $100,000. The trafficable quantity of heroin is 2 grams. 
    6   The appellant arrived at Mascot Airport from Thailand via Singapore with 1667.6 grams of white powder containing 1184 grams of pure heroin. The powder was secreted in some bottles and a plastic design board contained in his luggage. The ensuing narrative is taken from the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ. The Statement of Facts placed before the sentencing judge recorded that on the appellant’s arrival his luggage was searched by the Australian Customs Service and found to include some bottles containing white powder. That powder reacted positively to a test for heroin. When asked whether he had any more heroin in his bag the appellant replied “Yes, I have one more piece. I know there is some more because someone pays me $15,000.” He removed a plastic design board from his brief case. That board had heroin secreted in it. In a further conversation the appellant named a man in Perth to whom he intended to deliver the drugs. The Statement of Facts recorded that at the airport the appellant “indicated his willingness to participate in a controlled delivery of the bottles and design board.” However, due to “operational factors and considerations” a controlled delivery from Sydney to the intended destination of the drugs (Perth) was not permitted to proceed. Apparently, such a delivery at such a distance would be too difficult to manage and control and costly. The Statement of Facts concluded by recording that the appellant “is married with three children. He is a German citizen residing in Singapore with his family where he claims, he is an opal dealer. The [appellant] has no previous convictions in Australia.” 
    7   The High Court judgment refers to the appellant as the respondent as he was in that Court. The judgment continues: 
     
      
       
       “On the hearing of the plea, the respondent sought to put further facts before the primary judge. In particular, he tendered an affidavit in which he stated that he had been offered drug courier jobs previously but had refused because he disliked that activity and had no need for the money. According to the respondent’s affidavit, he learned, in about August 1996, that his son had been arrested and sentenced to detention in a boys’ home in Singapore. When in Thailand at about that time he used heroin for the first time because of the pressure and distress he was feeling. Being desperate for money he agreed to deliver the drug. But he said, in his affidavit, that at the time he agreed to do this he was not aware of the harm that using heroin would cause and that he had only realised its destructive nature after being imprisoned in Australia pending sentence. 
       
      
      
       
       Prosecuting counsel cross-examined the respondent. In his sentencing remarks the primary judge said of the respondent’s evidence, ‘I do not believe any of the evidence given by the [respondent] surrounding the circumstances of this offence by which he has sought to mitigate his involvement. His evidence was riddled with inconsistencies, prevarications, and assertions of fact which were themselves inherently unbelievable.’” 
       
      
    8   The judge rejected the submission that it was for the Crown to prove that the appellant was not a courier and had a higher degree of involvement. He held that “[t]o the degree that a courier is given some mitigation by being less culpable for that offence than if he were a principal, it seems to me that the [appellant] must prove that he is less culpable than the objective facts would otherwise indicate.”  
    9   Having rejected the appellant’s evidence the judge proceeded as if the appellant had told the police or the court nothing about the circumstances of the event. He applied “normal sentencing principles taking into account the nature of the offence, the maximum penalty and such other matters which are relevant to an assessment of the objective features of a criminal offence.” 
    10   The Court of Criminal Appeal held that the judge had erred in not accepting that the Crown bore the onus of proof beyond reasonable doubt on the issue of the appellant’s degree of involvement in the importation. The High Court did not accept that the identification of the precise nature of the accused’s involvement in an act of importation of prohibited imports is an essential aspect of the sentencing process. The High Court pointed out that frequently, “it will not be possible to say, with any certainty, what exactly was done or intended by a person apprehended in the act of importing narcotics into Australia.” 
    11   The High Court observed that in some circumstances it may be useful to use shorthand descriptions of different kinds of participation in a single enterprise of importing drugs such as couriers and principals. However, the joint judgement stressed “Further, it is always necessary, whether one or several offenders are to be dealt with in connection with a single importation of drugs, to bear steadily in mind the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced. Characterising the offender as a ‘courier’ or a ‘principal’ must not obscure the assessment of what the offender did.” 
    12   The High Court stated that there was nothing which revealed that the appellant was part of a business venture that was organised hierarchically to import drugs into Australia. It said, “All that was known was that the [appellant] asserted that he was to be paid $15,000 for importing the heroin. That is, the [appellant] asserted that the importation of such a large quantity of heroin was for his financial gain rather than for some other purpose such as his own use.” 
    13   The High Court held that if the appellant wished to have his sentence mitigated because he was a courier he bore the burden of proving that fact and failed to do so on the balance of probabilities. 
    14   The judge after noting that the appellant had supplied the name of the intended receiver of the drugs and revealed the rather simple code necessary to understand the telephone numbers in his address book against the name of this person recorded that the Crown conceded that such a person existed but had claimed privilege in relation to any other material concerning the investigation of the information given by the appellant. 
    15   The judge stated that the appellant was not to be disadvantaged by the Crown’s refusal to give the court information as to the full significance of the material which the appellant provided to the police. The judge regarded the importation as a very professional attempt especially in so far as the drug contained in the white board was concerned. The judge found that the appellant was an intelligent person and a business man with considerable experience in international air travel who knew how to try to avoid attention from the customs officers by the use of his alternative passport which disguised his numerous trips to Thailand and his declaration of some innocuous matters to give him the appearance of being a careful and scrupulously honest traveller. 
    16   The appellant was born on 1 January 1939 and was thus aged 58 years at the time of sentencing. The judge held that the main mitigating factors were the appellant’s plea of guilty and the assistance which he has given to the authorities. The judge thought that the plea of guilty should result in some mitigation of the appellant’s sentence although he did not believe that it indicated very much contrition. 
    17   The plea of guilty was indicated at a very early stage and was entered at an early date enabling a committal for sentence by the magistrate. The appellant submitted that the starting point in considering the sentence imposed should be the guideline judgment of this Court in R v Wong (1999) 48 NSWLR 340. The judge did not have the benefit of that judgment. 
    18   In that case at 366 the Chief Justice held that in respect of a high range trafficable quantity (1-1.5kgs of heroin) the appropriate sentence of imprisonment was 7 to 10 years in respect of couriers and persons low in the hierarchy of the importing organisation. Bearing in mind that quantity largely guides the length of the sentence it was submitted that any sentence imposed should be at the lower end of the range. For a quantity of (1.184grams) a sentence in the range of 8 to 8 ½ years would not be inappropriate especially as that the judge correctly regarded this importation as a serious example of this type of offence, not only because of the quantity, but because of the cunning involved in the importation. This is upon the assumption that the guideline applies. 
    19   In my opinion the guideline does not apply because the appellant was not shown to be either a courier or low in the hierarchy. Counsel endeavoured to overcome this objection by pointing to the words of the Chief Justice at 365, “The range is not intended to apply to the principal of an organisation responsible for an importation or a person high in the hierarchy of such an organisation to whom an increment should be applied.”  
    20   It was the appellant’s submission that if he were not shown to be either a principal or high in the hierarchy then the range to be applied to him was that for a courier and a person low in the hierarchy of the importing organisation. On the facts accepted by the judge it is simply not known whether the appellant was acting mainly on his own behalf or was part of an organisation. I do not accept that there has to be but one distinction, namely, between those that are high and those who are low in the organisation. In many cases, as indeed in this case, the facts may point to a significant participation in an importation without revealing the full details. 
    21   I should add one further comment. The discussion of the Chief Justice prior to enunciating the guidelines indicates that he had in mind that the range was appropriate when there was a plea of guilty. 
    22   The judge did not disclose how he arrived at the sentence imposed. There are a number of ways in which one could consider the sentence imposed and whether it was manifestly excessive. Since the offence was a Commonwealth offence a starting point would be in the order of 16 to 18 years. For present purposes a figure of 17 years could be taken. As remissions are not allowed in New South Wales, s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) applies and the sentence would be reduced to about 11 ½ years. If a further discount is allowed for assistance one could readily reach a figure of 8 ½ years as determined by the judge. It involves a discount of approximately 26%. If the starting point was a little higher then the discount for assistance would be greater. The appellant advocated a discount of at least 40% but that is too high. One in the range of 25% to 33 1/3 % would be reasonable. 
    23   An alternative way of approaching the matter applying Wong would be to take a starting point of 8 ½ years and then add on an increment to reflect the greater culpability of the appellant. That increment would result in a sentence of 11 ½ to 12 years. An appropriate discount for assistance would then bring the sentence back to about 8 ½ years. The approach to sentence is neither rigid nor mathematical. When all allowances and discounts are given the resulting sentence must still bear a relationship to the criminality involved. 
    24   Taking into account the early admissions, the early plea of guilty, the assistance to the authorities, the other subjective features and the criminality revealed by the evidence it could not be said that a head sentence of 8 ½ years was manifestly excessive. It is within the permissible range. 
    25   The next question that arises is the length of the non parole period. In Bernier (1998) 102 A Crim R 44 this Court held that the normal non parole period was in the range of about 60 to 66 2/3% of the head sentence. Bernier had not been decided when the judge imposed the sentence under appeal. The appellant’s non parole period is 70.6% of the head sentence and that head sentence was towards the top of the permissible range taking into account the criminality involved and the discounts to be allowed. 
    26   There are a number of other factors which would lead me to the view that in the present case there should be a lower non parole period. From 16 August 1996 until 31 March 1998 the appellant was classified with an A2 security rating being a maximum security rating. On 31 March 1998 he was classified with a B security rating, a medium security rating, and that took effect on 7 April 1998. 
    27   It has been explained by the Department of Corrective Services that inmates hold an A2 or B classification security rating until they have been sentenced. While they are on remand they may not progress to a minimum security rating or correctional centre.  
    28   The appellant has stated that while he has enjoyed a B classification since April 1998 he has been kept in accordance with departmental policy in a maximum security prison. This was not disputed. 
    29   The materials indicate that the appellant’s progress to a less onerous classification has been delayed by the extended appeal process and that overall the conditions of imprisonment which he has endured have been more onerous than could have been foreseen at the time of sentence. 
    30   The age of the appellant is also a factor of some significance. In the whole of the circumstances the non parole period is excessive and I would substitute a non parole period of 5 years for that imposed. 
    31   I propose the following orders: 
     
      
     1. Appeal against sentence allowed in part; 
      
      
     2. The sentence of imprisonment of 8 ½ years commencing on 16 August 1996 is confirmed; 
      
      
     3. In lieu of the non parole period of 6 years imposed by the judge the non parole period is fixed at 5 years commencing on 16 August 1996 and expiring on 15 August 2001 at which time the appellant will be eligible for release on parole. 
      
    32   The legal representatives of the appellant are to explain the effect of these orders to him.

     JUDGMENT 
    1    DUNFORD J: This is a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of concurrent sentences of two years to be served by way of periodic detention imposed on the respondent by her Honour Judge Tupman in the District Court in Sydney following his pleas of guilty to three counts of defrauding the Commonwealth contrary to the provisions of s 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), which offence carried at the time a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment or a fine of $100,000 or both. 
    2    Each of the counts related to obtaining money from the Australian Taxation Office. In relation to the first count, the respondent during the tax year 1994/1995 worked as a specialist tomato salesman at the Flemington Produce Markets for a company J B Tucker & Sons Pty Ltd which ceased trading when a liquidator was appointed in November 1995. The respondent was employed as a contract tomato salesman, not as an employee, and accordingly no tax was deducted by the company from his remuneration. Notwithstanding that, on or about 22 August 1996 the respondent submitted a taxation return for the 1995/1996 tax year which included a statutory declaration signed by him which stated that during the period from 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996 he was employed by J B Tucker & Sons Pty Ltd and that during that period he was paid a gross weekly wage of $1,346 out of which tax amounting to $472 per week had been deducted. These statements in the statutory declaration were untrue. He also in the tax return made claims for various motor vehicle and other work related expenses which her Honour likewise found were not true. 
    3    As a result of lodging this return and statutory declaration the respondent was issued with a refund cheque in the sum of $23,906.60 on or about 25 September 1996. 
    4    In relation to count 2 the respondent on 11 July 1997 submitted a further tax return for the 1996/1997 tax year which included what purported to be a group certificate showing that he was employed by J K Engraving Pty Ltd and from that company had earned a gross salary of $93,600 from which the sum of $37,799.80 had been deducted by way of tax instalments, and also specified a travelling allowance of $1,850 and a uniform allowance of $400. The tax return specified that the accused was a salesperson with that company and that he had numerous deductions arising from work related expenses. At no stage was the respondent ever employed by J K Engraving Pty Ltd in any capacity, he did not receive the income alleged in the group certificate, nor were any tax instalments deducted, other allowances paid to him, nor did he incur the expenses for which he claimed the deductions. 
    5    Her Honour found that all the relevant statements made in that group certificate were erroneous and that the group certificate itself was a forgery, although she was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent in fact played any part in the forging or creating of the certificate; but she did find that he knew it was a forgery and that he knew that none of the relevant statements in it were correct. As a result of lodging that return the respondent was issued with a refund cheque from the Australian Taxation Office in the sum of $22,466.40. 
    6    In relation to the third count, on 26 August 1998 the respondent lodged a tax return for the 1997/1998 tax year. Once again this included a forged group certificate, this time specifying that during the relevant period he had been employed by J & K Ind Engraving Pty Ltd and had earned a gross salary of $95,400 from which tax instalments of $38,525.70 had been deducted, that a lump payment of $5,750 had been paid to him and there were travel allowances of $2,970 and a uniform allowance of $500. 
    7    Once again none of the relevant statements in the group certificate were true. The respondent had never been employed by the company specified which was not, in fact, a company registered in Australia. Once again, as I say, the group certificate was a forgery but her Honour did not find that the respondent was actually involved in forging or creating it but she did find that once again, when lodging it, he knew that it was a forgery and the statements in it were false. 
    8    As a result of his filing this tax return the respondent was due to receive a refund of $17,114.09, but the matter was investigated and the refund cheque was intercepted and the cheque cancelled by the Australian Taxation Office. 
    9    The total of the three refund cheques was $63,487.13 of which the respondent personally received $46,373.04. 
    10    The respondent initially pleaded not guilty but, after five days of evidence and virtually at the end of the Crown case, he changed his pleas to guilty. Her Honour described the prosecution case as a strong one in relation to the first count and ""virtually overwhelming"" in relation to counts 2 and 3. She therefore regarded the pleas of guilty more as a recognition of reality on the part of the respondent rather than as any indication of contrition; and accordingly afforded them little weight in discounting what would otherwise be appropriate sentences; but she did have regard to them as providing certainty and avoiding the possibility of a hung jury or a perverse acquittal which could have resulted from confusion with the documentary evidence, sympathy for the respondent or even antipathy towards tax collecting agencies. 
    11    Her Honour described the offences as serious matters, not at the top of the range for such offences but not at the bottom either, and found they were committed out of greed and not need. 
    12    The respondent was at the time aged 38, married with one child from the marriage and another expected, whilst he also had two children from an earlier marriage for whom he provided financial support. 
    13    His only previous convictions had been for driving whilst disqualified and he had never been to prison. He had a record of regular work since about age 10 in the fruit and vegetable field and at the time of sentencing he was conducting a business described as a ""loans originator"". 
    14    He also has a younger brother who is intellectually disabled who lives with their mother and it was said that he provided physical and financial support to his mother in the care of the brother. 
    15    Her Honour had some doubt as to whether the respondent was fully aware of the seriousness of the offences and accordingly rated his prospects of rehabilitation as being good rather than excellent. 
    16    Her Honour referred to the Crimes Act s 16A, particularly to the impact that a full-time custodial sentence would have on his family (s 16A(2)(p)) as a result both of his absence and lack of financial support, noting that his wife would soon find it necessary to give up her paid employment at least for a time because of the impending birth of their second child, and also the impact that this full time absence would have on his intellectually disabled brother and the additional burden it would place on their mother.  
    17    This latter circumstance in particular she regarded as a special circumstance which took the case outside the normal practice that cases involving fraud on the revenue call for a full-time custodial sentence and she expressed the view that the seriousness of the offences, general and personal deterrence could all be accommodated by sentences to be served by way of periodic detention. Her Honour also made a reparation order pursuant to section 21B of the Crimes Act in the sum of $46,373.04. 
    18    We have been informed from the bar table that, apart from the first weekend, the respondent has not attended for any periodic detention but claims to have a medical condition which prevents him doing so, and the extent of this condition and the validity of his excuse for non-attendance is still apparently under consideration. He has made no payments pursuant to the reparation order. 
    19    The submission made on behalf of the Crown is that offences of this nature warrant a full-time custodial sentence and that periodic detention fails to pay sufficient regard to the seriousness of the offence and need for general deterrence.  
    20    The offences were certainly serious involving as they did repeated, deliberate, premeditated frauds on the Commonwealth with sophisticated planning, and in the case of the second and third counts the use of documents known to be forgeries containing false statements of fact. 
    21    The amounts involved, although not as large as in some other cases, were nonetheless significant and unlike most taxation fraud cases, they involved not the mere non-disclosure of income with a resultant failure to pay tax due but extracting from the Taxation Office by way of supposed 'refunds' money which had never belonged to the respondent in the first place. 
    22    The principle that generally in the case of serious offences of defrauding the revenue the element of general deterrence is of major importance and that usually such offences should receive full-time custodial sentences has been referred to in a number of cases and it is not necessary to again analyse them in detail; see R v Morris (1992) 61 A Crim R 233, R v Whitnall (1993) 120 ALR 449, R v Wright (1994) 74 A Crim R 152, R v Nguyen and Pham (1996) 86 A Crim R 521, R v Ruggero (SASC - 1 December 1998), R v Kelvin [2000] NSWCCA 190 and Director of Public Prosecutions v Hamman (CCA - 1 December 1998). Lest any attempt be made to compare the amounts involved in the present case against the amounts involved in Hamman, I should point out that Hamman was dealt with under s 29B which provides for a maximum sentence of two years as opposed to the present respondent who is being dealt with under s 29D. 
    23    In R v Stitt (1998) 102 A Crim R 428, a case with some similarities to the present, although involving larger amounts, I said at 430,  
     
      
       
       ""Fraud on the Taxation Department is a serious offence and this is even more so when it involves a sophisticated scheme such as the present to obtain from the department so-called refunds of moneys which had never been paid in the first place and where such a substantial sum of money is involved.""  
       
      
    24    It is in a very real sense not only a fraud on the Department as such but a fraud on all other taxpayers who pay what is due, and the need for general deterrence in such cases has been referred to a number of times and, although most of the cases to which I have referred have simply referred to custodial sentences, it is clear from the context that what was being referred to was full-time custodial sentences as opposed to custodial sentences to be served by way of periodic detention. This was impliedly acknowledged in R v Gentz [1999] NSWCCA 285 at para [6] and was expressly recognised by the learned sentencing Judge at p 9 of her Remarks On Sentence. A sentence of periodic detention has a strong degree of leniency built into it and, more importantly for present purposes, it is outwardly less severe in its denunciation of the offence and in its effect on general deterrence: R v Hollocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67 at 73; and in the case of serious white collar crime, it does not adequately reflect the requirement of general deterrence. 
    25    Although in relation to State offences regard cannot be had to the effect that a sentence of imprisonment may have on members of the prisoner's family except in highly exceptional circumstances: R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510, R v Day (CCA - 23 April 1998), R v Byrne (CCA - 5 August 1998), in the case of Federal offenders section 16A(2)(p) of the Act expressly requires the sentencing Court to take such matters into account, as her Honour purported to do. 
    26    However in my opinion the evidence did not justify her Honour in regarding the effect of a sentence of full-time imprisonment on the respondent's family, including his brother and mother, as justifying anything less than a sentence of full-time custody. It is not uncommon and it is a natural consequence of full-time imprisonment for families to be deprived of breadwinners, husbands and fathers. In the present case her Honour referred particularly to the effect of full-time custody on the care of the respondent's intellectually disabled and handicapped brother. There was no evidence from the respondent or from his mother as to the effect that imprisonment would have on the care of the brother, and the evidence of his sister Mrs Palumbo was extremely vague and amounted to little more than saying that he sometimes helped out with lawn mowing and other chores, but not how often or how regularly, that he sometimes paid for medicines and at other times provided financial support, although she did not know how much, and she conceded that if the respondent was interstate or overseas she would be able to assist their mother with the care of their brother. 
    27    I do not consider that this vague evidence justified departing from what her Honour acknowledged was the normal type of sentence for serious cases of fraud on the revenue, namely one of full-time custody; and the sentences of periodic detention in my view fail to contain a sufficient element of general deterrence. Futhermore, they failed to comply with the requirements of section 16A(1) of the Act which provides that in determining the sentence to be passed the Court must impose a sentence that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence. 
    28    I am therefore of the opinion that the sentences imposed in the present case are grossly inadequate. They disclose error on the part of the sentencing Judge and they call for the intervention of the Court. 
    29    As pointed out in R v Webster [1999] NSWCCA 313 by Grove J and Greg James J, with both of whom Sully J agreed, it is not sufficient for sentencing Judges to mouth a formula saying that they have had regard to sentencing principles laid down by this Court, it is necessary for them to also apply those principles, and if they do not, this Court is faced with the distasteful task of sending someone to prison some months after the sentencing process should have been completed. 
    30    As this is a Crown appeal, on account of the double jeopardy involved, this Court on re-sentencing will impose a lesser sentence that it considers should have been imposed at first instance. 
    31    Allowing for the very belated plea of guilty, for which I myself would only allow in the vicinity of five to ten per cent discount, and taking into account also, as required by s 16G of the Act the non-availability of remissions in this State, but noting also that in this case virtually none of the periodic detention has been served, I propose that the Crown appeal be allowed, that the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge be quashed and in lieu thereof on each count the respondent be sentenced to imprisonment for six months; such sentences to be concurrent, to date from today and expire on 5 April 2001. 
    32    Having regard to the length of the sentences and the provisions of s 19AC(3) it is not necessary to make a recognisance release order. I would also confirm the reparation order made by her Honour. 
    33    WOOD CJ at CL: For the reasons identified by Justice Dunford I am satisfied that the learned sentencing Judge erred in law in coming to the conclusion that exceptional or special circumstances were shown, sufficient to depart from the sentencing norm for cases of the kind now before the Court. 
    34    I recognise that the need for this Court to correct the error below has almost certainly led to an increase in the burden that the respondent will bear, beyond that which would have been occasioned had the correct sentences been imposed in the first instance. That is not an uncommon circumstance when the Crown finds it necessary to appeal against manifestly lenient sentences and that appeal is upheld. It needs to be observed again that Judges do not do any favour to persons standing for sentence by imposing sentences that are out of kilter with proper sentencing principle. That kind of sentence holds out a promise that is bound to lead to disappointment, and to an increase in uncertainty and anxiety while the inevitable appeal is awaited. 
    35    Having regard to the extent to which the sentence fell so far short of that which should have been imposed I am satisfied this is not a case calling for the exercise of the traditional discretion attaching to the Crown appeal. But for the principle of double jeopardy I would have considered a longer custodial sentence appropriate. However for the reasons identified by his Honour I agree with the orders proposed. 
    36    CARRUTHERS AJ: I also agree with the orders proposed for the reasons enunciated by Mr Justice Dunford. 
    37    WOOD CJ at CL: The orders will be as proposed by his Honour Mr Justice Dunford. 
    38    (Mr Stanton asked that the respondent be assessed for home detention. The Crown opposed the application. Discussion ensued.) 
    39    DUNFORD J: This Court having imposed concurrent sentences of 6 months imprisonment in respect of these matters, Mr Stanton, counsel for the respondent, has sought an order that the respondent be assessed as to his suitability for home detention. 
    40    It appears that the Court now has power, by virtue of s 20AB of the Crimes Act (Cth) and the amendment of the Crimes Regulations 1990 by the Crimes Amendment Regulation 2000 (No. 1) SR 99 of 2000, to order that a sentence for a federal offence be served by way of home detention. Accordingly, one is brought back to consider the provisions of s 7 and Part 6 (ss 74-83) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). 
    41    Section 7 provides that where a Court has sentenced an offender to imprisonment for not more than 18 months, it may make an order directing that the sentence be served by way of home detention, but Part 6 provides the procedure, and the restrictions on the making of such an order. 
    42    There are certain types of offences, and a certain type of offender in respect of whom such an order may not be made: ss 76 and 77, and s 78 provides that a home detention order may not be made unless the Court is satisfied of various matters, including (a) that the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of home detention, and (b) that it is appropriate in all the circumstances that the sentence be served by way of home detention, and there are other matters as well. An order may only be made if an assessment report states in that, that the offender is a suitable person for such an order: s 78(4). Section 80 provides for the referral of an offender for assessment and s 81 for the making of such assessment. 
    43    Section 7, or rather its predecessor, was considered by this Court in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209, where the nature and effect of home detention was discussed. It was held that it is a less onerous form of detention than detention in a Corrective Services institution, and that in exercising the discretion to order an assessment, the Court should take into account that the making of an order under the section will entail a significant watering down of the sentence of imprisonment, and may lead to a sentence that was not otherwise appealable, becoming appealable. 
    44    It was also held that the sentencing court has a discretion to request an assessment, and then if and when a favourable assessment has been made, a further discretion whether or not to make the order. 
    45    I also refer again to the provisions of s 78(1)(b), that one of the matters the Court must take into account in determining whether to make such an order, is whether it is appropriate, in all the circumstances, that the sentence be served by way of home detention. 
    46    This case has come to this Court on appeal, on the grounds that an order for periodic detention resulted in error on the part of the sentencing judge, and sentences which were inadequate. Having regard to the principles of double jeopardy and the other matters to which I have referred, this Court has imposed a sentence at the bottom of what it would regard as the appropriate range for these offences. To make an order for home detention would further water down the effect of the sentences, and in my view would render the sentences that this Court has just imposed, inadequate. 
    47    The general rule that people who defraud the revenue in substantial amounts should suffer full-time custodial sentences would, in my view, not be satisfied by the imposition of home detention, with the concessions that service of a sentence in such manner entails. Therefore, I would propose that this Court refuse the application to have the respondent assessed for a home detention order. 
    48    CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
    49    WOOD CJ AT CL: I also agree. The application for referral for assessment is accordingly refused. 
    50    It is appropriate to note that the prisoner appears to be in need of medical investigation. That need should be accommodated by the Department of Corrective Services. These remarks should be communicated to the Director of Health Services as soon as the respondent is admitted into custody.

      REGINA v Glen JIMENEZ 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
    1   FITZGERALD JA: The circumstances giving rise to this appeal are set out in the reasons for judgment of Smart AJ. 
    2   At the Court’s request, the Director of Public Prosecutions provided the Court with what was described as the “Education Package for Video/Audio Recordings of Search Warrants and Planned Operations” which was current at the time when heroin was allegedly found on the appellant’s person. The Director also informed the Court that there is an “updated version applicable today”. Hopefully, the present version is more precise and specific than the 1998 version. 
    3   However, the 1998 “Education Package” plainly recognised the need for police officers to avoid problems such as that which has arisen on this occasion. The first page commenced with the following paragraphs: 
     
      
       
       “The execution of search warrants has been identified by the commissioner, in his reform of the NSW Police Service Phase One document, as a high risk area for police corruption. He has specifically mentioned the Video Recording of Search Warrants in the Phase One Reform Agenda, in point 115. 
       
      
      
       
       As a result, Standing Operating Procedures for the Video/Audio Recording of Search Warrants and Planned Operations have been developed. These SOP’s represent a comprehensive best practice guideline outlining duties and responsibilities for video operators. 
       
      
      
       
       …” 
       
      
    4   In the Introduction section of the “Education Package”, attention is drawn to point 115 in the Phase One Reform Agenda, which it is said requires that “..by the 1st January, 1997, practice and procedure guidelines be developed for audio/video recording of the execution of search warrants.” The following paragraph reiterates that Standard Operating Procedures “addressed this reform by providing a comprehensive best practice guideline outlining duties and responsibilities for video operators.”  
    5   The first page in the section of the Education Package headed “Standing Operating Procedures” contains the following “Statement of Principle”: 
     
      
       
       “The searching of premises and the seizure of property/exhibits is a high risk policing function, considering the opportunities and temptations police face when locating stolen goods, illicit drugs and/or money. From time to time, the credibility and integrity of police actions have been questioned. 
        
        
       As part of the continuing commitment of this Service to improve professionalism and personal accountability.  
       Standing Operating Procedures for the Execution of Search Warrants 
        have been developed. 
        
        
       It is during the execution of search warrants that video recording provides the most reliable account of what occurred and serves as an additional valuable tool to eliminate both corruption and unjustified complaints. For this reason  
       Standing Operating Procedures (SPO’s) for Video/Audio Recording of Search Warrants and Planned Operations 
        have been developed. 
        
        
       These standing operating procedures for video/audio recording of search warrants and planned operations, with emphasis on the seizure of property/exhibits, are intended as a guide. They can and should be enhanced as appropriate depending upon the type of search and or operation involved.” 
        
       
      
    6   The next section, headed “General,” commences with a note directing that the following Standard Operating Procedures “be read in conjunction with those relating to the execution of search warrants. ….” The Standard Operating Procedures then given include the following: 
     
      
       
       “….. 
        
        
       …. The purpose of the video camera is to give a “moving picture” following the location of property until its recording and, where practical, the storage of the exhibit in an exhibit bag. 
        
        
       The video camera should record the location of items found through to the recording of those items. This includes, weighing drugs and counting money etc. 
        
        
       …. 
        
        
       …. 
        
       Sufficient batteries should be on hand to ensure the type of recording required can be completed. 
        
        
       Unfavourable inferences can be drawn at court if the recording is stopped before a job is complete or at a crucial moment. The excuse that “the batteries were flat” is hardly professional.” 
        
       
      
    7   The evidence given by the police officers against the present appellant must be read against the background of the Police Services’ directions to police officers contained in the Education Package. Further, although the punishment of those guilty of serious offences such as the supply of heroin is important, it is now understood that the protection of accused persons from the risk of false evidence from police officers is critical to the administration of justice and serves the interests of the community and the Police Service in addition to those of the accused. When police officers follow unsatisfactory procedures, police evidence implicating an accused person and attempting to explain why unsatisfactory procedures were followed must be sceptically scrutinised. It is impermissible to proceed on an assumption that the police would not fabricate evidence or, at worst, only do so if an accused is guilty. The criminal justice system entitles accused persons, not police officers, to the benefit of any reasonable doubt. 
    8   Although the jury saw and heard the witnesses and had the primary responsibility for determining the appellant’s guilt or innocence, this Court is required to set aside a conviction based on the jury’s verdict if the Court is satisfied that a reasonable jury ought to have experienced a reasonable doubt which could not have been resolved by reference to the demeanour of the prosecution witnesses. Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 6(1). Jones v R (1997) 191 CLR 439, 451. 
    9   These principles are easier to state than to apply in practice. Extreme deference is paid to the verdict of a properly instructed jury, and the appellant accepts that the jury was correctly instructed in this case. On the other hand, it is legitimate to have regard to the opinion of other judges. Smart AJ is satisfied that the jury should have had a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt. That was plainly also the opinion of the trial judge, who, like the jury, saw and heard the witnesses. Smart AJ has drawn attention to some of her Honour’s remarks. In addition, her Honour gave a formal certificate that this was a fit case for an appeal by the appellant against his conviction on the ground that “[t]here is a serious question of fact which needs review.”  
    10   Whether or not the appellant is guilty, I am persuaded that, having regard to the unsatisfactory aspects of the prosecution evidence, the jury should have had a reasonable doubt about his guilt. 
    11   Accordingly, I agree with the orders proposed by Smart AJ. 
    12   SMART AJ: Glen Jimenez appeals against his conviction of supplying a prohibited drug namely heroin (48.6 grams) on 25 November 1998. That quantity was allegedly found on the appellant’s person. The Crown case was one of deemed supply. The appellant challenges the jury’s verdict on the ground that it was unreasonable and that the jury should have entertained a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. The trial judge was critical of the conduct of the police and the excuses which they gave for their shortcomings. She thought that there was much force in the argument that the police had “fitted up” the appellant with the drugs allegedly found upon him. 
    13   The police were conducting a controlled operation, the target of which was Harold Brett Goodsell. About 2.30pm on 25 November 1998 Senior Constable Bell obtained a search warrant from a magistrate permitting the police to enter and search Goodsell’s premises at unit 63/103 Victoria Street, Potts Point. He was suspected of dealing in and supplying heroin and the police wished to search his unit for heroin. 
    14   The appellant stated that he had known Goodsell for some time. During the latter part of the afternoon he went to Goodsell’s unit to buy some heroin which he had been using. The appellant said that while at the unit he had smoked some of Goodsell’s heroin and chatted. He had a couple of smokes. Goodsell left the unit to buy some ice creams. The appellant remained in the unit and dozed. At that stage the appellant had not purchased or taken delivery of any heroin. He had $200 and wished to purchase for $160 two small amounts of heroin which Goodsell usually sold in small balloons. No transaction had taken place prior to Goodsell leaving the unit and his subsequent arrest. 
    15   About 5.50pm Goodsell was arrested in Hugh Street, Potts Point. Bell handed the search warrant to Detective Sergeant Maricic. Bell and Snr Constable Luck escorted Goodsell to the Kings Cross police station. Shortly after 6pm Maricic accompanied by Senior Constables Lindwall, Spencer and Stace and Constable Langthorne attended at the unit. Prior to entering the unit the police knocked loudly on the door and called out. There was a delay of a minute or so before the door was opened.  
    16   Present in the unit were the appellant and a lady known as Lizette Reveco. According to the police when they entered the flat the appellant was in the bathroom washing his face. Some officers thought he was perspiring profusely around the head. 
    17   The appellant was asked by Stace to come into the lounge room. He was escorted there and seated on a lounge. Senior Constable Reynolds told the appellant that they were just waiting for the independent police officer to arrive. Spencer had a video recorder. 
    18   Shortly before 6.30pm Bell, Luck, Goodsell and Sergeant Ford (Acting Inspector) entered the unit. Ford was not part of the drug team. His task was to observe what took place and receive any complaints. Bell served the occupiers’ notice of the search warrant upon Goodsell and that was recorded by the video machine. Spencer then made a video recording of the condition of the entire premises prior to the commencement of a search. 
    19   While the video record was being made Lindwall moved over to the bathroom door near to the appellant. According to Lindwall the appellant said that he was feeling sick and needed to vomit. Lindwall alleged that he noticed that the appellant was sweating and had a distressed look.  
    20   Lindwall asked the appellant to wait until the video filming was finished. A few minutes later the appellant stated that he needed to be sick. Lindwall called Maricic over and the appellant insisted that he needed to go to the toilet as he felt like being sick.  
    21   Lindwall and Maricic said that they escorted the appellant to the bathroom. Maricic placed a plug in the basin and told the appellant to be sick there. The appellant stood poised over the basin for a few seconds and then straightened up.  
    22   Both Lindwall and Maricic asserted that they noticed that the appellant’s right-hand went to the front of his jeans. Lindwall stated that he told the appellant to keep his hands out of his pockets. Lindwall claimed that he noticed at this time that the top button on the appellants jeans was undone. Lindwall stated that he took hold of the appellant turned him away from the basin and told him that he was going to be searched. Lindwall asserted that he asked the appellant if he had anything on him that he shouldn't have and that the appellant said, “No.” 
    23   Lindwall stated that he removed an amount of crunched up toilet paper from the appellant's left hand jeans pocket and $200 in cash from the appellant's right-hand jeans pocket. In his statement made on 27 November 1998 Lindwall made no reference to Spencer coming to or into the bathroom to film the money. The impression created by the statement is that Spencer was called into the bathroom later and that all filming took place later, that is, after two balloons containing heroin found on the appellant’s person were removed. When Lindwall was asked in cross examination why he made no reference in his statement to the filming of the money he stated that he did not have access to the video when he made his statement. It is not easy to accept that Lindwall would forget the filming of the money as the money was the first item found and the appellant was asked to count it in front of the camera. The statement was made two days after the incident. 
    24   Spencer said that after making a sweep with the camera of the premises his attention was drawn to the bathroom. He believed that one of the police in the bathroom called him to the bathroom. In his statement Spencer made no reference to the finding of the money and the filming of the $20 notes, his withdrawal from the bathroom area into the remainder of the unit and his subsequent return to the bathroom area at Maricic’s behest to film the two balloons. His account of watching the search does not fit well with evidence of the other witnesses as to his position in the flat and being called to the bathroom area. He recalled Lindwall placing a pair of latex gloves on his hands, opening the fly of the appellant’s trousers, placing his hands inside the appellant’s underpants and subsequently holding 2 balloons. 
    25   Maricic stated that after the appellant had entered the bathroom and moved his right hand to the front of his jeans Lindwall told him that he (Lindwall) was going to search him and asked if he had anything on him which he shouldn’t have. The appellant said “No”. Lindwall commenced to search the appellant and removed $200 from his pocket. At that stage, according to Maricic, Spencer entered the bathroom by co-incidence. Maricic asserted that he had not directed or called for Spencer. He had just walked into the bathroom. On Spencer entering the bathroom Maricic said that it was 6.47pm. The ensuing conversation was recorded as was the counting of $200. 
    26   Maricic stated that after the counting of the $200 and the conversation Spencer left the bathroom and the video camera was switched off. 
    27   Lindwall stated that he told the appellant that he was going to search down the front of the appellant’s pants. Lindwall, who was wearing latex gloves, at this stage, said that he undid the fly of the appellant’s jeans and pulled out his underpants. 
    28   Lindwall stated that he noticed a large green balloon wrapped item, that he asked the appellant what was down the front of his pants but the appellant did not reply. Lindwall said that he placed his hands inside the appellant's underpants and removed a large green coloured balloon containing a rock like substance. Lindwall said that he next removed from inside the appellant’s underpants a large white balloon wrapped item also containing a rock like substance and showed them to Maricic. Maricic gave evidence to the same effect. Upon Lindwall removing the green balloon Maricic asserted that he said to the appellant, “How did that get there?” and the appellant replied “I don’t know.” 
    29   Both Lindwall and Maricic stated that after the white balloon wrapped item was seized Maricic went to the bathroom door and called out to Spencer to come in and video the items located. He did so. Maricic said that he said to the appellant “The video has just been turned back on.” The appellant was placed under arrest and cautioned. This was recorded. Spencer then left the bathroom area. 
    30   A strip search of the appellant took place. Maricic stated that he then had a conversation with Spencer and he entered the bathroom with the video camera. Maricic stated that he said, “The video is now back on. Prior to the video being switched on, whilst a proper strip search was being conducted of Mr Jimenez, Detective Bell remarked, ‘I think that’s rock’ and Mr Jimenez indicated, ‘Yeah, that one’s rock.’ Mr Jimenez said, ‘No, I didn’t, I didn’t say anything.’” This conversation was recorded. 
    31   An unusual situation has arisen. The video recording camera was available in the flat. Lindwall had stated his intention to search the appellant. Lindwall and Maricic were suspicious that the appellant had some drugs on his person. There was plenty of time and opportunity to place the appellant in a position where the search could be filmed and to have Spencer film the search. At that stage the searching of the appellant was an important, if not the most important, aspect of the police entry and search. Despite all this, the search of the appellant was not filmed. Events of obviously less importance had been filmed. Curiously, after the items wrapped in the balloons are alleged to have been recovered from the appellant they were filmed. The police unit carrying out the entry and search was the Kings Cross Drug Unit and the officers involved were experienced. 
    32   In cross examination Maricic confirmed that Spencer was not present while the critical search was undertaken and the two balloon wrapped items were allegedly removed from within the underpants of the appellant. Maricic also agreed that after Lindwall had pulled out the appellant’s underpants and asked him “What have you got in your pants?” he could have held up the search for a moment or so while he had Spencer come back into the bathroom with his video camera and film the search. However, Maricic protested that this was with hindsight and denied that he and Lindwall had “loaded up” the appellant with the balloons. Maricic conceded that he had been instructed to use video cameras to avoid disputes as to what had occurred. Maricic denied that the bathroom door was ever closed. 
    33   Maricic, as the officer in charge of the operation, stated in his evidence in reply that he was unable to give any explanation as to why he did not ask Spencer to come in and film the actual search by Lindwall. 
    34   Bell, who made his statement on 30 November 1998, said that he saw Maricic and Lindwall escort the appellant to the bathroom and that a short time later he (Bell) walked to the bathroom. He heard Lindwall say to the appellant “Glen, I’m going to search you…” Bell stated that he saw Lindwall locate $200 in the appellant’s right hand jeans pocket and heard Maricic call for Spencer to enter the bathroom. As Spencer did so, Bell left. Bell stated that a short time later he again entered the bathroom and saw Lindwall holding a green balloon and a white balloon. He noticed that Spencer was filming with the video camera and that Maricic was holding a recorded conversation with the appellant. Bell did not suggest that he had seen the search. 
    35   Reynolds, who made his statement on 5 December 1998, said that he walked to the entrance of the bathroom about a minute after the appellant was escorted there by Maricic and Lindwall. Reynolds stated that he saw Lindwall searching the appellant including undoing the all button fly and looking down the appellant’s underpants. He heard the appellant state that there was nothing down the front of his pants and Lindwall state that he was going to place his hand down the front of appellant's underpants and remove the item down there.  
    36   Reynolds stated that he saw Lindwall open the top of the appellant’s underpants, place his hand down the front of such underpants and remove a large green coloured blue wrapped item. He asserted that Lindwall again placed his hand down inside the appellant's underpants and removed a white coloured blue wrapped item. Reynolds said that Maricic then called for Spencer to video the items located. Reynolds stated that he then left the bathroom area. Reynolds could not recall anything about the finding of any money. He did not recall any conversation about money. He could not recall Spencer filming the counting of some money by the appellant. He was unable to pinpoint the movements and positions of Spencer at any given time. He could not remember the sources on which he drew to make his statement. He would have talked to other officers. 
    37   Ford, who did not make his statement until 14 October 1999 and relied on the notes he made on the Independent Officer’s form, stated that after the appellant, Maricic and Lindwall went into the bathroom he stood adjacent to the bathroom door and saw that the appellant was being searched. Ford stated that Spencer was video recording what was taking place and he (Ford) was looking over his shoulder. Ford said that he saw that the appellant was holding something in his hands which he believed to be money and that he then returned to the lounge room. Spencer also moved away from the bathroom. Ford then heard Maricic call out something. He said that both he and Spencer walked over to the bathroom and Sergeant Maricic told him of finding drugs in the appellant's underpants.  
    38   Ford said that Spencer filmed Lindwall holding two balloons, one in each hand. A short time later Lindwall conducted a full strip search of the appellant. 
    39   Luck, who made his statement on 28 November 1998, said that shortly after Bell had explained the details of the search warrant he saw Lindwall, Maricic and the appellant leave the lounge area and walk into the bathroom. The door was closed. Spencer was over near the kitchen area of the unit and not using the video camera at that point of time. A short time later Lindwall opened the door and spoke to Spencer who walked into the bathroom area with the video camera. Luck believed that the bathroom door was closed again but he could not be “a hundred per cent sure.” After several minutes Lindwall came out of the bathroom along with Maricic and the appellant. Lindwall handed Stace two balloons, one of which was green and the other was white. 
    40   The items allegedly located in the appellant’s underpants were subsequently examined for the presence of fingerprints but no identifiable fingerprints were located. If the appellant had placed the balloons containing heroin in his underpants there is at least an even chance that he would have done so with his bare hands. Lindwall was wearing latex gloves. It is possible that even if the appellant had used his bare hands that an identifiable fingerprint was not obtained on the balloons. 
    41   The appellant, who gave evidence, did not dispute that he was present in the flat at the time of the execution of the warrant. I have earlier summarised his account of the events of the afternoon after he arrived at Goodsell’s flat and prior to Goodsell leaving the flat at 5.30pm. The appellant said that after smoking heroin he became a little fuzzy in the head, just wanted to sit down and felt very relaxed. He dozed off. The knocking on the door woke him up and he went to the bathroom and washed his face and hands. This was to help him wake up. He said that when he went to the flat he did not have either a green or a white balloon containing heroin. Nor did he take possession of such balloons at the flat. 
    42   A police officer had come into the bathroom and asked him to come outside. He was escorted from the bathroom. He sat down in the lounge room. He was asked by Maricic what he was doing there and who he was waiting for. He was not a heavy user and had just started to use so that his body was not adjusted to heroin consumption. He said that he was feeling queasy and asked if he could go to the bathroom with one of the officers, probably Lindwall. He told the appellant to wait. After the premises had been filmed he was escorted by Maricic and Lindwall to the toilet. A plug was put in the basin and he was told that if he wanted to be sick to do so in the basin. For a very short period he hovered over the basin but was not sick. 
    43   The appellant denied that he made any movement towards the front of his jeans or towards the toilet. He said that Maricic asked him if he had anything in his pockets, that he replied “yes” and pulled out, inter alia, $200 cash. The appellant conceded that it could have been Lindwall who located the money. He was asked by Maricic to count the money out in front of the camera. He observed the officer with the camera standing near the door at the entrance to the bathroom filming. Then he and another police officer left. 
    44   The appellant said that he, Maricic and Lindwall were facing the doorway. Maricic was in front of him and Lindwall was behind him. He was moved further into the bathroom. Lindwall spun the appellant around so that he had his back to the bathroom doorway. At this point he could only see Lindwall. They said, “We’re going to search you.” They asked him numerous times if he had anything on him that he should not have. He replied in the negative. Lindwall asked him to hold his shirt up and undid the fly of his jeans and pulled his underpants out. With his shirt held up this blocked the appellant’s view of Lindwall’s hands. The appellant could not see what Lindwall was doing with his hands with respect to the appellant’s underpants. Then Lindwall let go of his underpants and told Maricic that he had found something. By that point of time the appellant had dropped his shirt. Lindwall held up two balloons. He believed that it was Maricic who called out. Suddenly, two or three other police officers entered the bathroom. The officer with the camera turned up a little later. Maricic endeavoured to question the appellant but the appellant told him that he (the appellant) did not wish to say anything. He was strip searched. He denied that he said anything about the contents of the balloons. 
    45   In cross examination the appellant denied that Lindwall placed his hands inside the appellant’s underpants at some stage. He said that Lindwall asked him to put his shirt down and that that was when he saw the balloons in his right hand. The appellant said that he did not realise when Lindwall produced the balloons that it was going to be suggested that he had a large quantity of heroin upon his person. He did not know what was in the balloons. He agreed that it crossed his mind in the bathroom that the police might suggest that there was heroin in the balloons. He agreed that it was clear to him that the police were loading him up with something probably a prohibited drug. The appellant agreed that he was shocked and outraged. He was shown the video. He said that he was in a state of confusion and more scared than outraged. He felt powerless. 
    46   The Crown Prosecutor tried to make considerable capital out of the appellant having exercised his right to silence, not complaining to Ford, not controverting what Maricic said (except as to the alleged admission as to rock), being polite to him and not looking outraged or sufficiently outraged on the video film. The appellant said he was not prepared to stand up for himself. 
    47   It was pointed out that the appellant did controvert the police allegation that he had said there was rock in the balloons. However, that was in the context of the police trying to extract on video an admission from him that he had said words to that effect. 
    48   The appellant was in a position of considerable disadvantage at the flat. There were a considerable number of police officers present there, that is, about nine of them. Goodsell was under arrest and the appellant had only met the lady that afternoon. The appellant, indeed most citizens, would have felt overwhelmed in the situation. It is quite unrealistic to expect the appellant to make complaints to Ford. He regarded him as another police officer and not a source of comfort or independence. To describe Ford as an independent police officer does not advance matters. Nor could the appellant be expected to confront Maricic or Lindwall having regard to what the appellant alleged and the presence of so many police officers in the relatively small flat. When the members of the court viewed the video they did not think that any useful assistance could be gained from the appellant’s demeanour as shown on the film. Some of the questions in cross examination did not sit easily with the appellant’s right to silence. 
    49   Under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 the Court of Criminal Appeal is required to set aside a conviction if it is of the opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the basis that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported on the evidence. This has led to the formulation of the question whether the court thought, that, upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty: M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 per the majority (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ). In Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 451 after referring to this question as propounded in M Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said: 
     
      
       
       “The majority emphasised, however, that it was not the function of the court to answer that question merely by examining the transcript of evidence and the exhibits. Their Honours said that: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       The majority judges explained the application of the test as follows: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.” 
         
        
       
      
      
     This court must make its own independent assessment of both the sufficiency and quality of the evidence. 
      
    50   The Crown case has a number of unsatisfactory aspects. The most important one is the absence of a video record of the search of the appellant at the flat. It was the search of the person of the appellant which was alleged to have yielded up the 2 balloons containing heroin. The absence of such a record is very hard to accept when an officer had filmed the counting of $200 - found on the appellant, a matter of little, if any, significance. It seems that the officer just stood by while the critical search took place. Lindwall and Maricic had determined that a body search was to take place. Neither Maricic nor Lindwall instructed the officer with the camera to film the search even when the fly on the appellant’s jeans had been undone, his underpants had been pulled out and Lindwall and Maricic believed there were items in the appellant’s underpants. In the context, the suspicion was of illicit drugs. For arrangements not to be made to film the search when the video camera was in the flat in such circumstances is surprising. Such a failure raises questions as to what was happening especially when the police were experienced and members of the Drug Unit. 
    51   Feelings and opinions of unease and doubt are further compounded when some of the officers advance unconvincing excuses for the failure. Lindwall’s suggestion that the reason for not filming the critical search was that it would be an invasion of the appellant’s privacy is precious. He then tried to justify not filming the search by saying that after the search of the appellant’s underpants it was intended to strip search him. Later in cross examination he advanced as one reason the need to avoid running out of batteries. As the critical search occurred early in the police search and it was obviously important this reason lacked validity. At about the time of the critical search Lindwall seemed to agree that there were five police officers in the bathroom (Maricic, Spencer, Bell, Stace and himself) as well as the appellant. It may be that this was immediately before the critical search. The evidence on this point is not entirely clear. 
    52   In his statement, Spencer claimed to have stood at the bathroom door while Lindwall stood directly in front of the appellant with Maricic nearby. Spencer said that he heard Lindwall say, “Glen, I’m going to search down the front of your pants okay.” He said that Lindwall placed a pair of latex gloves on his hands (at that time), undid the appellant’s fly, pulled it open and said, “What’s down the front of your pants?” The appellant replied, “Nothing”. Lindwall said, “I’m going to place my hand down the front of your underpants and remove the item that is down the front of your pants, okay.” 
    53   Spencer asserted “Lindwall appeared, from where I was standing to place his right hand down the front of the accused’s underpants whilst holding the underpants out with his left hand … Lindwall removed his right hand and I saw that he was holding a medium sized green balloon which appeared to contain an object.” Spencer said that after transferring that balloon to his left hand … “Lindwall placed his right hand inside the defendant’s underpants and removed a medium sized white balloon which appeared to contain an object … Lindwall … showed [the balloons] to … Maricic, I activated the video recorder and commenced recording … I made a close up recording of these items. I continued recording as … Maricic spoke to the defendant.” 
    54   When Spencer was pressed as to why he had not activated the video recorder when the body search commenced he back-peddled and gave a number of excuses. He said that he did not activate the video recorder when Lindwall said that he was going to place his hand down the front of the appellant’s underpants and remove the item “Because we don’t leave the camera recording at all times, only when items are located” and “Because the purpose of the recorder is to video any items located in situ, it is not to record the entire search.” He referred to the constraints imposed by batteries and the restraints of the tapes. Spencer agreed that he suspected that Lindwall might find something. He agreed that his investigative mind was “twigged” when Lindwall asked the appellant what was down the front of his trousers. 
    55   When pressed further as to why he had not activated the video Spencer said that he could not see the front of the appellant’s underpants from where he (Spencer) was. The appellant was a little bit askew. Spencer claimed that he could not film Lindwall removing the green balloon from down the front of the appellant’s underpants from where he (Spencer) was. Spencer said that he could not see Lindwall’s hand going down the front of the appellant’s underpants. He assumed that from what he had heard Lindwall state. Spencer did not film when Lindwall first produced and held up the green balloon. Spencer does not appear to have asked Maricic or Lindwall to put the appellant in a position where the critical part of the search could be filmed. The material in Spencer’s statement as to what he apparently saw was heavily qualified by him in cross examination to such an extent that the impression created by his statement is misleading. 
    56   Spencer said later, that it would have been difficult to get into position to film the search. He advanced two further reasons, concern about the safety of the officers and privacy. These excuses lacked substance. 
    57   The appellant relied on what were claimed to be serious inconsistencies in the Crown case. I have already touched upon those relating to the search of the appellant’s person and the filming of that search. The point whether the top button of the appellant’s jeans was undone and that could be seen is not one of sufficient moment to cause any qualms about the verdict. Of more substance is the failure of Lindwall and Spencer to make any mention in their statements of the appellant’s alleged admission that the substance in the balloons or one balloon was “rock”. Lindwall’s explanation for the omission, namely that the conversation was jut a comment between Bell and Stace is hard to accept when it is alleged that the comment was adopted by the appellant. Of itself this is not of great consequence especially as the appellant denies making the statement alleged or any admission. 
    58   The appellant relied on the irrationality of him having the drugs on his person when he had the opportunity to dispose of them prior to the police entering the flat. The heroin had a significant value especially if mixed with other substances to increase its bulk. The street value when so mixed was quite substantial. Its wholesale value is unknown. Any drug operative would be reluctant to lose about 48 grams of heroin. 
    59   The appellant also relied on the absence of fingerprints on the balloons. While this is a point worth making it is not decisive. There could be a number of explanations. It is, however, true that there is no independent corroboration of the police case in a situation where serious questions arise as to it. 
    60   In her summing up the judge gave various standard directions of law and explained the elements of the offence. She outlined the case for the Crown and the case for the appellant. She highlighted the importance of the search of the appellant’s person. At SU 11-12 she said: 
     
      
       
       “Before you can find the accused guilty in this case you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the two balloons of heroin were in fact found in the accused’s underpants by the police officers as they allege. You are not asked to make a choice between the police officers and the accused as to whose version you prefer. The Crown must satisfy you that the police are telling the truth. In order to establish that fact beyond reasonable doubt, the Crown must eliminate any reasonable doubt which the version given by the accused may have raised in your minds. You must approach this evidence of the police officers that the drugs were found on the accused with caution because the circumstances in which the drugs were said to have been found by them may make that evidence unreliable. I do not say that the circumstances must make the evidence unreliable. That is a matter for you and not for me to decide. It is for you and not me to decide whether any evidence is reliable or not. My task is no more than to warn you of the possibility that such evidence may be unreliable and to explain why that is so to enable you to exercise the caution which is required in determining whether to accept that evidence and what weight is given to it.” 
       
      
    61   The judge explained why the police evidence may be unreliable mentioning the absence of any electronic record of the critical part of the search, the presence of the police officers, the absence of any independent person and the isolation of the appellant. She pointed out that the police were trained witnesses. She explained that in all the circumstances which prevailed it was easier for the police to fabricate their evidence than for the appellant to have evidence available to challenge what they have said: 
    62   At SU 15 the judge said: 
     
      
       
       “You must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did have the drugs on his person, as the police officers have said before, you can take that into account as establishing that the accused is guilty of this charge. In deciding that issue, you must keep in mind the warning which I gave you, that is about the circumstances in which the search was conducted and you must approach the evidence of the police officers on this issue with caution because it may be unreliable. 
       
      
      
       
       If, after considering the warning and the other arguments which have been put before you, you are nevertheless convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the drugs in his underpants as alleged by the police officers, then you should take that into account in determining whether the accused had in his possession the balloons which were shown to contain drugs.” 
       
      
    63   While the judge outlined the contentions of both parties and referred briefly to the facts she did not discuss the evidence in any detail. The trial extended over five days and the factual issues emerged clearly enough from the cross examination of the police officers. 
    64   No complaint was made of the Summing Up which was balanced and fair. It has caused me to hesitate about and reflect upon intervening. 
    65   In her remarks upon sentence the judge said: 
     
      
       
       “Although the search was being video taped there was no filming of the incident in which the heroin was found in the prisoner’s trousers. The evidence of the officers concerned as to why it was not filmed was in my view quite unsatisfactory. Equally the evidence of the officer charged with the filming of the search was at variance with the other officers engaged in the search to the extent that the officer charged with filming said that he was present in the bathroom when the drugs were found and the other officers all said that he was not present but was called into the bathroom after the drugs had been found. 
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner maintained throughout the trial that the drugs were not in his trousers but that he was “fitted up” by the police. There is, in my view, much force in the argument. Nonetheless the prisoner was convicted by the jury and falls to be sentenced accordingly.” 
        
       
      
    66   These are important observations. It is apparent that the judge had considerable doubt whether the conviction was correct. In the whole of the circumstances it was not reasonably open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant. The evidence as to the non-filming of the search of the appellant’s person was unsatisfactory. The excuses advanced to justify such non filming lacked weight. The video camera was available in the flat and used to record minor matters but not what mattered. No good reason was advanced for taking such a course. The need to film the critical part of the search was obvious to all. The purpose of having a video camera at any search is to avoid disputes. My grave doubts are strengthened by the inconsistencies in the Crown evidence as to the search and the filming. 
    67   In the whole of the circumstances I have a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant and the jury should also have had a reasonable doubt. The conviction cannot stand. As a consequence the Crown appeal against sentence fails. 
    68   I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
       a) Appeal against conviction allowed; conviction and sentence quashed; 
       
      
      
       
       b) Enter a verdict of acquittal on the charge of supplying a prohibited drug (heroin) on 25 November 1998; 
       
      
      
       
       c) Crown Appeal against sentence dismissed. 
       
      
    69   IRELAND AJ: I agree with the judgment and orders of Smart AJ and with the additional remarks of Fitzgerald JA.

     REGINA v Bernice Kaye HOWE @ Bernice Kaye McGOVERN  
     
     
      
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1    CARRUTHERS AJ: On 19 May 2000, the respondent Bernice Kaye Howe, who is also known as Bernice Kaye McGovern, was convicted and sentenced in the District Court by his Honour Judge Goldring following a plea of guilty to three counts of defrauding the Commonwealth, contrary to the provisions of section 29D of the Crimes Act (1914) (Cwth) (‘the Act’). 
     
      
    2    The Crown appeals against the sentences imposed by his Honour. The respondent's legal representative was notified by letter dated 25 May 2000 that the Crown was considering an appeal. The notice of appeal was filed on 14 June 2000. 
     
      
    3    The respondent had, on 25 February 2000, pleaded guilty before a magistrate and been committed for sentence pursuant to section 51 A of the Justices Act. 
     
      
    4    The charges were each described to be of a “rolled up nature”, which encompassed fraudulent activity spanning a little over 12 years, during which time the respondent obtained a Widow's Pension, and then a sole Parent Pension and Family Allowance/Family Payment from the Department of Social Security/Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, to which the respondent was not entitled because she was, at all relevant times, in employment. 
     
      
    5    I note that the respondent was not in fact a ""widow"", but was divorced from her husband in about 1986, but nothing turns on this fact. 
     
      
    6    The maximum penalty in respect of each offence was ten years imprisonment or a fine of $100,000 or both, except for the period on and after 7 April 1997 (the last seven months of the period in charges 2 and 3) when the fine component was increased to $110,000 by the amendment of section 4 AA, the penalty unit section of the Act. 
     
      
       
      In sentencing the respondent, his Honour said; 
       
       
        
        ""Ms Howe is convicted of the offences. I make a reparation order in the sum of $115,118.40. She is sentenced to imprisonment for twelve months, and I order that this sentence be served by way of periodic detention at the Parramatta Periodic Detention Centre. Such sentence is to commence no later than 2 June 2000 and the prisoner is to report at such centre."" 
        
       
       
      
    7    His Honour used that formula to comply with the decision of this Court in Wegener [1999] NSWCCA 405 (8 December 1999), and consistently with the provisions of the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Act, as amended by the Periodic Detention of Prisoners Amendment Act No 43 of 1998. 
     
      
    8    Section 5 of the primary Act as amended provides, in effect that the sentence of imprisonment should be determined first, and only then should consideration be given to whether the person should serve the sentence in full-time imprisonment or by way of periodic detention. His Honour thus fixed the sentence of imprisonment to be one year, and then ordered that that sentence be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    9    Although his Honour did not specify that each sentence was to be served concurrently - see section 19 of the Act - that was undoubtedly his intention. 
     
      
    10    The offences were committed over a period, firstly, in relation to the Widow’s pension from 13 June 1985 to 28 May 1987. Secondly, in relation to the Widow’s and Sole Parent Pension over the period 6 August 1987 to 3 August 1997, and thirdly, in relation to the Family Allowance and the Family Payment, over the period from 7 January 1993 to 20 November 1997. 
     
      
    11    At the date of sentence, the District Court was informed that $2,088.77 had been recovered by way of garnishee from the respondent's income, leaving the amount outstanding in respect of which the reparation order was made. 
     
      
    12    The fraud was facilitated by the fact that the respondent received the pension in her married name of Howe, whereas she was employed, at all relevant times, under her maiden name of McGovern. As the statement of facts tendered on sentence indicated, during the period that the respondent was in receipt of the Widow’s Pension, she failed to notify the relevant authority that she was employed and in receipt of income. During the period that the respondent was in receipt of the Sole Parent Pension, she was required to lodge a Sole Parent Review Form every twelve weeks. On each form there was a question which asked, ""Did you do any paid work during the last twelve weeks?"", or a question to similar effect. In 43 of the 44 forms which had been retained by the Department, the respondent falsely answered ""no"" to that question. In one form she failed to answer the question. 
     
      
    13    It is not necessary, for present purposes, to refer to the long line of authority commencing with Van Tang Luu (an unreported decision of this Court of 7 December 1984) in which it has been held that general deterrence is a predominant consideration when sentencing for offences of defrauding the revenue, and that a sentence of full-time custody is required unless there are very special circumstances or, as is sometimes said, exceptional circumstances or extraordinary circumstances. 
     
      
    14    The cases were recently reviewed in the judgment of this Court in Hamman (unreported 1 December 1998) and, for an even more recent reference, see Kelvin [2000] NSWCCA 190 (18 May 2000). The line of authority is consistent, and it is clear, and it was obviously well known to the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    15    I shall briefly refer to certain of the evidence that was before his Honour. There was evidence that the only one of the respondent's four children still living with her at the date of sentence was her daughter, Natalie, who was then 17 years of age. There was evidence that, effectively, the respondent had received no financial support for herself or her children during the course of her marriage. When she was asked by her counsel ""What did the money go on?"", she replied, ""Just the kids. Just general."" She said during the course of her evidence, ""I am sorry that I am here. I know (sic) have done wrong."" 
     
      
    16    There was a Pre-Sentence Report dated 7 April 2000 before his Honour, to which brief reference should be made. As to the paragraph “Circumstances Surrounding Offence”, the report reads; 
     
      
       
        
        ""The offender could not provide one clear reason why she claimed benefits whilst always in regular employment. She said she spent the money on general living costs and then private school fees for her youngest daughter. She resides in a modestly furnished home, and does not own a motor vehicle. She acknowledged she could have terminated her claim a few years ago under a then amnesty but decided not to do so."" 
        
       
       
       
      The report concludes; 
       
       
        
        ""It is considered the offender, other than for these offences, has her life in order, and supervision accordingly will be of limited value and is not recommended."" 
        
       
       
      
    17    In sentencing the respondent, his Honour said, ""This is not a case where the offences were committed because of greed."" 
     
      
    18    That was a generous finding indeed. Further, his Honour said, ""All the money that she received from Social Security was used to support her children."" With the greatest respect to his Honour, a finding of fact in those terms was not available to him. 
     
      
       
      His Honour concluded; 
       
       
        
        ""Ms Howe has shown some contrition, and she has pleaded guilty early in the proceedings. I have mentioned general deterrence, and I have mentioned the need to ensure that she is adequately punished. She is 50 years old. I suspect that she will not reoffend, and I have mentioned also the fact that she is the sole carer of a daughter who is at school. For those reasons, I will not impose a sentence of full-time custody."" 
        
       
      
    19    The conclusion is irresistible, however, in the light of the authorities, that the evidence fell demonstrably short of establishing very special circumstances, extraordinary circumstances, or exceptional circumstances, to justify his Honour imposing less than a full-time custodial sentence. 
     
      
    20    We have had the benefit of a careful and forceful argument by Ms Manuell on behalf of the respondent to the contrary. I am not persuaded, however, that the submissions which she has put in any way undermine the conclusion which I have expressed. 
     
      
    21    Firstly, reliance was placed upon the written submissions on behalf of the prosecution at the sentencing proceedings. I do not think that those submissions were formulated in such a fashion as to justify the Crown being denied the right to contend here that there was a manifest error in the learned sentencing judge's approach to this case. Indeed, irrespective of what was expressed in those submissions, his Honour was perfectly well aware of the well established line of authority, to which I have made reference. 
     
      
    22    Indeed, in her written submissions to his Honour, counsel for the prosecution submitted that it was a case that required a “custodial sentence”. I have no doubt that all concerned with the sentencing process would have considered such phrase to be a reference to a full-time custodial sentence. 
     
      
    23    Ms Manuell has also constructed an interesting argument based on the decision of this Court in Wegener, to which I have already made reference.  However, I would merely say, in my view, that there is nothing in that decision which would derogate from a finding that the sentence which his Honour imposed of imprisonment for twelve months to be served by way of periodic detention, was manifestly inadequate, in light of the evidence before his Honour, and the well established line of authority to which I have made reference. 
     
      
    24    This Court must accordingly re-sentence. The respondent has the very considerable assistance in the re-sentencing process - as was acknowledged fairly by Mr Staehli on behalf of the Crown - by the material which is contained in the affidavit of the respondent sworn this day, and received by this Court for consideration, in the event that it became necessary for the Court to re-sentence the respondent. 
     
      
    25    I shall not refer to the full detail of that material. However, it does establish that the respondent has complied dutifully with the terms of the sentence imposed by Judge Goldring, and has thus now served one third of that sentence. Restitution to date is now something in excess of $3,000. 
     
      
    26    One is mindful of the early plea of guilty by the respondent and the principle of double jeopardy is an element of the re-sentencing process. One must also take in account that there is no provision for remissions in this State: see s 16G of the Act. 
     
      
    27    This appeal comes at a very sensitive time so far as the respondent's daughter is concerned, because she has just completed her trial examinations for the Higher School Certificate. Having concluded the Higher School Certificate, Natalie, hopes to study hospitality at a TAFE College. The affidavit indicates that the uncertainty of the outcome of this appeal has affected her studies, and one would have little difficulty in accepting that proposition. 
     
      
    28    The affidavit also indicates that the other children of the respondent would have difficulty providing a suitable environment for Natalie to continue her studies, if this Court were to impose a sentence of full-time custody upon the respondent. 
     
      
    29    The situation presently before this Court is that the respondent has, to my mind, at this stage, and in the light of this additional material, and the present state of affairs, scraped over the threshold to satisfy the requirement of very special, exceptional or extraordinary circumstances. 
     
      
    30    However, be that as it may - and taking into account the constraints to which I have already referred - there must be, in my view, an increase in the sentence which was imposed by his Honour. 
     
      
    31    I would propose, therefore, that the sentences imposed by his Honour be set aside, and in lieu thereof this Court sentence the respondent to imprisonment for two years. I would propose that that sentence be served by way of periodic detention, to commence from 2 June 2000. 
     
      
    32    In view of the evidence before this Court, and before the sentencing judge - and I particularly make reference here to that which is contained within the Pre-Sentence Report to which I have already made reference - supervision of the respondent, when she completes her sentence, would not be necessary. Accordingly, I would propose that a recognizance release order is not appropriate; the reason being that supervision of the respondent at the conclusion of the service of her sentence would not be necessary. 
     
      
    33    The reparation order should be confirmed. 
     
      
    34    They are the orders which I would propose.35    WOOD CJ AT CL: I agree.36    DUNFORD J: I also agree.37    WOOD CJ AT CL: The orders will be accordingly as proposed by Carruthers AJ.

     REGINA v Nathan LEE 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1    NEWMAN J: This is an appeal against conviction and an application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    2    The applicant was indicted before Davidson DCJ on 28 July 1999 at Sydney on a charge of being armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a firearm and assaulting Patricia Edith Jones with intent to rob her. The maximum penalty for the crime pursuant to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 is imprisonment for twenty-five years. 
     
      
    3    The appellant pleaded not guilty but after a lengthy trial was found guilty by a jury of the offence. His Honour imposed a head sentence of eight years constructed by way of a minimum term of six years and an additional term of two years. 
     
      
       
      Evidence for the Prosecution 
       
      
    4    At about 8.15 pm on 21 March 1995 two men entered Mrs Patricia Jones’ video store at 108 Oxford Street, Paddington. 
     
      
    5    Mrs Jones gave evidence that she was sitting on a stool watching television when the two men entered her shop, one behind the other. She said it was a quiet night at the shop and there were no other customers present at the time. 
     
      
    6    Mrs Jones described the lighting in the shop. She said that there were about sixteen small globes at a window and three fluorescent tubes on the right hand side and the left hand side of the shop respectively. She said that there was an overhead light which was directed towards the new issued videos which were behind the counter. She said that there was a globe light in the counter and a single light in the foyer. 
     
      
    7    She described the man in front of her as of Asian appearance and the man behind him as Caucasian. The Asian man went to where the cash register was and stood behind it. She stood up. The Asian man produced a gun and pointed it at her. It was in his right hand. She saw it was a small gun and had some wood on the handle. She said he mumbled something to her like “money”. She immediately picked up the tape dispenser from the desk and threw it at him. As it did not seem to have any effect on him she reached down and picked up scissors but decided to drop them. Instead she picked up her stool and jabbed across the counter at the man. However, the stool did not come in contact with him as he had stepped backwards. She then took the stool and started walking towards the end of the counter. She heard him screaming at her and saw he was pointing his gun at her and making a motion with his hand, but nothing happened. He then made a downward motion and the gun discharged. She was not sure whether he was making one or two downward motions at that time. She smelt gun powder. It burnt her nostrils and there was a period when she was deafened and blinded by the discharge. 
     
      
    8    Mrs Jones said that at the time the Asian man was pointing the gun at her she was about three or four feet away from him. She saw him trying to lift the cash register off the counter with a jerking movement, but he fell over. She then swung the stool and hit him with it. She kept hitting him until he left the shop. She then closed the door behind him and rang the police. 
     
      
    9    She recalled that when she was throwing the tape dispenser at the Asian man she could no longer see the Caucasian man. She said that she could not see the Caucasian man “fully”. She said he was wearing a short white sleeve shirt with a brown pattern or panel across his shoulder. His hair was fair, light brown or ash blonde. It was about shoulder length and wavy. 
     
      
    10    Mrs Jones said the Asian man was wearing a black long sleeve jacket. He had black medium hair that went to about his earlobes. He had a round full face and hooded eyes. He was around five foot ten with a stocky build. 
     
      
    11    Mrs Jones rang Paddington police station and talked to a police officer who sounded like a female to her. She told her the man in her shop was an Asian. She said that she may have said that he had shortish hair down to his ear lobes and his hair was black. He was wearing a black long sleeved jacket. He had hooded eyes. 
     
      
    12    Mrs Jones said when she was hitting the Asian man with the stool his jacket came down. She saw he was wearing a sort of like light blue or bluey-green coloured T-shirt underneath his jacket. She said that she was blue/green colour blind as she could not tell whether it was blue or green when the colours were very light or very dark. 
     
      
    13    Mrs Jones said that she was shown a gun when she was at the police station. She said that it looked about the same size as the gun that was pointed at her in the shop. It had wood on its handle. She said that on 22 March 1995 Det Sharpe visited her and showed her a number of photographs. She wrote on the back of one of the photographs “I think this is him” in identifying the appellant. 
     
      
    14    On 23 March 1995 Mrs Jones was cleaning her shop with her brother-in-law, Brian Ellis. She found the perspex shelving of the new release section had a hole in it and the covers behind it had pieces missing. She said that Brian Ellis found a piece of metal in the garbag bin. It was a squashed looking piece of metal and she gave it to the police. She said that prior to this attempted robbery she had no knowledge of any other gun having been fired in her shop. 
     
      
    15    She was shown a photocopy of the photograph of a Mr Mounarath and asked how he compared with the man who pointed a gun at her in the shop. She said “the hair is different, the hair line, the face is - while round and full - a different shape, the lips are fuller, the nose is different.” 
     
      
    16    In re-examination she said she was wearing her glasses at the time of the attempted robbery and she had no difficulty in seeing the face of the man that was pointing the gun at her. 
     
      
    17    Mr Malcolm MacMillan gave evidence that at about “five, ten past eight” on 21 March 1995 he was waiting for his bus at the army barracks side of Oxford Street. He heard the voice of a woman shouting: “No, no. Get out” from the video shop directly opposite him. He said the lighting outside and inside the shop was very bright. He estimated the distance between him and the front of the shop would be between 25 to 30 metres. He saw a woman with a chair or a small coffee table trying to hit someone over the head. 
     
      
    18    There was another person who could have been a Caucasian standing behind the person whom the woman was trying to hit. He said that the Caucasian person had “reddy-brown” hair, and was about “five-seven to five nine”. He was medium to average build. His hair was “longish, unkempt sort of fluffy. He was wearing funny trousers as if he came out of Aladdin’s lamp”. He wore a yellowish and dark bony coloured sort of T-shirt. He saw him backing out and leaving the shop. 
     
      
    19    Mr MacMillan saw the Caucasian person turn left and go towards Glenmore Road. He was walking “normally” towards the traffic lights there. He said when he was about midway he came back to the shop and tapped at the window. He then headed back to Glenmore Road. 
     
      
    20    Mr MacMillan further gave evidence that the man who was hit by the woman in the shop came out about “10, 15” seconds after the first man left. He saw the door of the shop close almost immediately after he had left. He described that man as Asian. He was a little bit taller than the first man and would have been five-nine in height. At this time Mr MacMillan’s bus had arrived. He recalled it was fairly quiet at that time of the night and he did not notice anyone in particular. 
     
      
    21    He said both men would have been in their 20s. The Asian man had very black hair. It was a little longer than average. He was wearing a dark jacket with a white T-shirt or shirt. He was wearing normal trousers. He saw him leave the shop and turn right, then right again down to Hopewell Street. He was “walking smartly”. 
     
      
    22    Mr MacMillan said on 23 March 1995 he was shown nine photographs of Asian men by Det Pooley. He wrote on the back of one of the photographs “I’m 95 percent sure that is him” in identifying the appellant. 
     
      
    23    In cross-examination he said he had told the police that he thought a line-up would be a lot easier. He said that because a photograph did not indicate how tall the people that he was being asked to look at were. He said that when he had seen the Asian man coming from the shop he had seen him in a space of about five or so steps from the video shop out on Hopewell Street. He agreed that his sighting of the Asian man was for a fleeting moment. He said, however, he had a very good head-on view of him when he came out of the shop which he did not do quickly. He said he saw him head-on for eight to nine paces and that it was on that observation that he gave his description to the police and on which he was relying on when he looked at the photographs. He said that he only saw the writing (by Mrs Jones) on the back of the photograph when he was writing on the back of it, not before. He did not inadvertently turn over the photograph when he was looking at it. He denied that Det Pooley had said to him, or indicated to him, that this was the man that he had in his custody or anything like it. 
     
      
    24    In further cross-examination he was shown a photocopy of the photograph of Mr Mounarath and was asked whether that was the man who was seen leaving the video shop on 21 March 1995. He said “I didn’t think so, no”. In re-examination he said he had not seen the man in that photograph before the incident. 
     
      
    25    Snr Const Stone of the Fingerprint Section gave evidence that he had examined the cash register from the video shop but could not find any fingerprints there. 
     
      
    26    Mr A Dilorenzo gave evidence that in March 1995 he was a constable at Waverley police station. He said that at about 8.19 pm on 21 March 1995 he was patrolling Bondi Junction in company with Const Murchie, when a call came over the police radio to attend the video shop at the intersection of Oxford and Hopewell Streets, Paddington in relation to an armed hold-up. They went to the shop and obtained a description of the two offenders from the police who were already there. They left after 30 seconds. 
     
      
    27    At about 8.25 pm while they were patrolling in Kings Cross Road, he noticed an Asian male in company with another male person. They were seen heading in a westerly direction in Kings Cross Road, approximately 20 metres east of Darlinghurst Road. He said they then stopped their car and followed the two men on foot. Later the two men separated and Const Murchie stopped the other man while he continued to follow the Asian man. 
     
      
    28    When he was about five metres behind him he pulled out his police identification badge and called on him to stop. When he approached the Asian man he noticed that he had sweat running down his face and that his blue T-shirt was damp and was clinging to his body. He said to the Asian man, “why are you so sweaty?” and he replied, “it’s hot”. He noticed that he had a large bulge in the front of his jeans. He asked “what is that in your jeans?” and he replied, “nothing”. He searched and removed from him a dull silver coloured hand gun with a brown wooden handle. He found the hand gun had cartridges in the barrel. 
     
      
    29    He then radioed for other police assistance. At approximately 8.30 pm Consts West and Pascoe arrived. They took the Asian man to the rear of the caged truck. He was arrested and was given the caution. He said, “yeah, but two others did the hold-up, and they ran out and gave me the gun”. While he was at the rear of the caged truck he was further searched by Const Murchie in his presence. 
     
      
    30    Const Dilorenzo saw a dark coloured leather holster found down the front of the Asian man’s jeans. He said that at the time of the incident the Asian man was wearing blue jeans, a blue T-shirt and white joggers. He had a black leather jacket in his right hand. He also had a black leather bum bag around his waist. 
     
      
    31    Snr Const Murchie gave evidence that he took hold of a Caucasian man whom he ascertained later to be Romeo Calin. He said that he saw the Asian man stopped by Const Dilorenzo. He saw that man was sweating profusely and the pale blue T-shirt that he was wearing was wet and clinging to his body. 
     
      
    32    He said that while he was at Paddington police station the Asian man told him “it wasn’t me who did the hold-up. I just got given the gun. There were three of us. I waited outside whilst the other two went in the video shop. They came out and gave me the gun and said to hide it. They jumped into a yellow hatchback, a Suzuki maybe. It was parked around the corner. They took off before I could get in the car. I walked to the Cross after that”. 
     
      
    33    He told him one of the men was a Steven Jung, an Asian. He had short black hair and he was about 25 to 30 years old. He was wearing a black jacket and pants. He only knew the first name of the other man as Peter. He described Peter as an “Australian, about 25 to 30 years old, wearing a blue top and coloured pants. He had blonde short hair with a goatee. He was about 180cm tall and of medium build.” In cross-examination Snr Const Murchie said Romeo Calin was not one of the persons described by the Asian man. 
     
      
    34    Det Pooley gave evidence that he conducted a record of interview with the appellant on 21 March 1995. In relation to the offence, the appellant said “well, I was outside and - we were - we were driving around at first, right, in this yellow hatchback or a Suzuki, I’m not too sure and we came to this place on Oxford Street and this - all three of us got out and these two guys walked in and they came running out and one of them handed me that” (the gun). 
     
      
    35    Sgt North gave evidence that in 1995 he was attached to the Forensic Ballistics unit. On 24 March 1995 he received from Det Pooley one .22 calibre Italian manufactured 8 chambered revolver, one spent lead bullet, one .22 calibre Winchester fired cartridge case and two .22 calibre Winchester cartridges. He found the revolver to be in working order and capable of propelling a projectile by means of an explosive, which could inflict a lethal wound on a human being. However, the discharge of the weapon was spasmodic because of free play in the cylinder and wear of the die cast metal trigger mechanism. The cylinder was not indexing correctly, that is when the cylinder was rotated, the next cartridge to come around would not line up exactly with the axis of the barrel. In this case when it was discharged it shaved approximately a quarter of the bullet away because it was not lined up correctly with the barrel. He said the revolver was originally designed to discharge 6mm blank fire cartridges and it was formerly a blank fire firearm as defined under the Firearms Act. He said there was a fine firing pin impression on the head of each of the cartridges. It indicated at some time an attempt had been made, albeit unsuccessful, to discharge those cartridges. 
     
      
    36    Ms Sofia Beckett, solicitor, who had been acting for the appellant gave evidence that the appellant swore an affidavit in March 1996. It read: 
     
      
       
        
        “I, Nathan Lee, instruct my legal representative to inform the Court of the matter set out below. I confirm that my instructions that my involvement in this offence was only as an accessory after the fact. I am now in a position to state that the offender with the gun was a man named Vongsathit Mounarath who is currently at Long Bay Remand Centre.” 
        
       
      
    37    Mr Vongsathit Mounarath gave evidence that he had not met the appellant before August 1995. He did not go to the video store on Oxford Street and point a gun at a person inside the store. He had never used the name “Steven Jung”. He was shown exhibit 14 and he said it was him. He said he never associated with someone called Peter who was an Australian, about 25 to 30 years old, with blond short hair and a goatee, about 180 cm tall, and medium build possibly living at Bondi. He denied that he had told the appellant that he had committed attempted robbery in a video shop. 
     
      
    38    In cross-examination it was put to him that he had a conversation with the appellant about identifying him (Mounarath) being involved in the entry to the video store and that he had said “yes, go for it”, he replied “… I don’t remember saying that, I might have … but if I did, I think I would be stupid to put myself in that situation.” He said that he had been convicted of armed robbery in 1995. He said he knew a man by the name of Pailin Ung but did not know whether he was also known as Steve. 
     
      
    39    Pailin Ung gave evidence that he was also known as Stephen. He said he was in custody on 21 March 1995. This was confirmed by Mr N Guy from the Corrective Services department who gave evidence that Pailin Ung was in custody on 21 March 1995 for the whole of that day. He knew the appellant, having first met him in 1996. In cross-examination he said he did not on 21 March 1995 take part in the assault of a video store in Paddington and afterwards take the weapon, or a weapon with a likeness to that which was shown in the photograph, exhibit 10, and hand it to some other person outside the store. He was shown exhibit 14 and was asked whether he knew the person depicted. He said that it seemed like someone he met while he was in custody back at the time in Long Bay gaol, his name was Loa. He thought that his surname was Mounarath. He said the gun depicted in exhibit 10 did not belong to him and he had never seen it. 
     
      
    40    Det Snr Const Sharpe gave evidence that on 21 March 1995 after returning from the video store he saw the appellant at the police station. He said, “you fit the description of the guy who had the gun, we’ll have to arrange a line-up, is that all right?” The appellant said, “yeah, I didn’t do it”. He said that on 22 March 1995 he went with other police to the video shop and showed Mrs Jones nine photographs of Asian men. She looked through them and said “that one”. He asked “is it definitely him?” and she said “from what I can remember panic line I’d say yes”. 
     
      
    41    In cross-examination Det Sharpe said that after viewing the photographs, Mrs Jones wrote on the back of the photograph of the appellant, “I think this is him” and then signed it. In relation to the words “panic line” Mrs Jones said when she was identifying the photograph of the appellant, Det Sharpe said, “it might be ‘panic line’ or ‘panic blind’.” After his identification of the appellant Mr MacMillan, wrote on the back of the photograph, “I am 95 percent sure that is him”. In further cross-examination Det Sharpe denied that he had said to Mrs Jones “this photograph is the man we have in custody. Is this the man who came into the store?” 
     
      
    42    Det Marsden gave evidence that on 24 March 1995 he placed the Olympic brand pistol, the two live .22 cartridges, the one spent .22 cartridge and the holster into a super glue tank. He said “there were no fingerprints developed that would be identifiable and there were only partial marks and fragments developed on the items.” No fingerprints were obtained from the wooden handle of the pistol. He said someone with very sweaty hands would actually leave more smudge sweat marks rather than nice, clear fingerprints. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s reply 
       
      
    43    The appellant did not give or call any evidence at the trial but a photograph of himself was tendered during cross-examination of a crown witness. 
     
      
    44    The defence challenged the identification evidence given by Mrs Jones and Mr MacMillan on the basis that their identification was mistaken. 
     
      
    45    I turn then to the appeal against conviction. The sole ground of appeal was that the trial judge’s directions regarding identification evidence of Mrs Jones and Mr MacMillan were inadequate and a miscarriage of justice was thereby occasioned. 
     
      
    46    In the course of his summing up his Honour gave detailed directions as to how the jury should approach the evidence of Mrs Jones and Mr MacMillan in relation to their purported identification of the appellant. Those directions were not challenged by the appellant and have been accepted as being correct and in appropriate form. 
     
      
    47    Indeed, his Honour’s original directions on identification were in conformity with sections 116 and 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 and also complied with the concepts adumbrated in R v Heuston (1995) 81 A Crim R 387 and Domican v R (1992) 173 CLR 555. There is thus no need to reproduce those directions in these reasons. 
     
      
    48    However, before completing his directions his Honour, in accordance with the current practice, allowed the jury to go home at 4 pm. 
     
      
    49    The next day, following discussion with counsel in the absence of the jury, his Honour gave further directions. Those directions involved his correcting certain parts of his summing up and then giving some further directions concerning the identification evidence. No challenge has been made to the corrections then made by his Honour but it is the further directions he then gave regarding identification evidence which are the subject of this appeal. 
     
      
    50    His Honour directed the jury as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The next matter that I want to deal with is a summary of the relevant asserted weaknesses of the identification process revealed in the evidence in this case limited to what I regard as the principal matters which appears to be relied upon on behalf of the accused. First of all there was no identification parade and it is common ground in this case that that is the best method to be used in situations such as these. 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly as to the photograph, the accused obviously was not present when the witnesses Mrs Jones and Mr MacMillan were shown the photographs as he would have been on an identification parade, and hence he was not able to see the process for himself. As to the photographs again attention was drawn to the small sample of persons with what might be described as roundish fattish faces as opposed to lean faces. Still on the photographs the danger of the displacement effect is relied upon. That is to say that a witness having seen a photograph may unconsciously displace his or her mental image of the person he or she saw at the time of the offence with the mental image obtained when the photograph was seen. 
        
       
       
        
        Counsel for the accused submitted to you that this explains why Mrs Jones, in her description in written statements made after she had seen the photographs, mentioned for the first time hooded eyes and a black jacket and that the T-shirt which she had previously mentioned was dark in colour, she not having referred to any colour at all previously. She on the other hand, I remind you, says that she gave a full description mentioning hooded eyes and the black jacket to the female she spoke to immediately after the event at Paddington police station. There is however, no written record of such a conversation. 
        
       
       
        
        Counsel for the accused also relies upon the limited time which both Mrs Jones and Mr MacMillan had for observation. Mrs Jones was subject to a traumatic incident during which she was blinded by the discharge of the gun and also during which, for part of the time, the man was face down on the floor. Mr MacMillan’s observation was for, as he described it, a fleeting moment from across the road from the video shop, over the distance from coming out of the shop as he described it in his evidence to the corner of Hopewell Street where the man disappeared out of sight. And of course reliance is also placed on the qualified endorsements which appear on the back of the photograph in each case. Mrs Jones writing “I’m ninety-five percent sure that is the man”. 
        
       
       
        
        Finally, reliance is placed on the manner in which Mr MacMillan identified from the photographs, that is to say relying to a very large part on clothing which most closely matched the description given by him of the clothes worn by the Asian person he saw coming out of the shop. 
        
       
       
        
        Those are the further directions that I propose to give you and do give you members of the jury.” 
        
       
      
    51    The first submission made on behalf of the appellant was that the additional directions created an unfairness to the appellant in that they were said to be provided to the jury as a summary of the weaknesses relied upon by the defence. They were not provided at the same time as the important cautions regarding identification evidence and were not given with the imprimatur of the trial judge in the same context as the earlier directions. 
     
      
    52    It is not sufficient for the judge simply to repeat as such the arguments which counsel have put. See Domican. Furthermore in R v Davies and Cody (1937) 57 CLR 170 at 182 the High Court stressed that it was necessary for the judge to give “the weight of his judicial authority” to the warning as to the dangers involved in identification. See also Heuston (1995) 81 A Crim R 387 at 394. See also Clarke (1993) 71 A Crim R 58 at 72. 
     
      
    53    In Domican, the High Court at 561 said as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whatever the defence and however the case is conducted, where evidence as to identification represents any significant part of the proof of guilt of an offence, the judge must warn the jury as to the dangers of convicting on such evidence where its reliability is disputed. The terms of the warning need not follow any particular formula. But it must be cogent and effective. It must be appropriate to the circumstances of the case. Consequently, the jury must be instructed ‘as to the factors which may affect the consideration of [the identification] evidence in the circumstances of the particular case’. A warning in general terms is insufficient. The attention of the jury ‘should be drawn to any weaknesses in the identification evidence’. Reference to counsel’s arguments is insufficient. The jury must have the benefit of a direction which has the authority of the judge’s office behind it. It follows that the trial judge should isolate and identify for the benefit of the jury any matter of significance which may reasonably be regarded as undermining the reliability of the identification evidence.” 
        
       
      
    54    In Davies and Cody at 182-183 the High Court, in dealing with identification evidence, observed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “As the responsibility of convicting must rest with the jury their appreciation of the question is an important consideration, and in a case where the method of identification is open to the objections we have discussed, they should be clearly warned of the dangers, which according to the accepted view, do exist. 
        
       
       
        
        In the present case, we think that the observations of the learned judge do not amount to a fulfilment of this requirement. Following the view apparently prevailing in the Supreme Court of Victoria, he treated the matter as one depending upon a choice between rival systems, between different ‘schools of thought’, and did not give the weight of his judicial authority to a statement of the dangers which beset the method in fact adopted, and he did not fully explain those dangers. His direction cannot be described as a warning.” 
        
       
      
    55    In my view his Honour did not fall into error in making the additional directions which are the subject of challenge. Those directions were in addition to the entirely proper directions he had given the previous day in which the jury were clearly warned as to the dangers which existed in dealing with identification evidence. 
     
      
    56    The language used by his Honour in the additional directions did not constitute a mere reference to counsel’s arguments. What his Honour did was to point to the matters which had been raised as weaknesses in the identification evidence and put them squarely before the jury. 
     
      
    57    These further directions did not in any way cut down the force of his earlier directions on identification but in fact, underscored them by demonstrating to the jury the factual issues which had been raised by the defence in relation to the identification evidence. Accordingly, I am of the view that this first argument does not succeed. 
     
      
    58    Second, it was argued that when both Mrs Jones and Mr MacMillan purported to identify the appellant when shown photographs by the police, their identification of the appellant on that occasion did not amount to a positive identification. 
     
      
    59    In particular reliance was placed upon what both these witnesses had written on the back of the photographs of the appellant which they had selected as depicting him. Mrs Jones had written “I think this is him” and Mr MacMillan had written “I am 95 percent sure that is him”. 
     
      
    60    It was submitted that this mode of identification was similar to that which had been the subject of review by the High Court in R v Pitkin (1995) 130 ALR 35. In Pitkin a witness to the crime in question had, like Mrs Jones and Mr MacMillan, been shown photographs. When selecting the photograph of the accused in Pitkin the witness said, “this looks like the person” at 37. 
     
      
    61    The High Court observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “Obviously the fact that an accused person looks like a person who in fact committed a crime is of itself insufficient to ……… a conviction of that accused of the crime. Yet, prima facie, the evidence led against the appellant in the present case went no further than that.” (at 37) 
        
       
      
    62    And: 
     
      
       
        
        “Under our system of administrating criminal justice a person is not to be convicted of a serious crime on the sole basis of verbal ambiguity.” (at 39) 
        
       
      
    63    In the present case a challenge was in fact mounted by defence counsel to the admission of the very evidence of Mrs Jones and Mr MacMillan which is now the subject of challenge in this appeal. 
     
      
    64    A voir dire examination was held. His Honour in a considered judgment allowed the evidence to be given. No challenge has been raised in this appeal to his Honour’s ruling. However, even putting that important consideration to one side, in my view the identification from the photographs made by Mrs Jones and Mr MacMillan does not suffer from the defects exposed by the High Court in Pitkin. 
     
      
    65    Mrs Jones’ evidence as to her identification of the appellant, in chief, was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Were you given some photographs? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I was 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you do with the photographs when you were given them? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I looked at them. I separated some. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Sorry? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I separated some of the photographs out until I got to the one of my assailant which I recognised immediately and threw it onto, placed onto the brief case that was on the counter and said, ‘that’s him’. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Once you said, ‘that’s him’, what happened them? 
        
       
       
        
        A. They asked me to write in my own words on the back of the photograph. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you do that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. At the same time you wrote on the back of the photograph, was there anything on the back of the photographs? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you write on the back of the photograph? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I either - ‘I think this is the man’. I might have written, ‘I think you’ll find this is the man’. I think, no, I think I wrote, ‘I think this is the man’.” 
        
       
      
    66    Later, the following exchange occurred between herself and the Crown Prosecutor: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Do you recognise any of the photographs? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I recognise the photograph of my assailant.” 
        
       
      
    67    She did not resile from that evidence in any way. 
     
      
    68    Mr MacMillan’s evidence as to what occurred when he was shown the photographs by the police, in chief, was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you finally select a photograph? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I did, yes. I thought I was taking a little - but I didn’t know how long sort of I was expected to take. I thought I say taking too long and I said, ‘I’m sorry I’m taking so long’ and that sort of thing. He said, ‘don’t worry’ just you know, but initially I picked one almost immediately. I was just re-affirming with myself that’s all. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The one you selected, was that the one you referred to -- 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. -- that you picked in your mind almost immediately? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, yes.” 
        
       
      
    69    Again, Mr MacMillan did not resile from that evidence in cross-examination. 
     
      
    70    In any event, the statement that a person is 95 percent sure that the person depicted in the photograph was the person he saw at the scene of the crime is far distant from a statement that somebody in a photograph “looks like” a person they saw which was the subject of the High Court’s decision in Pitkin. 
     
      
    71    In my view the admission of the evidence of Mrs Jones and Mr MacMillan did not constitute any miscarriage of justice and the jury were entitled to take that evidence into account when dealing with the question of identification. I am of the view that this argument also fails. 
     
      
    72    It follows therefore that I am of the view that the appeal against conviction must also fail. 
     
      
    73    I turn then to the application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    74    No challenge was made to the head sentence of eight years. Indeed, when this matter was before this Court on an earlier occasion, R v Lee, unreported, NSWCCA, 24 March 1997, this Court observed that the sentence passed by the original trial judge, Saunders DCJ was plainly within the range. 
     
      
    75    What is argued is that his Honour should have found special circumstances and adjusted the proportion between the minimum and additional terms imposed so that the additional term would be longer and minimum term shorter. 
     
      
    76    His Honour did deal with the question of special circumstances. In fact he took into account, in imposing the head sentence, the fact that the appellant would have to serve any sentence in protective custody with its attendant hardships. 
     
      
    77    However, he specifically found that there were no special circumstances which required the proportion between the minimum and additional terms to be adjusted differently from the statutory ratio set by the Sentencing Act as it then stood. 
     
      
    78    Two arguments were advanced in support of the proposition that the minimum and additional terms should be varied in the manner suggested. 
     
      
    79    First, the fact that the appellant had to serve his sentence in protective custody. Second that his Honour did not give proper weight to the material contained in the report of the psychologist Anna Robilliard. 
     
      
    80    The first argument must fail because as this Court held in S, unreported, NSWCA, 24 February 2000, it is improper to allow the hardship of protective custody to operate as a reason for discounting the total sentence and as constituting special circumstances for reducing the minimum term as a proportion of that head sentence. 
     
      
    81    As to the second argument his Honour did deal, in depth, with the psychologist’s report. He concluded as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The psychologist in her conclusions describes your evolution from a negative, angry and depressed young man, to a more mature, positive and rational adult, which of course is consistent with the reported development of your significant insight into the circumstances and consequences of your drug habits. 
        
       
       
        
        Other material before me from the prison testifies that you have been putting your time in prison to good and constructive use. You have undertaken two courses at a tertiary level, and you have taken a significant part as editor and contributor to the Remand Centre magazine. 
        
       
       
        
        All of that indicates to me that your prospects for rehabilitation are good, and that you do not need - as submitted to me by Mr Brezniak on your behalf - an additional period of probation in the form of an increased additional term in order to promote your further rehabilitation.” 
        
       
      
    82    In my view his Honour made no error in determining the structure of the sentence. He did so having taken into account the appellant’s prospects of rehabilitation. Accordingly, while because of its importance to the appellant, I would grant leave to appeal on sentence, I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    83    The orders I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
       
      2. Leave granted to appeal against sentence but appeal dismissed. 
       
      
    84    O’KEEFE J: I agree with the orders proposed by Newman J and with his reasons. 
     
      
       
      
    85    WHEALY J: I agree with the reasons of Newman J and the order he proposes.

     SIMPSON J HIDDEN J Wednesday 4 October 2000 
     
     Regina v Kim Duke 
      
      
      
     Judgment 
    1     SIMPSON J: Justice Hidden will give the first judgment. 
     
      
       
      
    2     HIDDEN J: I think I can indicate at the outset that we have agreed that a term of periodic detention is the appropriate outcome. What I propose to do is give the reasons why I have arrived at that view and then, subject to anything the learned presiding judge might have to say, we might need your assistance as to the procedure under the new legislation and how the order ought to be framed. So I won't make any formal order or specify the length of the term I have in mind until we have had your assistance on the matter. 
     
      
       
      
    3     The applicant, Kim Duke, pleaded guilty in the District Court to the following charges: Using an offensive weapon with intent to prevent her lawful apprehension, an offence under s33B of the Crimes Act, common assault and larceny. On the charge under s33B she was sentenced to imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of nine months, to date from 9 June 2000, that being the date when sentence was passed. On each of the charges of common assault and larceny, she was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment for one month and those terms have now been served. She seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed in respect of the major charge, the charge under s33B of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
       
      
    4     The charges arise from the same incident. Shortly stated, the facts are these: In the late afternoon of 4 June 1999, the applicant went to a department store at Penrith Plaza. She selected a number of household items and attempted to leave the store without paying for them. She was approached by the store manager, a Ms Stefanac, who asked to inspect the bags which she was carrying. The applicant made no reply, but produced an unidentified article wrapped in black cloth which she thrust into the stomach area of Ms Stefanac. It is that conduct which gave rise to the charge of the common assault. 
     
      
       
      
    5     She then ran from the store, carrying with her the items she had selected. She was pursued by Ms Stefanac, who enlisted the aid of other security staff at Penrith Plaza, including Mr Troy Byrne. At one stage she abandoned the goods which she had taken from the store, but continued her escape. Eventually she was intercepted by security staff and surrounded by them. She then produced from her handbag what was described as a tazer device. This apparently was a home-made device, capable of inflicting an electric shock. She struck Ms Stefanac and Mr Byrne with that device. The shock caused Mr Byrne to be thrown backwards. He suffered two small puncture wounds to his left forearm and suffered nausea and dizziness. He received medical attention. It seems that Ms Stefanac herself did not sustain any significant injury. 
     
      
       
      
    6     The applicant was restrained and taken into custody. The goods which she had stolen, all of which were recovered, were of a value of something less than $200. 
     
      
       
      
    7     His Honour was satisfied that the tazer device was not capable of causing death or inflicting any permanent injury. He accepted the applicant’s evidence that she did not carry it on that occasion for the purpose of avoiding apprehension. Her evidence was that she had the device as a form of protection against her then de facto partner, who was habitually violent to her. That's a matter to which I shall return. 
     
      
       
      
    8     Nevertheless, his Honour characterised the use of the weapon in those circumstances as serious and such as to call for a deterrent sentence. Certainly, offences of this kind are properly viewed seriously. This Court, on more than one occasion, has said as much in cases dealing not only with attempted apprehension by police officers, but also by citizens acting in other capacities: see R v Hamilton (1993) 66 ACrim R 575; R v Carter (CCA, unreported, 29 October 1997); and R v Bazzi [1999] NSWCCA 346. 
     
      
       
      
    9     His Honour accepted that the applicant had pleaded guilty at the earliest reasonable opportunity. She is now thirty-four years old. She has some criminal record, but its age and nature are such that his Honour saw it as of little or no significance. She had never before been sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  
     
      
       
      
    10     She has a sad background, which was detailed in a comprehensive report of Dr Christopher Lennings, a clinical psychologist, which report was before his Honour. It is unnecessary to go to the detail of that material. As his Honour observed, she had had an unhappy life, including a troubled childhood. She had been physically abused by her stepfather, and she had been in two de facto relationships, both characterised by abuse. This was especially true of the second of those relationships, which was on foot at the time these offences were committed. 
     
      
       
      
    11     Perhaps not surprisingly, she had a history of abuse of alcohol and, more significantly, of drugs: amphetamines and Panadeine Forte in particular. Indeed, on the very day of the offences she had been subject to a serious episode of violence inflicted upon her by her de facto partner. She had drunk bourbon and consumed amphetamines and Panadeine Forte. To Dr Lennings she described her emotional state at the time as “desperate”. 
     
      
       
      
    12     She has children from the two relationships to which I have referred, a daughter who is now about seventeen years old and twins who are only three years old. 
     
      
       
      
    13     Dr Lennings had this to say in his helpful report:  
     
      
       
        
         
         Miss Duke is not coping with the adversities of life. Her offence appears to derive from a problematic and violent relationship which she has since terminated. Her behaviour contributing to the offence was a mixture of her drug affected personality at the time, the impact of a recent beating from her de facto, and a mild sense of persecution she experienced (probably as a result of the drug induced mood change, the beating and her life experiences). At the time of the offence she was being treated for depression and without a doubt her significant depression was contributory to her behaviour. 
         
        
        
       The doctor continued: 
        
        
         
         From a psychological perspective Ms Duke is beginning to reform her relationship with her children after a long separation and a custodial sentence would be expected to seriously impact on her ability to mother and care for her children in the future. Secondly, Ms Duke's emotional state is very poor and in my view she requires some treatment for it. My thoughts on this matter is that a comprehensive treatment plan needs to be established for Ms Duke. 
         
        
        
       The doctor concluded his report by outlining what he considered would be an appropriate treatment plan if she were to remain at liberty in the community. 
        
       
      
    14     His Honour accepted that the applicant had severed her relationship with her abusive partner. At the time of sentence she was living with her mother and caring for her children. His Honour also accepted that she had ceased her use of drugs and, as he put it, “seemed to be making a real attempt to avoid coming in conflict with the criminal law”. Nevertheless, his Honour determined that the seriousness of the offence and the need for deterrence compelled a full-time custodial sentence. Periodic detention had been urged upon him but he rejected it, saying: 
     
      
       
        
         
         I would be failing in my duty and being weakly merciful were I to adopt anything other than a full-time custodial sentence. In my view any other sentence would be inappropriate. 
         
        
       
      
    15     Nevertheless, his Honour expressed great concern about the welfare of the twin children, recognising the importance of their need for a mother’s care. It was this, together with the obvious prospects of the applicant’s rehabilitation, which led him to find special circumstances in accordance with the new legislation and to specify a non-parole period significantly lower than that which the normal proportion would have dictated. 
     
      
       
      
    16     In this Court argument for the applicant resolved itself into an assertion that this was a case not calling for a full-time custodial term. In short, it was argued that his Honour fell into error in rejecting out of hand the option of periodic detention. The Crown prosecutor in this Court acknowledged that a term of imprisonment by way of periodic detention would have been open to his Honour, but submitted nonetheless that his Honour did not fall into error in imposing the relatively modest custodial sentence which he did. 
     
      
       
      
    17     Having had the opportunity to reflect upon the matter, I am satisfied that his Honour did fall into error in imposing a full-time custodial sentence in this unusual case. Not only was the option of periodic detention available to him, I am satisfied it was the appropriate course to take. I say so because of the applicant’s background, the circumstances giving rise to the offence, the nature of the offensive weapon involved and the reason for which she was carrying it, her mental state at the time, her family responsibilities and her prospects of rehabilitation. The combination of those circumstances satisfy me that this is an exceptional case where a full-time custodial sentence was not called for. 
     
      
       
      
    18     We have been assisted by some Judicial Commission statistics provided by the Crown prosecutor, from which it does appear that the sentence of two years is low in the range of full-time custodial sentences for this type of offence, but what they also disclose is that in thirty-four per cent of the fairly large sample contained in those figures dispositions other than full-time custody were resorted to. 
     
      
       
      
    19     In the circumstances, I am of the view that the Court should intervene and should do so by imposing a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention. In arriving at the appropriate sentence, I would have regard to some further affidavit material with which we have been provided, which demonstrates the real difficulties occasioned by the applicant's separation from her little children and also suggests that she has participated to the extent that she has thus far been able in education programs within the prison system. I am also of the view that in framing the appropriate order, we should have regard to the fact that she has now served some four months of full-time custody. 
     
      
       
      
    20     It is at this stage, if that is the view of the court, that I would invite counsel's assistance as to the appropriate procedure and the relevant provisions of the new legislation. 
     
      
       
      
    21     SIMPSON J: It may be a convenient course if I express my views as to the reasons for coming to that result and then we will determine the order. I agree in large measure with what has been said by Justice Hidden. There is one minor point of departure which I will come to in a moment. The issue revolves around the passage in the remarks on sentence which has been quoted by Justice Hidden. The Crown acknowledged during the course of argument that this was a case in which a sentence of periodic detention was one of the available possibilities, although he urged that the sentence imposed was also an available sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    22     In my opinion, the error that has been disclosed was in the sentencing judge discarding from consideration the option of periodic detention. He therefore cut off one possibility legitimately available to him. I am not convinced that the sentence imposed was not within the available range, had his Honour properly directed himself as to that range. 
     
      
       
      
    23     What I have said should not be taken to mean that a sentencing judge has in every case to define the parameters of the range and then select a sentence within that range, but here it is clear that the sentencing judge excluded from consideration one available option and the result of that is that error has been disclosed and this Court should proceed to re-sentence and in doing so, take account of the material that has been placed before us. 
     
      
       
      
    24     HIDDEN J: Thank you both for your assistance. The view I have reached is that, even though the applicant has now served some months of full-time custody, justice would be done if the sentence his Honour actually imposed were to be specified, but directed to be served by way of periodic detention. The simplest way to do that is this: The order I would propose is that leave to appeal be granted, the appeal be allowed and the sentence imposed by his Honour on the charge under s33B of the Crimes Act be quashed. The sentence I would propose is: The head sentence would be for one year and eight months, with a non-parole period of five months, to date from Friday next, 13 October 2000 and to be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
       
        
       I would direct the applicant's release at the expiration of the non-parole period, the parole order being subject to the condition that she accept the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service for as much of the parole period as that Service considers appropriate. She is to report to the Norma Parker Periodic Detention Centre on Friday next, 13 October. 
        
       
      
    25     I note that Mr Scouler, her counsel, has undertaken to afford her the explanation of her obligations required by s71 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, and I would direct that the Registry forward to her by fax this afternoon the notification of the result of this application and the notice required by s72 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. That material should be faxed to whatever institution currently holds her. Both parties have liberty to apply, in case any procedural or technical problems arise with compliance with either of those ss71 or 72. 
     
      
       
      
    26     SIMPSON J: I agree with the orders proposed and the orders will therefore be as proposed by Justice Hidden and I note in the event of any difficulties, the parties should notify the court so that the matter can be re-listed on Friday for the formalities to be attended to.

     REGINA v Nils John Edward KENNY 
     
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1   FOSTER AJA: I agree with Smart AJ. 
    2   DUNFORD J: I agree with Smart AJ. 
    3   SMART AJ: Upon the conclusion of argument on 5 May 2000 this Court dismissed Mr Kenny’s appeal with reasons to be given later.  
    4   Nils John Edward Kenny appeals, with the certificate of the primary judge, against his decision refusing to grant a permanent stay of proceedings in respect of the prosecution of four serious sexual offences allegedly committed by Mr Kenny against C when a child aged nine and ten and a further four serious sexual offences allegedly committed by Mr Kenny against W, when a child. W is the brother of C and about two years older. It is alleged that the offences took place in 1985 and 1986 while the boys were being looked after by a baby-sitter, Mrs Nelson, the appellant’s grandmother. Some of the offences are alleged to have occurred in the home of the parents of C and W and some in the grandmother’s home. The appellant lived with his grandmother and mother. Their home was close to that of W and C. 
    5   It was the unavailability of Mrs Nelson to give evidence on behalf of the appellant that gave rise to the application for a stay. She is now an elderly lady who by reason of her physical and mental condition could not give evidence. 
    6   Neither W nor C made any complaint in 1985 or 1986. In May 1995 the boys’ father went to the police. In June 1995 statements were obtained from each boy by Sergeant Devine. In July 1995 he attended on Mrs Nelson but she declined to be interviewed or make a statement. Mrs Nelson was by this time an elderly lady and her daughter, Mrs Kenny, was overseas. The latter, on returning to Sydney in August 1995, became aware that the police were investigating allegations concerning her son, the appellant. She spoke with her mother (Mrs Nelson) and obtained a sketchy account of the police visit and the allegations which had been made, an assertion by her mother that the allegations were lies and a brief summary from her of the appellant’s activities and conduct whilst baby-sitting. On 20 September 1995 the appellant attended upon Detective Sergeant Devine and denied the allegations made about him. 
    7   Later in 1995 the appellant was charged with the subject offences. His first trial was in August 1996 but that was aborted when the jury was discharged for reasons not disclosed in the papers. At his second trial in February 1997 the appellant was convicted. On 29 August 1997 this Court quashed the convictions and ordered a new trial. The summing up gave the jury no instruction as to delay and its possible bearing upon the credibility and reliability of the evidence given by the two boys. Nor did the summing up contain any directions as to the significance of prejudice to the appellant in meeting the complaints by reason of the delay. 
    8   On 14 July 1998 Judge Downs refused an application for a permanent stay and alternatively for separate trials. On 10 December 1998 this Court held that Judge Downs had proceeded incorrectly and misdirected himself. The application was remitted to the District Court for further consideration. 
    9   On 22 September 1999 Wall ADCJ refused the stay. In a separate judgment he ordered that there be separate trials. There has been no appeal by the Crown against that order. 
    10   The judgment of Studdert J of 29 August 1997 in this Court contains a helpful summary of the course of the trial in February 1997 and the evidence given. The prosecution depended substantially on the evidence of W and C. There was some material capable of affording support for their evidence but it was not of a weighty kind. For example, both parents of W and C recalled occasions when they saw the appellant at their home in 1986 after they had returned from being out. 
    11   During his judgment Studdert J summarised the evidence of the appellant thus: 
     
      
       
       “The appellant gave sworn evidence denying the commission of the offences. He said that there were only two occasions when he went to the complainants’ house whilst his grandmother was babysitting and those occasions were in 1984. Once he went there to take a television guide to his grandmother and the other occasion was to take a cardigan to her. On the first occasion he did not see either complainant; on the second occasion he saw one of them only, but on that occasion he was only in the house for two minutes. According to the appellant his grandmother did not babysit the complainants after she returned from an overseas trip in August 1985. The appellant’s evidence was that he was actively involved in the Young Liberal movement and on most Saturday nights in 1986 he was attending functions for that organisation. A number of witnesses were called who gave evidence about the appellant’s involvement with the Young Liberals and the functions he attended in 1986. There was evidence of the appellant’s good character.” 
       
      
    12   The Judge said: 
     
      
       
       “Moreover, it is evidence that the appellant was able to gather together a considerable body of evidence to address the Crown case. The appellant had available to him his diaries from 1984 onwards. He was also in possession of his passport and airline tickets to establish the absence of his grandmother and himself overseas on a visit to the United States in 1985 and he had some other evidence directed to proving that his grandmother did not babysit the complainants after that trip. The appellant had documentary evidence to establish another trip he took overseas in December 1985-January 1986. He identified at the trial his air ticket and boarding pass for a flight to Brisbane and Cairns in June 1986. The appellant was able to call witnesses who proved his involvement in the activities of the Young Liberal Party on Saturday evenings in 1986 and he was able to call evidence directed at establishing he was elsewhere on 15 February 1986, which was a date upon which on the Crown case one of the offences was committed.” 
       
      
    13   There was also evidence from a Mrs Austin who said that Mrs Nelson babysat full time for her between September 1985 and 1992 during which time the surname of the boys (the complainants) was not mentioned. However, Mrs Nelson attended to the Austin children full time during the week but on Saturday nights only if Mrs Austin went out. Further, the appellant relied on his good character. 
    14   Studdert J commented: 
     
      
       
       “The evidence placed before the jury in the defence case directed to proving the appellant’s movements on Saturday nights by no means excluded opportunity for the appellant to have attended the home of the complainants’ parents during 1986. The jury had the appellant’s diary which did not contain entries for every Saturday and this diary, the appellant conceded in cross-examination, recorded entries of appointments which the appellant did not necessarily keep. Evidence of other members of the Young Liberal movement that the appellant regularly attended functions in 1986 was not so comprehensive as to establish, if it was accepted, that the appellant had no opportunity in 1986 to attend the home of the complainants on a number of Saturday nights.” 
       
      
    15   When this Court enquired of senior counsel for the appellant whether it was proposed to rely on the evidence called on his behalf at the second trial and summarised by Studdert J it was told that the appellant did not propose to do so as it had been rejected by the jury. A more general and less detailed case would be conducted on behalf of the appellant. The appellant was also concerned that his evidence had been rejected by the jury. Nevertheless, the appellant may still give evidence. That was undecided. The appellant now wished to attach importance to the evidence which Mrs Nelson could have given. Such a change of direction and emphasis enabled this present application for a stay to be made. It is apparent that Wall ADCJ did not have the judgments of this Court of 29 August 1997 and was not informed of the appellant’s change of direction and of emphasis. Neither before the first trial or the second trial was any application made for a permanent stay. Nor was any attempt made to adduce in evidence what the grandmother had said. 
    16   Wall ADCJ accepted that Mrs Nelson by reason of her situation would be an important witness in relation to giving an account of what occurred in relation to the care of the boys and the opportunity or lack of it which the appellant had to commit the offences charged. The judge recorded that the Crown case was that Mrs Nelson was not aware of what was taking place in a room between the appellant and either or both of the boys. The two boys contend that she was never present in the room when the sexual offences occurred. 
    17   The evidence given by Mrs Kenny on the voir dire before Judge Downs was before Wall ADCJ. It included: 
     
      
       
       “Q. Did she [Mrs Nelson] say to you anything about where it was that these alleged matters had occurred? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Yes, she did. She said it was supposed to have happened at the [surname of W and C] house when she was baby-sitting.” 
       
      
    18   Apparently, Mrs Nelson did not mention to her daughter that the allegations also included occasions on which she minded W and C in her own home. Mrs Kenny asserted that Mrs Nelson stated that the offences were supposed to have happened in 1984 and that the appellant only called in about twice. According to Mrs Kenny, Mrs Nelson said: 
     
      
       
       “I can remember him calling in to give me a TV guide and there was another time when I telephoned and asked to bring my cardigan up on his way out.” 
       
      
    19   Mrs Kenny asserted that her mother said that the allegations were all lies. The evidence given by Mrs Kenny as to her mother’s statements indicate that they were general in their terms. Not much detail was given or obtained. 
    20   The Crown has stated that it will not object to Mrs Kenny giving evidence of what Mrs Nelson said to her. The value of such evidence will be reduced by the warning as to its reliability which will probably be given. Even without such a warning the evidence of Mrs Kenny will not have the value that direct evidence from Mrs Nelson would have. It should not be overlooked that had Mrs Nelson been able to give evidence she would have been cross-examined as to the number of times the appellant was present while W and C were being minded, what he did and the accuracy of her recollection. The two visits allegedly mentioned by Mrs Nelson were probably to the parents’ home. There were occasions when she looked after W and C in her home. The eighth count related to an incident in the appellant’s bedroom. The material displayed in that room included pictures of naked and scantily dressed women. That was likely to make the occasion memorable for the boys. There was also the question of where in the homes of the parents and herself the children were and where she was. She would not have been anticipating conduct by the appellant of the kind alleged. 
    21   With the evidence of W and C and the supporting evidence of their parents the appellant faces a Crown case of some strength. 
     
      
     The Judge’s Reasons 
      
    22   The judge considered many of the relevant cases. He concluded that the absence of Mrs Nelson in the trial was not a feature which had the character of being a fundamental defect going to the root of the trial such as to demand a stay of proceedings. 
    23   The judge envisaged that the trial judge would give the usual direction that by reason of absence of complaint until some 10 years after the alleged offences, the appellant had been placed at a significant disadvantage in the conduct of his defence and that the jury should give close attention to that fact. Some of the directions needed have been spelt out in the judgment of Studdert J of 29 August 1997. In the light of the present situation the directions will need to go further. The jury should also be told that because of the delay in complaint the appellant has been prejudiced in the conduct of his defence by not being able to call Mrs Nelson to give evidence on his behalf to the effect that the allegations were lies. The direction will have to be fashioned in the light of the evidence given at the new trial. 
    24   In conclusion the judge said: 
     
      
       
       “What I have said should not be taken to indicate that I believe those directions which the trial judge can give in this case would provide any remedy for the prejudice. At best it would only provide a slight correction of the prejudice suffered by the accused by not having Mrs Nelson available to give evidence. 
       
      
      
       
       The view I have come to is that on the basis that Mrs Nelson cannot give evidence with all the disadvantages and prejudice to the defence that flows from her inability to give evidence, nonetheless that is not a circumstance, in my view, that should go to the exercise of the discretion to grant a stay.” 
       
      
    25   The appellant submitted that on these findings the judge was bound to grant a permanent stay as he was, in effect, holding that if the trial proceeded the appellant would suffer incurable prejudice and that he could not have a fair trial. Further, the appellant contended that the judge erred in holding that the inability of Mrs Nelson to give evidence did not go to the exercise of the discretion to grant a stay. 
    26   Read as a whole the judge in his reasons appears to be of the view that the appellant will suffer prejudice from not being able to call Mrs Nelson and that that will only be slightly alleviated by the directions which can be given and the concessions made by the Crown in agreeing to allow hearsay evidence to be given but that her absence was not sufficient in the circumstances to grant a stay. 
    27   Counsel for the appellant concentrated upon various passages in the judgments of the High Court in Jago v. The District Court of New South Wales and Others (1989) 168 CLR 23. At 33 Mason CJ said: 
     
      
       
       “The test of fairness which must be applied involves a balancing process for the interests of the accused cannot be considered in isolation without regard to the community’s right to expect that persons charged with criminal offences are brought to trial … At the same time, it should not be overlooked that the community expects trials to be fair…” 
       
      
    28   The appellant placed reliance upon this passage at 34 where Mason CJ continued: 
     
      
       
       “To justify a permanent stay of criminal proceedings there must be a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial ‘of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences:’ Barton per Wilson J (1980) 147 CLR at 111.” 
       
      
    29   The appellant contended that the absence or unavailability of an important witness could constitute a fundamental defect and did so in the present case where there was no other witness who could fully support the appellant. Her evidence went to the non-commission of the offences. Counsel described Mrs Nelson as a crucial and fundamental witness. I would be prepared to accept that she could have been an important witness but I would not further elevate her position. The view now propounded on behalf of the appellant as to Mrs Nelson was not taken at the first trial. The ultimate importance of Mrs Nelson may well have depended upon how she fared in cross examination including the extent and reliability of her recollection and observations. Close family members are not always the most compelling witnesses especially when the allegations of the complainants involve the consequence that she was not looking after them adequately. 
    30   The appellant also relied on the remarks of Deane J at 57 as to the necessity for a fair trial and his examples of what might cause a trial to become unfair. He did not refer to the present type of case. Reliance was placed on the observations of Toohey J at 71-72. 
    31   Counsel submitted that Toohey J envisaged that while it would often be possible to cure any prejudice to an accused by evidentiary rulings and by directions to the jury this would not always be so and that there could be cases where, having regard to the defect or defects, directions could not ensure a fair trial. Counsel further submitted that this was such a case. 
    32   The appellant also relied on this passage from the judgment of Gaudron J at 77-78: 
     
      
       
       “The exercise of the power to reject evidence, either alone or in combination with a trial judge’s other powers to control criminal proceedings, will often suffice to remedy any feature of the proceedings which might otherwise render them unjust or unfair. The existence and availability of these powers, when considered in the light of the necessarily limited scope of the power to grant a permanent stay, serve to indicate that a court should have regard to the existence of all its various powers, and should only grant a permanent stay if satisfied that no other means is available to remedy that feature which, if unremedied, would render the proceedings so seriously defective, whether by reason of unfairness, injustice or otherwise, as to demand the grant of a permanent stay. 
       
      
    33   The appellant contended that there was no means other than by granting a permanent stay to remedy the actual prejudice suffered by him in not being able to call Mrs Nelson as a witness. Reliance was placed on the views expressed by the trial judge. 
    34   The appellant has lost the opportunity to call Mrs Nelson. There has been no detailed statement from her. It is not known how compelling her evidence would have been and how well she would have fared in cross examination. The unavailability of Mrs Nelson will not render the proceedings seriously defective. The jury can be told of her state of health and they will have the advantage of the conversation she had with her daughter providing general support for the appellant. The jury can also be directed that the absence of her evidence has made the conduct of the appellant’s case more difficult and put him at a distinct advantage in defending himself with the delay in complaint by the complainants contributing to the situations. The directions could and should be put in cogent terms. As with the first trial much will depend on the view which the jury takes of the appellant’s evidence, if he gives evidence. 
    35   In Jago at 47 Brennan J said: 
     
      
       
       “Obstacles in the way of a fair trial are often encountered in administering criminal justice. Adverse publicity in the reporting of notorious crimes ( 
       Murphy v The Queen 
       ), adverse revelations in a public enquiry ( 
       Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employee’s and Builders Labourers’ Federation) 
       , absence of competent representation ( 
       McInnis v The Queen 
       ;  
       MacPherson v The Queen) 
       , or the death or unavailability of a witness, may present obstacles to a fair trial; but they do not cause the proceedings to be permanently stayed. Unfairness occasioned by circumstances outside the court’s control does not make the trial a source of unfairness. When an obstacle to a fair trial is encountered, the responsibility cast on a trial judge to avoid unfairness to either party but particularly to the accused is burdensome, but the responsibility is not discharged by refusing to exercise the jurisdiction to hear and determine the issues. The responsibility is discharged by controlling the procedures of the trial by adjournments or other interlocutory orders, by rulings on evidence and, especially, by directions to the jury designed to counteract any prejudice which the accused might otherwise suffer.” 
       
      
    36   That passage seems apt to the circumstances of the present case. 
    37   In R v McCarthy, CCA, unreported, 12 August 1994 at p. 12 Gleeson CJ (with whom Carruthers and Hunter JJ agreed) said: 
     
      
       
       “Time and time again it happens in criminal proceedings that for any one of a variety of reasons witnesses who may be regarded as important by one side or the other die, or become ill, or lose their memory, or lose documents. If the result of that were that nobody could obtain a fair trial, and the proceedings had to be permanently stayed, it would go a long way towards solving the problems of delay in the criminal lists in this State. However, the position is that it is well recognised that an occurrence of that kind does not of itself mean that a person cannot obtain a fair trial or that proceedings need to be stayed.” 
       
      
    38   In R v. Goldburg, CCA, unreported, 23 February 1993 at 5 Mahoney JA (with whom Gleeson CJ and Abadee J concurred) thought that there may be circumstances where the absence of a witness may, because of the peculiar nature of the circumstances, provide the basis for a stay. I agree but that is not this case. Mahoney JA’s provisional view was “The mere fact that a witness who would otherwise have been available has died or otherwise become unavailable does not as such warrant the granting of a stay of proceedings.” That is the general rule but is subject to the exception which he mentioned. In Goldburg it was held that the unavailability of an important alibi witness due to her medical condition did not warrant the grant of a stay. 
    39   This is not a case where because of the peculiar nature of the circumstances the absence of Mrs Nelson provides the basis for a stay. A good example of such a case is Davis (1995) 81 ALR 156. The alleged offences occurred many years previously. As a medical practitioner Davis had seen thousands of patients and his clinical records had been destroyed in circumstances where no blame had been levelled at anyone. Without such records he would not be able to say what he did and why and to give instructions to his counsel. 
    40   The appellant has the advantage of his own evidence, the benefit of Mrs Kenny’s summary of what Mrs Nelson said and directions to the effect earlier mentioned and perhaps others designed to counteract any prejudice which he may suffer in not being able to call Mrs Nelson. These are not insignificant. On balance, a permanent stay should not be granted. The judge reached the right conclusion. It is not necessary to embrace the whole of his reasons and I have not done so. 
    41   As is so often the case on applications for a permanent stay this Court has materials which were not before the primary judge. This court had the benefit of knowledge of the course of the earlier trial and the Court’s judgment of 29 August 1997 and thus a fuller picture than that before the judge. 
    42   In Goldburg at p. 5 it was noted that this Court was given a discretion under s 5F(5) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to deal with the interlocutory judgment or order made in the District Court. Under that sub-section this court may affirm or vacate the order appealed against or it may make an interlocutory judgment or order instead of the judgment or order appealed against. 
    43   Both on the materials before the judge and the materials before this Court, a stay should not be granted. Thus the appeal was dismissed.

      GREG JAMES, J. 
      
      KIRBY, J. 
     TUESDAY 12 SEPTEMBER 2000 
     
     REGINA v. DONALD VICTOR GREENAWAY 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   PRIESTLEY, JA: I will ask Greg James, J. to give the first judgment. 
    2   GREG JAMES, J: Initially, these were proceedings for leave to appeal in respect of sentences imposed on some six counts of criminal offences, by his Honour Judge Coleman in the District Court sitting at Newcastle. 
    3   The applicant had pleaded guilty on the six counts. He was represented on those pleas. His Honour convicted the applicant on each of the six counts. The submissions by the legal practitioner appearing on his behalf did not descend to great detail and afforded most limited assistance to his Honour. 
    4   When the matter came before us, in consequence of matters drawn to our attention by the Crown in their written submissions, those matters having come to the cognisance of those now acting for the applicant, an application for an extension of time to appeal against conviction and a notice of appeal against conviction was by the leave of the court, filed. 
    5   The offences of which the applicant was convicted and to which he pleaded guilty were in the case of four of the offences, offences under s.81 of the Crimes Act 1900, of indecent assault upon a male. Those offences were each punishable by a maximum penalty of five years penal servitude. The other two offences comprised the offence of buggery under s.79 of the Crimes Act 1900, punishable by 14 years penal servitude, and an offence of committing an act of gross indecency by a male upon a male, an offence under s.78Q(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment. 
    6   It is not necessary to turn to the details of the dates specified in the counts to which the applicant had initially pleaded in the Local Court and which had come to the District Court by reason of the provisions of s.51A of the Justices Act 1902, except in respect of count four. It is in respect of that count that the applicant has sought the extension of time to appeal and has sought to appeal against conviction. That count was expressed as charging an indecent assault which had occurred between 1 November 1983 and 31 December 1984. 
    7   The Crimes Act 1900 was amended by the Crimes Amendment Act 1984 which amendments took effect as and from 8 June 1984 repealing s.81, thus abolishing the crime created by that provision. Section 78Q of the Crimes Act 1900 was inserted by the amending Act and the offence thereby created existed from that date. 
    8   The history of these provisions and the question of the essentiality of the dates in such circumstances has been extensively reviewed in this court in Queen v. Stringer [2000] NSWCCA 213, particularly in the judgment of Adams J. 
    9   It has become apparent, when one has regard to the Crown's submissions that it is not possible to fix the occasion upon which the indecent assault alleged is said to have occurred with any greater accuracy that at sometime during the period particularised. It follows that it is not possible to say whether an offence was committed under the repealed provision or under the new provision. 
    10   It is common ground that the old offence was abolished and that the new provision creates a new offence. In those circumstances, it has been submitted that the extension should be granted and the appeal allowed. In that regard our attention has been drawn by the Crown to the decision of this court in Page v. The Queen (CCA, unreported, 25 November 1991 at 8-9), and the decision to similar effect of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia, in Regina V. Kailis [1999] WASCA 29 in particular at paragraphs 8-67 in the judgment of the Chief Justice, with whom Ipp and Anderson, JJ. agreed. 
    11   The specification of dates fixing the time of the commission of an offence in an indictment is usually a mere matter of particulars, however, in appropriate circumstances, that mere matter of particulars may achieve importance such as to show that the offence might not be maintainable in law or to reveal a latent duplicity. 
    12   It matters not in the present case which mode of analysis one adopts; suffice it to say that the Crown concedes that the conviction for either of the two offences, reference to which in the charge sheet was made, engagingly, by setting out the section number of the original section, s.81 separated by an oblique from the reference to the new section, s.78Q, cannot be maintained. 
    13   In those circumstances, the appeal under s.6(1) should be allowed. The time for appealing should be extended. The consequence is that the conviction on the fourth count should be set side and the sentence on that count quashed, the application for leave to appeal against the sentences and that appeal be granted and this court should proceed to re-sentence. 
    14   The sentences imposed by his Honour on the various counts were imposed in consequence of his Honour having regard to the totality of the sentences, both to the totality of circumstances and to the overall effect of the sentences, although it was necessary for his Honour to adjust the precise expression of the sentences he imposed anew after apparently concluding the sentencing exercise.  
    15   Although his Honour's final sentence was attended with some degree of ambiguity, none the less, that sentence provided for an overall sentence on the six counts, in effect of a total sentence of seven years to commence 13 May, 1999, and a minimum term under the then existing legislation of five years from that date. By reason of the allowing of the appeal against conviction, the sentence his Honour passed on the fourth count by way of a fixed term of two years to be served concurrently with the sentence passed on the first charge, commencing 13 May 1999 and to expire 12 May 2001 will now have to be set aside and the applicant re-sentenced. 
    16   On the third charge, his Honour had imposed a sentence of penal servitude for five years cumulative upon the first sentence to consist of a minimum term of three years and an additional term of two years. The ambiguity to which I referred arises in that his Honour had passed on the first count a sentence of imprisonment of a fixed term of 15 months to commence 13 May 1999 and due to expire 12 August 2000, yet when enunciating, in the document headed ""Final Result"", produced to show the effect of his Honour's adjournment of the sentences to which I have referred the sentence on the third count, his Honour expressed that sentence to commence on 13 May 2001 and the minimum term to expire 12 May 2004. The additional term was to expire on 12 May 2006. 
    17   It becomes apparent therefore that his Honour has expressed that sentence to be cumulative upon the sentence which, by way of fixed term, expired on 12 May, 2001. That was the sentence on the fourth count, that on which I consider the Court should allow the appeal against conviction. It will therefore be necessary to adjust the sentence for the third charge in particular. 
    18   I should note that on the second count his Honour imposed a fixed term of 18 months to be served concurrently with that imposed on the first count, on the fifth count his Honour fixed the term of four months to be served concurrently and on the sixth charge a fixed term of six months to be served concurrently. 
    19   His Honour had found special circumstances and the statutory relationship had been varied by his Honour to a limited extent because of that finding. Both parties submit and I accept that there are those special circumstances here. 
    20   The offences in their nature were very grave indeed. At the time of the first of the offences charged the victim was between the ages of five and six and the offender was between the ages of 46 and 47. The offender had grossly abused the trust reposed in him as a relative and had sought to pervert the young boy in his care. The age disparity was a matter to which his Honour expressly adverted when referring to the gravity of the crime, and accompanying the crimes were activities by which it appeared the offender was seeking to educate the child towards the offender's particular sexual disposition. 
    21   When the second offence occurred the victim was about nine and the offender aged about 50. The third offence, that of buggery, was an offence which was committed in circumstances showing a complete disregard for the victim and an intent that the offender would engage in that particular form of sexual conduct with the young person, notwithstanding the pain that it caused to the victim. Again it was an offence committed, as they all were, in serious breach of trust. 
    22   The fourth offence involved a serious invasion of the body. The seriousness of that offence was reflected in the fixed term of two years imprisonment his Honour imposed, notwithstanding that sentence was concurrent with all but the sentence on count three. It cannot be said that offence and the subsequent sentence did not occupy, by reason of the concurrence that his Honour ordered, a substantial position in the hierarchy of offences he was considering. That sentence bore substantial weight in the overall sentence. 
    23   The fifth offence was when the victim was about 11 and the applicant about 52. The sixth and final offence was an offence which was committed apparently when the victim was about 12 years old and the applicant about 53. 
    24   It becomes apparent when considering these matters as a series that there was a continuing and extensive breach of trust over the years. His Honour found the offences had a marked and unfortunate effect on the victim in his later life and that amongst the other effects of that conduct was the possibility of it causing the breakdown in the victim's relationship with a particular young lady. 
    25   His Honour held that the victim had expressed contrition. He had regard to the early plea of guilty, he had regard to that plea as sparing the victim the necessity of coming to court and to the utilitarian saving to the community involved in such an early plea. 
    26   In that regard, the recent decision of this court in Regina v. Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309, assists us to consider the proper value to be attributed to a plea of guilty in those circumstances. 
    27   His Honour referred to the prisoner's subjective circumstances and his prior criminal record. That record contains offences of dishonesty but, more importantly, it refers to a conviction which pre dated the commission of these offences, in that on 28 August 1970, the applicant had been sentenced on each of five charges, of indecent assault on a male person with that sentence of nine months suspended on him entering into a recognisance that he be of good behaviour for 18 months with conditions that he undertake supervision and treatment. 
    28   In that regard the Crown has presently submitted before us that it cannot be said as a consequence that he should be treated as a person whose life so far has been blameless. 
    29   There was evidence before the trial judge, now before us, concerning the applicant having comparatively recently been estimably engaged in church activities. 
    30   The offender came forward for sentence at the age of 67, he is now 69, he would turn 70 in August next year. We have, in this regard, received his affidavit recently sworn, referring to the circumstances of his age, his present custody, which is, because of the nature of the offences and his age, in the at risk program, he having been placed on protection. 
    31   The relevance of age and the possible crushing effect of a sentence on a person of such age being in custody for an extensive period, has been referred to in the decisions in Regina v. Holyoak (1995) 82 A. Crim. R. 502 and Regina v. Yates (1985) VR 43. His Honour found that the sentence he was imposing was liable to be more onerous upon the applicant than on a younger person. His Honour does not, however, seem to have had regard to the matters now in evidence before us, as to the prisoner finding the sentence more onerous because of having to serve it in circumstances of strict protection. 
    32   The court is confronted with the necessity when sentencing for a series of offences of this kind, to have sufficient regard for the general deterrent component required in sentences for crimes of such severity and gravity. As his Honour said, the community is entitled to expect those who are minded to commit these offences will understand that when they are discovered they will be dealt with and dealt with severely. Those remarks were made particularly in the context of the offences going, because of the understandable attitude of the victim, undiscovered for so many years and only having come forward to be considered when the perpetrator is of some considerable age. 
    33   It is also necessary too that while having regard to the principles of totality this court should deal with the offences in accordance with the decision of the High Court in Pearce v. The Queen (1998) 72 ALJR 146, with particular regard that individual sentences reflect the individual crimes. 
    34   It seems to me that the sentences, except for that on count four, and the findings of special circumstances, having had regard to the matters to which I have referred, should be maintained, although it will be necessary to interfere with his Honour's decision to cumulate in the way in which he did to reflect the necessary variation by reason of the quashing of the conviction on count four. 
    35   For my part, I am of the view that having regard to the principle of totality and to the particular sentences necessary on each count, cumulation on the sentence passed on count five, would meet the exigencies so that the existing sentences should remain undisturbed but on count three, in lieu of the commencement date of the non-parole period to which his Honour referred, that period should commence on 13 May 2000, ie., after the expiry of the sentence on count five, and expire on 12 May 2003. 
    36   The sentence itself should expire on 12 May 2005. That would mean that the earliest release date would be 12 May 2003. Such a result would make it unnecessary to consider further the other criticisms raised in the applicant's written submissions. 
    37   The orders, therefore, I would propose are, in regard to the conviction on count four, allow the extension of time to appeal, allow the appeal, quash the conviction and sentence and direct an acquittal. 
    38   As to the application for leave to appeal against sentence, I would allow leave to appeal against sentence and allow the appeal to the extent that the sentence on count three should be directed as cumulative upon the sentence passed on count five. That sentence would now be expressed in accordance with the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and should be expressed as a sentence of five years imprisonment with a non-parole term of three years to commence on 13 May 2000 with a non-parole period to expire on 12 May, 2003. 
    39   PRIESTLEY, JA: I agree. 
    40   KIRBY, J: I also agree. 
    41   PRIESTLEY, JA: The orders of the court are those announced by Greg James, J.

      Glen Lawrence MACDONNELL 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: This matter came before the Court on 11 September 2000 as a matter of urgency, by reason of the impending trial date in the District Court of the respondent. 
    2   The subject application is an unusual one in that it is an application by the New South Wales Crimes Commission (“the applicant”), pursuant to s 10(5)(b) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act, 1990 (as amended) (“the Act”), that the restraining order made on 3 March 1998 in relation to assets of Glen Lawrence MacDonnell (“the respondent”) be further varied to provide for the payment of not more than $75,000 out of the sale of the interest of the respondent in the property, 73 McKenzie Street, Concord West, for the reasonable legal expenses in connection with the criminal trial of the respondent, such payment to be made to the Legal Aid Commission. 
    3   The respondent was charged with conspiracies to supply large commercial quantities of heroin and methylamphetamine. Following a committal proceeding in the Local Court, which occupied some nineteen days, the respondent was committed for trial in the District Court on 5 April 2000. The trial date was originally fixed for 9 October 2000, with an estimated duration of six weeks. However, on the application of the respondent, Justice Blanch, the Chief Judge of the District Court, on 8 September, relisted the hearing to commence on 23 October 2000.  
    4   The respondent is married to Tania Lee MacDonnell, although they have been separated since 1999. There are two young daughters of the marriage aged 7 years and 5 years respectively. 
    5   Since August 1999, the respondent has been represented by Mr Chris Watson, solicitor, and Mrs MacDonnell and the children have been represented by Mr John Bettens, solicitor. Prior to August 1999, Mr Watson appeared for both the respondent and Mrs MacDonnell. 
    6   On 3 March 1999, a restraining order was made pursuant to s 10 of the Act, over the property of the respondent and Mrs MacDonnell which included their respective interests in the matrimonial home (“the home”) at 73 McKenzie Street, Concord West.  
    7   On 30 August 1999, an application for summary judgment was made by the New South Wales Crime Commission to this Court in respect of the interests in the home of Mrs MacDonnell. 
    8   On that date, an ex parte order was made, pursuant to s 22 of the Act, that the interests of Mrs MacDonnell in the home be forfeited and vest in the Crown (the assets forfeiture order). 
    9   Execution of the assets forfeiture order was stayed for six months after it took effect and in the event of an application being made under either s 25 or s 26 (or both) of the Act. 
    10   Leave was granted to Mrs MacDonnell to apply for orders under s 25 or s 26 (or both) of the Act within six months after the assets forfeiture order took effect. 
    11   I merely note, without comment, that the present respondent contends that such orders were irregularly obtained. 
    12   The respondent’s solicitor requested the applicant to agree to the setting aside of those orders but it has declined to do so. 
    13   However, on 28 August 2000, an application was filed in this Court by Denise Elaine Boyde as tutor for the children of the marriage (the interveners) for an order that the forfeiture orders of 30 August 1999, relating to the assets of Mrs MacDonnell be set aside. Further, pursuant to s 24 of the Act, an amount of $550,000 be paid out of the proceeds of sale of the home to prevent hardship to the children of the marriage. It is proposed that such amount be paid into a trust fund for the children with Denise Elaine Boyde as trustee. That application is set down for hearing on 9 October 2000. 
    14   Pursuant to the order of this Court on 30 August 1999, the Public Trustee is now on the title in place of Mrs MacDonnell, with the Public Trustee and the respondent now being registered as joint tenants. 
    15   Mrs MacDonnell and the children are presently living in the home and their occupation is secure, despite the proposed sale of the home, until at least 15 February 2001. 
    16   Mr Temby QC, who appears for the applicant in these proceedings, and Mr Watson, who appears for the respondent, agree that the value of the respondent’s interest in the home is estimated to be between $350,000 and $400,000. 
    17   The restraining order with respect to the respondent’s property has already been varied, by consent, to make provision for the costs of the respondent’s legal representation in the committal proceedings. The present proceedings are concerned with the costs of his legal representation in the District Court trial. Mr Watson has estimated that, on the basis of a six weeks trial, with himself instructing a competent junior counsel, an allowance of $215,000 should be made for legal representation. 
    18   On 29 August, Mr Watson wrote to the applicant requesting its consent to the restraining order being varied to allow provision for the “reasonable legal expenses” of the respondent in the sum of $215,000, pursuant to s 10(5)(b) of the Act. Such request was refused. 
    19   It is convenient to note at this stage that, at an earlier date, the respondent had applied to the Legal Aid Commission for representation at the trial. However, by letter dated 21 August 2000, the Commission refused the application “after careful consideration” in reliance upon s 34(1) of the Legal Aid Commission Act, 1979, because the respondent was not eligible under the Commission’s means test. No appeal to the Legal Aid Review Committee was lodged by the respondent against that refusal. 
    20   Thus, in a reply dated 1 September to the letter dated 29 August from Mr Watson, Mr Giorgiutti, the solicitor to the applicant, stated that he had spoken to Mr Humphries from the Legal Aid Commission who indicated to him that Legal Aid would be granted on the basis of a 100 per cent contribution from the respondent and on a condition that the Legal Aid Commission had security for the contribution. In those circumstances, all that would be necessary would be for the present consent orders permitting sale of the property to be varied to provide “for payment to the Legal Aid Commission for the extent of the contribution”. 
    21   Mr Watson responded on 4 September in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
       “Thank you for your letter dated 1 September 2000 which I saw this morning. I see that your powers of persuasion have been bought to bear on Doug Humphries. 
       
      
      
       
       As my client has an equity of apparently $350,000.00 in the jointly owned property, and is well able to pay his own legal costs, I am at a loss to understand why this firm should be required to underwrite Mr. MacDonnell’s legal costs by conducting the trial on legal aid, when Mr. MacDonnell is well able to afford to pay normal legal costs. 
       
      
      
       
       If Mr. MacDonnell is able to enter into the appropriate security for legal aid, he could well do so for this firm’s costs and expenses. The 100% contribution by him to the Legal Aid Commission rather than this office may have the effect of preserving a larger fund for other competing claims but it does so at our expense and reduces the available pool of Counsel willing to accept a brief. I am sure that most Counsel prefer to be paid full fees, albeit at a later date, than legal aid rates, for payment of which they invariably have to wait in any event. 
       
      
      
       
       If the Orders are to be varied as proposed, please advise by return facsimile whether there is any objection to varying the Orders to enable our normal fees to be paid as set out in my letter to you. I will thereafter seek the views of the legal representatives of Mrs. MacDonnell and the children if there is no objection.” 
       
      
    22   The applicant has taken the view that by reason of the application on behalf of the children which is presently on foot, it is unable to consent to an order for “reasonable legal expenses” in the sum of $215,000 as sought by the respondent. The applicant takes the view that, assuming the application by the children is successful, there would, in relation to the respondent, remain in his estate only an amount of $75,000. Accordingly, the Commission took the view that it is only able to consent to an order for reasonable legal expenses for the trial up to $75,000. 
    23   The applicant then sought an assurance from the Legal Aid Commission that it would grant legal aid for the respondent’s trial on the basis of a 100 per cent contribution from the respondent’s estate and that would be the maximum contribution which the respondent would be required to make regardless of the ultimate cost of the legal representation. 
    24   On 8 September, Mr Humphries, on behalf of the Legal Aid Commission, wrote to the applicant in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
       “I refer to your letter of 7 September 2000 in respect of the abovementioned matter. I confirm that the Legal Aid Commission is prepared to grant legal aid for Mr MacDonnell’s trial on the basis of a 100% contribution from Mr. MacDonnell’s estate. 
       
      
      
       
       I confirm that the contribution sought will be the cost to the Legal Aid Commission which has been estimated as not exceeding $75,000.00. Should this amount be exceeded, the Commission will not seek any further contribution from MacDonnell’s estate. 
       
      
      
       
       I would be grateful if you could confirm, following your appearance in Court today, that all necessary steps have been put in place to ensure the Commission’s contribution is secured.” 
       
      
    25   Thereupon, as a matter of urgency, the applicant filed the subject Notice of Motion. The application has been strenuously resisted by Mr Watson on behalf of the respondent. However, Ms Backman of counsel, who appeared before me on behalf of the interveners has raised no objection to the application. It is convenient to note at this stage that Ms Backman is of the view that there is a distinct possibility that the interveners’ application will not be in a position to proceed on 9 October because she considers that it will probably be necessary to join the State of New South Wales as a respondent. 
    26   In summary, Mr Temby submitted that there were three possibilities that could be identified. Firstly, that there will be no provision made for funding in which event, presumably, the trial will simply not proceed. 
    27   Secondly, that the applicant “should be ordered to pay the estimated cost of the trial on a fully-funded basis, which is the figure of $215,000”, although there is no application to that end before the Court. That, it was submitted, would be an unsatisfactory situation because it would severely diminish the available funds, the subject of the restraining order. It would constitute nearly two-thirds of the available restrained but unforfeited property. 
    28   The third possibility is that the application be granted and that the $75,000 be made available to the Legal Aid Commission out of the proceeds of sale of the home when the sale is effected. That, the applicant contends, is the appropriate outcome. 
    29   Thus, Mr Temby contended, the application should be granted which would leave the respondent in a position to decide what he was going to do. The matter next comes before the District Court for mention on 15 September. The matter will then be within the province of the District Court Judge presiding over the directions hearing, and it will be a question for the respondent as to what application he is minded to make to the Judge. 
    30   I turn then to the matters raised by Mr Watson for the respondent in argument. 
    31   Firstly, it was argued that this application should be stood over until after the interveners’ proceedings have been resolved in this Court. It was argued by Mr Watson that if the interveners are successful, there will be a larger fund available to them from which an appropriate allowance to mitigate their hardship will be available. Further, that the sum of $215,000, estimated to be the reasonable legal expenses of the respondent if privately represented, would necessarily represent a smaller percentage of the enlarged fund than by reference to the existing fund still the subject of the restraining order. 
    32   Ms Backman realistically outlined to the Court difficulties, from a legal point of view, which the interveners face by reason of the particular provisions of the Act and the events which have occurred, in successfully pursuing the proceedings, which in all probability would not be in a position to proceed, for the reasons I have mentioned earlier, on 9 October 2000. 
    33   It is not appropriate for me to attempt to resolve the various legal complications which flow from the interveners’ proceedings, their likely success or otherwise, and the impact which success or failure will have on the quantum of funds ultimately available to the interveners and the respondent. 
    34   To my mind, it is out of the question to stand the instant proceedings over until such time (whenever that may be) as the interveners’ proceedings will have ultimately been resolved. This matter must be dealt with in the light of the existing circumstances. 
    35   It was then argued that the order which the applicant seeks is not open upon a proper construction of s 10(5)(b) of the Act. I cannot accept that submission. In all the circumstances, the order sought can be categorised, in my opinion, as one to make provision for meeting out of the property, to which the restraining order applies, the reasonable legal expenses of the applicant incurred in defending a criminal charge, to use the words of the subsection. 
    36   It was then contended that, in effect, the applicant has made an application to the Legal Aid Commission on behalf of the respondent, which it did not have the standing to make. I am unable, however, to find anything in the Legal Aid Commission Act which would prohibit the steps which the applicant has taken with regard to the Legal Aid Commission. Indeed, it is clear from a letter, dated 10 September 2000, from Mr Humphries to Mr Watson, that there is a sensible modus vivendi between the Legal Aid Commission and the New South Wales Crime Commission, insofar as the provision of legal aid is concerned to persons subject to restraining orders. It is not necessary to consider the detail of those arrangements for present purposes. 
    37   It was also submitted that this application could not be granted by reason of the provisions of s 16A(1)(b) of the Act which provide that it is a restriction to a restraining order making provision for the payment of any legal expenses of a person in relation to any particular interest in property if the Supreme Court is satisfied that the interest is illegally acquired property. 
    38   I do not consider that this is an impediment in the instant case because there is no evidence before me upon which I could be satisfied that the relevant property is “illegally acquired property”. 
    39   One other matter is worthy of mention and that is that it should not be overlooked that the applicant, himself, made an application to the Legal Aid Commission for legal aid. There is no evidence before me to explain why, from his point of view, his attitude has now changed to one in which he is averse to accepting legal representation on a legally aided basis. 
    40   It should also be reiterated that there is no opposition by counsel for the interveners, whose interests she would be sedulous to protect, to the order sought by the applicant being granted. 
    41   Other matters were raised during the course of argument, all of which I have considered. Time constraints prevent a more detailed elaboration of the competing propositions which were put to the Court. However, they have all been considered. 
    42   I am satisfied that there is no legal impediment to my making the order which is sought by the applicants and in the circumstances as they are presented to me, I consider it prudent that the application be granted, and my discretion should be exercised to that effect. Accordingly, there will be orders in terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Notice of Motion dated 8 September 2000, namely: 
     
      
     1. Pursuant to section 10(5)(b) of the  
     Criminal Assets Recovery Act, 1990 
      (“the Act”) that the restraining order made on 3 March 1998 be further varied to provide for the payment of not more than $75,000, out of the sale of the interest of Glen Lawrence MacDonnell in the property 73 McKenzie Street, Concord West, for the reasonable legal expenses in connection with the criminal trial of Glen Lawrence MacDonnell such payment to be made to the Legal Aid Commission. 
      
      
     2. The respondent to pay the applicant’s costs.

      REGINA v NOEL JOSEPH MERRITT 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
    1   BEAZLEY JA: I agree with O’Keefe J 
    2   O’KEEFE J:  This is an appeal by the Crown against two sentences of imprisonment imposed on Noel Joseph Merritt (the prisoner) by Luland DCJ on 24 March, 2000. The ground of appeal is that the two sentences are inadequate. 
    3   On 16 March 2000 the prisoner was convicted of two offences, namely: 
     
      
     1. On 13 September, 1995 being armed with an offensive weapon, namely a sawn off rifle, he assaulted Robert Leggett with intent to rob him, and at the time of the assault wounded him (the first offence); 
      
      
     2. On or about 13 September, 1995 he stole a motor vehicle (second offence). 
      
    4   On 24 March, 2000 Luland DCJ sentenced him to a minimum term of nine years to commence on 2 June, 1999 and expire on 1 June, 2008 and an additional term of five years to commence on 2 June, 2008 and expire on 1 June, 2013 in respect of the first offence and a fixed term of twelve months to commence on 2 June, 1999 in respect of the second offence. The date of 2 June, 1999 was the day following the date of expiry of a minimum term of imprisonment which the prisoner was then serving in respect of a charge of escaping from custody. 
    5   The trial of the prisoner before Luland DCJ was his second for the two offences on which he was convicted, having been previously convicted on 1 August, 1997 for those offences as well as for an offence of escaping from lawful custody. The previous convictions on the two matters now before the Court were set aside by the Court of Criminal Appeal (Wood CJ at CL, James and Adams JJ) on 10 March, 1999.  
    6   The circumstances of the relevant offences are that the prisoner in company with two others went to the vicinity of the then Children’s Hospital at Camperdown on 13 September, 1995 in a vehicle which had been stolen. Shortly after 10am on that day two employees of an armoured delivery service company, Messrs Malone and Leggett, were making a delivery of money to a credit union which had offices within the hospital. Mr Malone carried the money into an inner office of the credit union whilst Mr Leggett stood guard at the door which led into the credit union offices from a corridor of the hospital. Whilst standing guard he was attacked by one of the persons accompanying the prisoner and in the course of the struggle a sawn off rifle being carried by that person was discharged and Mr Leggett was shot in the lower abdomen.  
    7   As Mr Leggett’s assailant stood over him, Mr Malone saw the prisoner in the credit union offices. Mr Malone thereupon fired a number of shots at both the prisoner and Mr Leggett’s assailant and then chased them when they sought to escape. The two men ran from the building. It was apparent that Mr Leggett’s assailant had been wounded by Mr Malone’s shots but he escaped in a car driven by the third person, who had been waiting in the car obviously ready to make a get away. 
    8   The prisoner made his escape by running across Bridge Road into the car parking area of a block of Housing Commission flats opposite the hospital. There he discarded what was later found to be a balaclava, a latex glove and a beanie head covering. The glove was found to bear his finger prints. 
    9   The prisoner was not apprehended until January, 1996. On arrest it was found that he too had been wounded by the shots fired by Mr Malone. However, the prisoner sought to explain the scars left by the bullet wounds on the basis that he had injured himself when he fell on a fence.  
    10   Notwithstanding a strong Crown case and the fact that two juries had convicted him of the offences the subject of the present appeal, the prisoner attacked the jury’s finding and showed no remorse. Indeed, as is apparent from the transcript of what passed between the prisoner and Luland DCJ on 17 and 24 March, 2000, the prisoner sought to portray himself as the victim rather than Mr Leggett, argued against the jury’s verdict, largely on the basis that the evidence against him was circumstantial. He claimed further that the jury was bored and had given no consideration to or displayed any interest in him as the accused person before them. He also attacked the jury and hence its verdict saying that “they could be racist against my culture, they could be racist against a number of things”.(AB 015).  
    11   He criticised his legal representation on the basis that “they have a relationship to protect the interest of the Crown and the police allegations. They haven’t got no interest in protecting the social or legal rights of an accused person who maintains he is innocent.” In imposing the sentences Luland DCJ commented: 
     
      
       
       “The prisoner shows absolutely no remorse for his offence. From his remarks to me following his Counsel’s submission and here again today he continues to express his non-acceptance of the laws of this country as having application to him”  
       
      
    12   In my opinion this is a fair summary of the attitude of the prisoner as manifest by his behaviour at the time of the crimes of which he was convicted, subsequent thereto and at his trial before Luland DCJ. 
    13   The first offence is, of its very essence, grave. The circumstances of its commission mark it out as extremely so. Freeman DCJ, the trial judge at the first trial of the prisoner described the first offence “as being an appalling crime”. Luland DCJ in describing its seriousness said: 
     
      
       
       “One needs say nothing further as to the seriousness of the robbery and wounding charge other than to confirm and accept the remarks by Judge Freeman and also to have (sic) note as to what the Court of Criminal Appeal said when it determined the matter and said it regarded this offence as towards the upper end of seriousness.”  
       
      
    14   The prisoner has a very bad record, extending back to his days as a juvenile. It has progressed through stealing offences to having explosives in his possession, possessing unlicensed firearms, escaping from custody and ultimately to a number of offences of robbery whilst armed (3), armed assault with intent to rob whilst wounding and robbery in company. In respect of these last mentioned offences he was sentenced to substantial terms of imprisonment in 1976, 1980, 1984, 1985 and 1990, but appears to have learnt nothing from such sentences.  
    15   At his first trial for the offences presently under consideration, Freeman DCJ sentenced the prisoner to a minimum term of nine years with an additional term of five years in respect of the first offence . In respect of the second offence the prisoner was sentenced to a fixed term of twelve months to be served concurrently with the other sentence. 
    16   From the convictions and sentences that resulted from the first trial, both the prisoner and the Crown appealed. As the prisoner was successful in his appeal in relation to his conviction it was unnecessary for the Court of Criminal Appeal to make a final determination in respect of the inadequacy of the sentence that had been imposed upon him by Freeman DCJ. However, in the course of the judgment the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to the attitude of the prisoner to the laws of the State and adverted to his previous convictions . The judgment records that the prisoner said : 
     
      
       
       “I have never accepted a conviction against me. I have never acknowledged that I was guilty in any way. I am not guilty. I am still not guilty and I will always be not guilty … that’s my state of mind now and that will be my state of mind ten years, twenty years, that will be my state of mind until the day I die.” (para 83) 
       
      
    17   However, notwithstanding the above reference the Court stressed that: 
     
      
       
       “It would be completely inappropriate to punish the appellant more harshly for having expressed his defiance of the law and attempting to justify his behaviour by rejecting the notion that by committing crimes against his fellow citizen … he had done something wrong. At the same time, the mitigation is lacking that would otherwise be present where there is genuine contrition to ameliorate the severity of a sentence determined largely by the objective seriousness of the offence, the need to protect the community and the requirement of general and personal deterrents.” (para 91) 
       
      
    18   In the result the Court was of the view that: 
     
      
       
       “Giving due consideration to the maximum penalty provided by law the sentence passed by the Court below was so lenient as to indicate a failure by the learned sentencing judge properly to apply his discretion.” (para 92) 
       
      
    19   Although these last remarks are strictly obiter dicta, I respectfully agree with and adopt them as a proper description of the sentence imposed by Freeman DCJ. In his reasons for sentence Luland DCJ expressed the view that the sentence imposed by Freeman DCJ “does not reflect the seriousness of the offence”, but nonetheless felt “constrained from imposing any greater sentence,” having regard to the principles enunciated in R v Gilmore (1979) 1 ACR 416 and R v Bedford (1986) 5 NSWLR 711.  
    20   It has been submitted on behalf of the Crown that Luland DCJ fell into appellable error in determining the sentence that he should impose of the prisoner and that as the sentence imposed was inadequate this Court should review it. 
    21   The imposition of a sentence to a term of imprisonment depends upon the exercise of a judicial discretion by the court imposing it. The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of such a discretion should be determined is governed by well established principles. It is not enough that the judges constituting the appellate court consider that if they had been in the position of the judge who imposed the sentence, they would have imposed a different sentence. As was said in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499: 
     
      
       
       “It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts on a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred.” (at 505 per Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ) 
       
      
    22   See also Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Limited (1985-86) 162 CLR 24. 
    23   Since Luland DCJ “felt constrained” not to impose a heavier sentence than the trial judge at the first trial of the prisoner for the offences now before the Court, it is necessary to examine the basis that he relied on for such constraint, namely the decisions in  R v Gilmore (supra ) and  R v Bedford (supra ). 
    24   R v Gilmore was an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed as a consequence of Gilmore’s conviction on two counts of maliciously throwing an explosive substance into a building with intent to cause damage, one count of demanding money with menaces and one of throwing an explosive substance near a vehicle with intent to cause damage.  
    25   The sentences appealed against had been imposed following a second trial. At the first trial , which had been presided over by another judge , sentences aggregating 8 years with a non-parole period of 3 years had been imposed. Although the convictions at the first trial were the subject of appeal, no appeal was instituted in respect of the sentences and there was no suggestion that such sentences were other than appropriate. However, at the second trial the sentences imposed aggregated 14 years with a non-parole period of 6½ years. There was thus a very substantial disparity between the sentences resulting from each of the trials. 
    26   Street CJ, with whom Lusher J agreed, examined the statutory provisions in England which gave to the English Court of Criminal Appeal’s power to order a new trial and noted that where a first conviction is quashed on appeal the English legislation imposes a statutory limit upon the sentence that may be imposed on the new trial. That sentence may not be “a sentence of greater gravity than that passed on the original conviction” (Criminal Appeal Act 1968 (UK) s.8(4) and Sch 2 par 2(1)). He said that there were policy considerations underlying the specification of the upper limit on the sentence, namely that a person whose conviction was defective should not be required to run a risk of suffering a heavier sentence on a new trial, it being wrong that a person may feel constrained not to expose the defect lest on a new trial a heavier sentence is imposed .  
    27   Secondly, if a heavier sentence is imposed on a new trial , it could be seen as possibly importing some element of retribution by the machinery of criminal justice in consequence of the conviction on the first trial having been successfully overturned. Although such a perception would be groundless, it is in the interests of justice to avoid such a perception which could expose the criminal justice system to criticism. 
    28   The policy considerations that underlay the English legislation were, as Street CJ pointed out, the basis of a principle or policy of sentencing. It was in this context that Street CJ said: 
     
      
       
       “It is a sound principle of sentencing that on a new trial consequent upon the quashing of a conviction by the Court of Criminal Appeal, the accused should ordinarily not receive a longer sentence or non-parole period than those following upon the first trial” (supra at 419); 
       
      
     and 
      
       
       “… so far as concerns the head sentence, that passed on the first trial should ordinarily not be exceeded if the new trial results in conviction again” (id). 
       
      
    29   The formulation of this statement is not the formulation of a fixed principle of law. The context of the judgment in which it occurs as well as its form, in my opinion, make it clear that what is being stated in the proposition referred to above is a principle or policy that is not inflexible, but rather one that expresses the prima facie situation, the application of which will yield in an appropriate case (supra at 419). The use of the word “ordinarily” also highlights this, as does the use of the word “should” in relation to the application of the principle or policy. 
    30   The statement in R v Gilmore  has been applied frequently in New South Wales and has been adhered to notwithstanding that in some other States a different principle or policy has been applied. That there was a divergence between States (e.g. Garrett (1978) 18 SASR 308) was considered by the New South Wales Court, but this did not deter the New South Wales Court from stating the principle or policy referred to above. 
    31   That the Court did not intend that R v Gilmore should be regarded as absolutely depriving a judge on a second trial of any discretion in relation to the sentence to be imposed is demonstrated by R v Bedford (1985-1986) 5 NSWLR 711. In that case the Court of Criminal Appeal (Street CJ, Slattery CJ at CL and Brownie J) considered an appeal against the sentences imposed following a second trial in respect of a number of sexual offences of which the appellant had been previously convicted. The sentences imposed following the second trial were such that when regard was had to the non-parole period fixed in each case the appellant would have to serve a greater period of imprisonment than he would have been required to serve under the sentence imposed at the first trial. It was argued that this was an infringement of the principle stated in R v Gilmore (supra). As a consequence the Court examined what it was that  R v Gilmore actually decided.  
    32   Street CJ, with whom Slattery CJ at CL and Brownie J agreed , said: 
     
      
       
       “It is significant to emphasise that the enunciation of the principle includes “should ordinarily not receive”. The word “ordinarily” must be given full room to operate. It might perhaps have been preferable to have expressed this as a prima facie approach rather than elevating it to principle.” (at 713-714) 
       
      
    33   The approach referred to in R v Gilmore when correctly understood in the light of the explanation in R v Bedford means that: 
     
      
       
       “Where the judge at the new trial considers that the circumstances of the case do call for a longer sentence he will not be absolutely fettered by the prime facie approach to be adopted. He is both at liberty, and indeed obliged, to give effect to his own assessment. It could be expected, however, that, if he did take the view that a longer sentence were called for than that passed at the first trial, then there would be a specific indication of the reasons leading him to that view.” ( 
       R v Bedford 
        supra at 714). 
       
      
    34   Street CJ gave a number of examples of situations in which the sentence on the second trial may properly be higher that that imposed at the first trial. These included the existence of particular subjective elements or “a multiplicity of factors” (at 714) which could lead to a departure from the prima facie situation. One situation in which the prime facie situation established by the sentence imposed at the first trial may be departed from would be where the sentence imposed at the first trial was remarkably lenient. In my opinion, another would be where the sentence imposed at the first trial was such that had it been the subject of an appeal, either by the Crown or an accused person, it have been such as to bespeak intervention by the Court of Criminal Appeal on the ground that it was either inadequate or excessive. A sentence which is “remarkably lenient” will usually be inadequate. 
    35   Furthermore, the Court stressed that “(w)hat was described as a principle ordinarily to be followed will not prevent such a departure” (ibid). 
    36   The sentence imposed by Freeman DCJ was in my opinion inadequate and such as to bespeak intervention on appeal by the Court of Criminal Appeal. That was the view taken by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the prisoner’s first appeal, albeit in obiter dicta. It is the view which I hold in respect of the sentence. In my opinion this means that Luland DCJ was not, in the circumstances of the present case, constrained to impose a sentence less than he thought appropriate in the proper exercise of his discretion as the sentencing judge. He used as the yardstick of the sentence imposed by him a sentence which was so inadequate as to be open to being set aside. There was no constraint on Luland DCJ to do so in the present case. His sentencing on the basis that there was, constitutes an error of law in the exercise of his discretion of a kind described in House v The King (supra). 
    37   For the foregoing reasons I am of opinion that Luland DCJ fell into error in exercising his discretion to impose the sentence on the first offence. The Crown appeal in respect of the sentence imposed in relation to the first offence should therefore be allowed and the sentence imposed in respect of it should be quashed. 
    38   In R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 the Court of Criminal Appeal (Spigelman CJ, Wood CJ at CL, Newman, Hulme and Simpson JJ) laid down guidelines for sentencing in relation to offences under s.97 of the Crimes Act 1900. Spigelman CJ set out a number of circumstances particular to the offence of armed robbery to be taken into account in fixing a sentence. These include: 
     
      
     “i. nature of the weapon; 
      
     ii. vulnerability of the victim; 
      
     iii. position on a scale of impulsiveness/planning; 
      
     iv. intensity of threat or actual use of force; 
      
     v. number of offenders; 
      
     vi. amount taken 
      
     vii. effect on victim(s).” (at 381) 
      
    39   The first offence was extremely grave, both in its nature and its characteristics. A firearm was used. It had been cut down making it more readily concealable but no less dangerous. Mr Leggett was vulnerable by virtue of being a carrier and protector of money . Three people were involved in the commission of the offence. The involvement of those people, the use of a get away car, the fact that one of the perpetrators remained in the car to facilitate quick escape and the means taken by way of dress and gloves to conceal identity all indicated a high degree of planning for the carrying out of the crime. Considerable force was used. A weapon was discharged resulting in Mr Leggett being shot in the abdomen. The weapon was discharged in a situation in which others, including children, and other members of the public attending the hospital as well as hospital staff, had the potential to be involved. On the scale of seriousness the circumstances are in the zone of extreme gravity. This means that the element of retribution is significant in fixing the sentence. 
    40   The prisoner, as indicated above, has a history of armed robbery, robbery in company and armed assault with intent to rob whilst wounding. Whilst the previous criminal history of the prisoner may be taken into account in determining his sentence, it cannot be given such weight as to give rise to a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence. However, such history is relevant to show that the offender has demonstrated a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In such a case retribution, deterrence and protection of society may indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. Where such record shows a dangerous propensity on the part of the prisoner or the need to impose well-merited punishment to deter him or others from committing similar offences it is appropriate to take it into account. 
    41   In Veen v The Queen (1987-88) 164 CLR 465 it was said: 
     
      
       
       “… the antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences:  
       Director of Public Prosecutions v Ottewell 
       . The antecedent criminal history is relevant to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence, and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind.” (at 477 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) 
       
      
    42   In view of the extreme gravity of the offence, the absence of mitigating factors, the maximum sentence provided by Parliament, namely 25 years, the fact that, to adopt the words of the Court of Criminal Appeal on the first appeal, it was an offence the circumstances of which “place it well towards the upper end of seriousness” for the type of crime in question, the need for appropriate retribution, the deterrence of others and the protection of society, the correct sentence is one of 18 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 13 ½ years to commence at the expiration of the minimum term of the sentence for escaping from lawful custody. 
    43   The sentence imposed by Luland DCJ in respect of the second offence, larceny of a motor vehicle, falls within the parameters of discretion open to him. In my opinion no error is disclosed in respect of the sentence imposed by Luland DCJ in respect of the second offence. The fact that the vehicle was stolen for the purposes of the first offence combined with the principle of totality in my opinion make it appropriate that such sentence should be served concurrently with the sentence for the first offence. 
    44   I propose the following orders: 
     
      
     (1) Appeal against sentence for the second offence of larceny dismissed; 
      
      
     (2) Appeal against sentence for the first offence of armed robbery with wounding allowed; sentence` quashed; 
      
      
     (3) In lieu of the sentence imposed for armed robbery with wounding Noel Joseph Merritt is sentenced to imprisonment for 18 years commencing on 2 June 1999 with a non parole period of 13 ½ years commencing that day and ending on 1 December 2012 on which day Noel Joseph Merritt is eligible for release on parole. 
      
    45   SMART AJ: I agree with O’Keefe J.

       McCONNELL DOWELL CONSTRUCTORS (AUST) PTY LIMITED v ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AUTHORITY 
       
       
      
    Pearlman J stated seven questions for determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Her Honour had delivered a judgment dealing with interlocutory matters including whether a summons issued by the prosecutor should be struck out as an abuse of process in proceedings commenced in the Land and Environment Court by the Environment Protection Authority against McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd.Held:(Per Spigelman CJ, Grove J and Kirby J agreeing)1 Did I err in finding that the decision of the Director General of the Environment Protection Authority is a decision that is not reviewable by a Court?The Court should decline to answer this question as it is hypothetical. 
     
      
       
       
       
      
    2 Did I err in finding that the Summons disclosed properly the essential ingredients of an offence against the Environmental Offences and Penalties Act 1989 and s16(1) of the Clean Waters Act 1970?Yes. The Summons did not identify an act of polluting which is an essential factual ingredient of the offence. Stanton v Abernathy  (1990) 19 NSWLR 656, Taylor v Environment Protection Authority [2000] NSWCCA 71, Environment Protection Authority v Bathurst City Council (1995) 89 LGERA 79 applied.Vicarious liability is not an ingredient of an offence under s16(1) of the Clean Waters Act 1970.3 Did I err in finding that the proceedings were properly commenced on 24 February 1999?The Court should decline to answer this question as no submissions were addressed to it by the Defendant.4 Did I err in finding that the EPA could rely upon the affidavits of Mr David Blair sworn 9 September 1998, Mr Andrew Hawkins sworn 17 February 1999 and Mr Mark Callaghan sworn 23 February 1999 in support of its application to Talbot J on 24 February 1999?In view of the answer to question 7 below, the Court should decline to answer the question. Whether it is a question of law within s5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act1912 doubted. 5 Did I err in finding that a prima facie proof was established on the basis of the affidavits properly relied on for the application before Talbot J on 24 February 1999?In view of the answer to question 7 below, the Court should decline to answer this question. Whether it is a question of law within s5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act1912 doubted. 6 Did I err in finding that non-compliance with the requirements of Rule 75(8) and (9) of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 was cured by s68(2) of the Land and Environment Court Act 1979?No with respect to Pt 75 r9. No reasons were advanced why s68(2)(a) should not apply. No submissions were made with respect to Pt 75 r8.7 Did I err in finding that before making an order under s41(1) of the Land and Environment Court Act 1979, a judge must be satisfied that there is a prima facie case against the Defendant?”Yes. Part 6 r2(2) of the Land and Environment Court Rules 1996 does not require a judge to be satisfied that there is a prima facie case before making an order under s41(1). The Court should not, in the absence of clear legislative intent, interpret the act or rules of a court in a manner which would give the appearance that a judge of a court performs a function closely associated with the prosecution process. Director of Public Prosecutions v Humphrys [1977] AC 1, Baker v Macleod (Land and Environment Court, 1 August 1986, unreported), Director of Public Prosecutions, South Australia v B (1998) 194 CLR 566, Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501, Barton v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 75 considered.

       McCONNELL DOWELL CONSTRUCTORS (AUST) PTY LIMITED v ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AUTHORITY 
        
       JUDGMENT 
        
       
       
       
        
       
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: On 20 May 1999 the Chief Judge of the Land and Environment Court, Pearlman J, handed down a judgment dealing with certain interlocutory matters that had arisen in the context of Class 5 proceedings commenced by the Environment Protection Authority (“the Prosecutor”) against McConnell Dowell Constructors (Aust) Pty Ltd (“the Defendant”). One of the issues that arose before her Honour was whether the summons issued by the Prosecutor against the Defendant should be struck out as an abuse of process. 
     
      
    2    Section 5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides that a Judge of the Land and Environment Court may “submit any question of law arising at or in reference to the proceedings to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination”. Subsection 5AE(2) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        ”The Court of Criminal Appeal may make any such order or give any such direction to the court concerned as it thinks fit.” 
        
       
      
    3    By a document entitled a Stated Case, Justice Pearlman submitted six questions “asked by the Defendant” and one question “asked by the Prosecutor”. The seven questions were as follows, using the denotation in the Stated Case: 
     
      
       
        
        “3(i) Did I err in finding that the decision of the Director General of the Environment Protection Authority is a decision that is not reviewable by a Court? 
        
       
       
        
        3(ii) Did I err in finding that the Summons disclosed properly the essential ingredients of an offence against the  
        Environmental Offences and Penalties Act 
         1989 and s16(1) of the  
        Clean Waters Act 
         1970? 
        
       
       
        
        3(iii) Did I err in finding that the proceedings were properly commenced on 24 February 1999? 
        
       
       
        
        3(iv) Did I err in finding that the EPA could rely upon the affidavits of Mr David Blair sworn 9 September 1998, Mr Andrew Hawkins sworn 17 February 1999 and Mr Mark Callaghan sworn 23 February 1999 in support of its application to Talbot J on 24 February 1999? 
        
       
       
        
        3(v) Did I err in finding that a  
        prima facie 
         proof was established on the basis of the affidavits properly relied on for the application before Talbot J on 24 February 1999? 
        
       
       
        
        3(vi) Did I err in finding that non-compliance with the requirements of Rule 75(8) and (9) of the  
        Supreme Court Rules 
         1970 was cured by s68(2) of the  
        Land and Environment Court Act  
        1979? 
        
       
       
        
        4(i) Did I err in finding that before making an order under s41(1) of the  
        Land and Environment Court Act 
         1979, a judge must be satisfied that there is a prima facie case against the Defendant?” 
        
       
      
    4    In her judgment Pearlman J set out the relevant factual context as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[3] The defendant has been charged with an offence against the  
        Environmental Offences and Penalties Act 
         1989 (the EOP Act) in that, on or about 25 February 1998, at Woolloomooloo Bay, it did pollute waters contrary to s16(1) of the  
        Clean Waters Act 
         1970. The summons particularised the pollutants as ‘oils; and/or wastes containing oil; and/or inflammable liquids’. It particularised the waters as being ‘Woolloomooloo Bay’.” 
        
       
      
    5    Section 16 of the Clean Waters Act 1970 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “16(1) A person shall not pollute any waters. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), a person shall be deemed to pollute waters if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the person places any matter (whether solid, liquid of gaseous) in a position where: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) it falls, descends, is washed, is blown or percolates, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) it is likely to fall, descend, be washed, be blown or percolate, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          into any waters, on to the dry bed of any waters, or into any drain, channel or gutter used or designed to receive or pass rainwater, floodwater or any water that is not polluted, or causes or permits any such matter to be placed in such a position, or 
           
           
          (b) the person places any such matter on the dry bed of any waters, or in any drain, channel or gutter used or designed to receive or pass rainwater, floodwater or any water that is not polluted, or causes or permits any such matter to be placed on such a dry bed or in such a drain, channel or gutter, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        and the matter would, had it been placed in any waters have polluted or have been likely to pollute those waters. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A person shall not cause any waters to be polluted, whether intentionally or not. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) A person shall not permit any waters to be polluted. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) (Repealed) 
        
       
       
        
        (6) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section it shall not be an offence arising under those provisions for a person to pollute any waters if he holds a licence (including a licence granted under the  
        Waste Minimisation and Management Act 
          
        1995  
        in respect of a waste facility) and does not pollute the waters in contravention of any of the conditions of the licence. 
        
       
       
        
        (7) Any person who contravenes the provisions of this section is guilty of an offence against the  
        Environmental Offences and Penalties Act 
         1989.” 
        
       
       
      Is the Director General’s Consent Reviewable? 
       
      
    6    Her Honour noted that the Court’s file contained a written consent to institute the proceedings signed on 23 February 1999 by the Director General. Section 13 of the EOP Act relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “13(1) Proceedings for an offence against this Act may be instituted only with the written consent of: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the Environment Protection Authority, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a member of the staff of that Authority authorised in writing by that Authority for the purposes of this subsection. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) (Repealed) 
        
       
       
        
        (2A) Subsection (1) does not apply to the institution of proceedings in the Land and Environment Court for an offence against this Act by a person if the Court grants the person leave to bring the proceedings. The Court is not to grant leave unless satisfied that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the Environment Protection Authority has decided not to take any relevant action (as defined in subsection (2B)) in respect of the act or omission constituting the alleged offence against this Act or has not made a decision on whether to take such action within 90 days after the person applied to the Authority for consent to institute the proceedings, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the Environment Protection Authority has been notified of the proceedings, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the proceedings are not an abuse of the process of the Court, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the particulars of the offence disclose, without any hearing of the evidence, a prima facie case of the commission of the offence against this Act. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (4) Subsection (1) does not apply to the institution of proceedings arising under the  
        Clean Waters Act 
         1970, other than proceedings for an offence referred to in section 19 of that Act: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) by a council of a local government area or an employee of a council of a local government area - if the proceedings are instituted with the consent of the council or with the written consent of such member or employee of the council as may be authorised by the council for the purposes of this subsection, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) by any other person - if the proceedings are instituted with the consent of the Water Board, the Hunter Water Board or a Water Supply Authority (within the meaning of the  
          Water Supply Authorities Act 
            
          1987 
          ) or with the written consent of such person as may be authorised by such a Board or Authority for the purposes of this subsection. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (6) This section does not apply to the issue of penalty notices under section 8G or to proceedings referred to in section 8G(6).” 
        
       
      
    7    Part 2 of the EOP Act contains a hierarchy of offences in the respective Divisions of that Part. Division 1 is concerned with Tier 1 offences. Division 2 is concerned with Tier 2 offences and Div 3 is concerned with Tier 3 offences. Section 8G, with respect to penalty notices, provides the content of Div 3 relating to the least serious of the sets of offences. Section 13(6) excludes that section from the operation of s13. Accordingly, neither the consent of the authority under s13(1), nor the consent of the Court under s13(2A), is required for alleged offences at the lowest level of the hierarchy 
     
      
    8    Section 8B provides for the level of penalties for offences of which a person is guilty by virtue of any provision of the Clean Waters Act 1970. Section 8B is found in Div 2 dealing with Tier 2 offences. 
     
      
    9    Pearlman J held that the consent of the Director-General (which pursuant to s19(2) of the Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991 is taken to have been the consent of the Environment Protection Authority) to the institution of proceedings pursuant to s13 of the EOP Act is not reviewable. In reaching this decision her Honour relied on the case law with respect to judicial review of decisions to prosecute.  
     
      
    10    Section 13 of the EOP Act provides three alternative means by which a prosecution may be brought: 
     
      
       
      (i) With the consent of the Environment Protection Authority (s13(1)). 
       
       
      (ii) Pursuant to leave of the Land and Environment Court (s13(2A)). 
       
       
      (iii) By a local government council, or certain statutory authorities, with respect to particular kinds of offences (ss13(3), (4), (5), (5A) and (5B)). 
       
      
    11    The general principle that any person may institute proceedings for a criminal offence has, from time to time, been the subject of statutory modification with respect to particular offences, requiring the consent of a government official to the institution of proceedings. In a context such as the present, the general purpose to be served by such a provision is to prevent frivolous or vexatious proceedings. (See eg Rich J in McDonnell v Smith (1918) 24 CLR 409 at 411, adopted by the Court at 412, applied by Malcolm CJ in Palos Verdes Estates Pty Ltd v Carbon (1991) 6 WAR 223 at 229. See also Berwin v Donohoe (1915) 21 CLR 1 at 24 per Isaacs J). 
     
      
    12    Such statutory provisions have been construed so as to authorise consent granted in general terms. (See eg Berwin v Donohoe supra at 26; R v Cain [1976] 1 QB 496 at 500-503; R v Bacon & Cox [1973] 1 NSWLR 87 at 94-95 esp 95A; Traveland Pty Limited v Doherty (1982) 63 FLR 41 at 47-48 and 49; Water Board v Environment Protection Authority (1994) 83 LGERA 174 at 179). 
     
      
    13    Question 3(i) in the Stated Case refers to Pearlman J’s finding that the relevant decision was not reviewable by the Court. In the course of her judgment her Honour appeared to distinguish this issue from another legal issue which had arisen before her when she said in par [16] of her judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        “This issue falls for determination upon whether the proper construction of s13(1) calls for the Director-General to be satisfied of a prima facie case before he issues a consent, and whether, in any event, his decision to issue a consent is reviewable by the Court.” 
        
       
      
    14    The words “in any event”, adopted by her Honour from the submission on the part of the Prosecutor before her Honour, suggest a distinction between the two issues. 
     
      
    15    Her Honour considered the question of whether or not the Director-General had to be satisfied that a prima facie case existed in pars [17]-[20] of her judgment at the end of which she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “20 I have concluded, for these reasons, that the consent of the Director-General is not open to challenge on the ground that he was required to be satisfied of a prima facie case, because, to the contrary, his discretion is unconfined.” 
        
       
      
    16    Her Honour went on in par [21] to address the second issue with the following introductory sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “21 However, Mrs Kelly, appearing for the prosecutor, contended that, in any event, the Director-General’s consent is not reviewable by the Court.” 
        
       
      
    17    Pearlman J referred in par [23] to English authorities which suggested some scope for judicial review “in rare or limited circumstances”. Her Honour went on to note at [24]: 
     
      
       
        
        “But even if there was a limited right of review as the English cases suggest, there are no exceptional circumstances alleged in this case to ground such a review.” 
        
       
      
    18    Mrs J Kelly who appeared for the Prosecutor submitted that this Court should not answer the first question. She said that the critical finding that her Honour made was that the Director-General’s decision was not open to review on the ground that he was required to be satisfied of a prima facie case. That matter, she submitted, was not a question stated by Pearlman J for consideration by this Court. Mrs Kelly sought to characterise her Honour’s finding that the Director-General’s decision was not reviewable as “obiter”. 
     
      
    19    Mr J Glissan QC, who appeared for the Defendant in this Court, submitted that there were circumstances in which the decision of the Director-General to give consent was reviewable and accordingly the question actually asked by her Honour should be answered “Yes”. Mr Glissan QC, however, appeared to accept that the other matter addressed by her Honour was not the subject of any question in the Stated Case and submitted that if the Applicant succeeded in relation to the question asked, then the matter should be remitted to the Land and Environment Court for argument on the issue of whether or not the section requires the Director-General to be satisfied of a prima facie case. Why the Court should do this in circumstances where her Honour had already heard and determined this very matter against the Defendant, was not made clear. 
     
      
    20    In this Court, both the Prosecutor and the Defendant proceeded on the basis that the issue of whether or not the Director-General was obliged to determine whether there was a prima facie case before giving consent, was not encompassed within question 3(i). The proposition that an unadorned statutory requirement of consent was restricted in this way has been rejected on a number of occasions. (See eg Goldsborough & Co v MacMahon (1887) 8 NSWLR 118 at 122; Oates v Attorney-General (Commonwealth) (1998) 156 ALR 1 at 7 line 5 and 8 line 10; sub nom Oates v Williams (1998) 84 FCR 348 at 354E and 355F. This issue was not considered by the High Court in Attorney-General (Commonwealth) v Oates (1999) 164 ALR 393 at [35]). 
     
      
    21    As the Court did not receive submissions on this issue it is not appropriate that we deal with it. This does, however, pose a difficulty because the only ground for “review” suggested before Pearlman J, or in this Court, was based on the proposition that no prima facie case had been presented to the Director. 
     
      
    22    The proceedings before her Honour were not proceedings for the judicial review of a decision by the Director-General to give consent to the prosecution. The proceedings before her Honour were concerned with whether or not the summons should be struck out as an abuse of process. One basis for the claim made was that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The written consent of the Director-General of the prosecutor was defective in that the Director-General could not have been satisfied that there was a prima facie case against the defendant.” [14] 
        
       
      
    23    The submission made to her Honour on behalf of the Prosecutor was made in the form that “the Director-General’s consent is not reviewable by the Court”. This submission was, in my opinion, misconceived. No part of the proceedings before the Land and Environment Court constituted in any form a “review” of the decision to grant the consent. The matter before that court was an application to strike out the summonses as an abuse of process. Insofar as the submission, which her Honour appeared to accept, suggested that the Court’s power to control abuse of its process could not be exercised on the basis of a defect in the consent process, then, in my opinion, the submission went too far. 
     
      
    24    As Gibbs ACJ and Mason J said in Barton v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 94-95: 
     
      
       
        
        “It has generally been considered to be undesirable that the court, whose ultimate function it is to determine the accused’s guilt or innocence, should become too closely involved in the question whether a prosecution should be commenced … though it may be that in exercising its power to prevent an abuse of process the court will on rare occasions be required to consider whether a prosecution should be permitted to continue.” 
        
       
      
    25    The significance of the distinction between decisions involved in a prosecution process and issues concerned with the abuse of a court’s process has been emphasised by Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Director of Public Prosecutions, South Australia v B (1998) 194 CLR 566 at 579, where their Honours said at [21]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The line between, on the one hand, the decisions whether to institute or continue criminal proceedings (which are decisions the province of the executive) and on the other, decisions directed to ensuring a fair trial of an accused and the prevention of abuse of the court’s processes (which are the province of the courts) is of fundamental importance.” 
        
       
      
    26    Their Honours went on to quote an extract from the judgment of Gummow and Gaudron JJ in Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501 at 534 where their Honours identified a number of “decisions involved in the prosecution process” which their Honours concluded were “of their nature insusceptible of judicial review”. It may well be that decisions relating to consent to prosecute pursuant to a statutory requirement of such consent, should be added to their Honours’ list. It is not necessary or desirable to determine that in this case. 
     
      
    27    However, nothing in the reasoning in Maxwell or DPP (SA) v B restricts the scope of considerations relevant to the exercise by the Court of a power to control abuse of its process. It may be that, in an appropriate case, a defect in the process of seeking consent could be relevant to the exercise of such a jurisdiction by a court. However, nothing in the submissions in this Court suggests any defect of a character relevant to abuse in this case. 
     
      
    28    It is not apparent that any issue of “review” of the decision to grant consent arose either “at” or “in reference to” proceedings within the meaning of s5AE(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, in the matter before her Honour, namely the alleged abuse of process. It is not desirable to determine this issue in the absence of any submissions by the parties. 
     
      
    29    The only alleged defect in the consent process raised before Pearlman J, or in this Court, concerned the presence or absence of a prima facie case. Her Honour has rejected the materiality of this allegation by a ruling that has not been challenged and which does not arise on the Stated Case. In these circumstances, question 3(i) is hypothetical and it is undesirable for this Court to answer it in the abstract. 
     
      
       
      Disclosure of Essential Ingredients in the Summons 
       
      
    30    The summons set out the charge as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “… that, on or about 25 February 1998 at Woolloomooloo Bay in the State of New South Wales, it committed an offence against the  
        Environmental Offences and Penalties Act 
         1989 in that it did pollute waters contrary to s16(1) of the  
        Clean Waters Act 
         1970. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Particulars 
           
           
          Pollutants 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          1. Oil; and/or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          2. wastes containing oil; and/or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          3. inflammable liquids 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Waters: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Woolloomooloo Bay.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    31    In this Court two alleged defects in the summons were pressed. First the Defendant submitted that the terminology “on or about 25 February 1998” was insufficiently specific. Secondly, it submitted that the summons failed to set out the actual acts or omissions of the Defendant which were alleged to constitute the alleged offence. Specifically, it was submitted that the charge should have identified the basis for the vicarious liability of the Defendant for the acts of its subcontractor. On either basis, the Defendant submitted, Question 3(ii) should be answered: “Yes”. 
     
      
    32    In her judgment at [53] Pearlman J identified the essential legal ingredients of the offence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) a person 
        
       
       
        
         (b) who polluted 
        
       
       
        
         (c) waters 
        
       
       
        
         (d) at a specified time 
        
       
       
        
         (e) at a specified place 
        
       
       
        
         (f) in contravention of s16(1) 
        
       
       
        
         (g) constituting an offence under the EOP Act.” 
        
       
      
    33    Her Honour concluded that all these essential factual matters appeared in the summons. 
     
      
    34    With respect to the first matter agitated on the appeal, I agree with her Honour. The formulation “on or about 25 February 1998” provides sufficient specificity. It is not necessary to identify a single day. The limited degree of approximation in the frequently employed formulation “on or about” constitutes a degree of specification that satisfies the requirements of pleading and of natural justice, which underlie the relevant principles. 
     
      
    35    The offence with which we are here concerned is not an offence in which time is, of itself, an element of the offence. (See R v Dossi (1918) 13 CrAppR 158 at 159-160; R v VHP (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 7 July 1997, unreported) at 15-16 per Gleeson CJ; R v Stringer [2000] NSWCCA 243 at [19]-[20] per Grove J). 
     
      
    36    With respect to the failure to identify the particular act or omission relied upon, Pearlman J found that this was a matter for particulars, rather than an essential ingredient of the offence. Her Honour said at [56]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although the prosecutor furnished in the summons particulars of the pollutants and the waters, the prosecutor has not particularised the acts or omissions of the defendant which it alleges constitutes the commission of ‘pollute’, and it is clear (which the prosecutor expressly acknowledges) that it must properly furnish further and better particulars to enable the defendant to know the nature of the case it has to meet ( 
        Johnson v Miller 
         (1937) 59 CLR 467).” 
        
       
      
    37    The relevant principles are as stated by Gleeson CJ in Stanton v Abernathy (1990) 19 NSWLR 656 at 666: 
     
      
       
        
        “… an information must identify the essential factual ingredients of the actual offence alleged to have been committed … . The difficulty is that the courts have never managed to produce a technical verbal formula of precise application which constitutes an easy guide, in the circumstances of any given case, as to whether the common law rule has been infringed …” 
        
       
      
    38    The submissions of the Defendant referred to two relevant omissions: the failure to disclose the act or omission of the Defendant which is relied on and also the failure to specify that the Defendant is guilty of the alleged offence on the basis of vicarious liability for the acts or omissions of a subcontractor. At times in its submissions, it appeared that the latter proposition was intended to exhaustively state the basis of the objection. At other times, however, the two ways of putting the proposition appeared to be distinct. I proceed on the basis that the Defendant submitted that each of two omitted matters were essential ingredients of the offence, i.e. both the act or omission said to constitute the act of polluting, on the one hand, and the fact of reliance on vicarious liability on the other hand. 
     
      
    39    It is convenient to deal with the second matter first. The proposition that offences against s16 of the Clean Waters Act may be committed on the basis of vicarious liability is authoritatively established in Tiger Nominees Pty Ltd v State Pollution Control Commission (1992) 25 NSWLR 715 where at 720, Gleeson CJ, after noting that the authority had been applied by the High Court in R v Australasian Films Limited (1921) 29 CLR 195 at 214 quoted and applied the reasoning of Atkin J in Mousell Bros Limited v London and North Western Railway Co [1917] 2 KB 836 at 845, where his Lordship said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I think that the authorities cited by my Lord make it plain that while prima facie a principal is not to be made criminally responsible for the acts of his servants, yet the Legislature may prohibit an act or enforce a duty in such words as to make the prohibition or the duty absolute; in which case the principal is liable if the act is in fact done by his servants. To ascertain whether a particular Act of Parliament has that affect or not regard must be had to the object of a statute, the words used, the nature of the duty laid down, the person upon whom it is imposed, the person by whom it would in ordinary circumstances be performed, and the person upon whom the penalty is imposed.” 
        
       
      
    40    In Tiger Nominees Gleeson CJ went on at 720D to note that: 
     
      
       
        
        “In this passage nothing, in my view, turns upon any distinction between ‘absolute’ liability and ‘strict’ liability.” 
        
       
       
      (See also  
      Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd v Environment Protection  
      Authority (1992) 29 NSWLR 497 at 507;  
      Gatacre v Soil Conservation Service 
        
      of NSW  
      (1992) 78 LGERA 379 at 384-385). 
       
      
    41    Vicarious liability is a direct liability. The acts of the servant or agent are taken to be the acts of the employer, or, in this case, head contractor. (See AIS v EPA supra). The fact that the Defendant is vicariously liable is not an ingredient of the offence at all, let alone an essential ingredient. The Defendant’s submissions in this respect should be rejected. 
     
      
    42    The issue of identification of acts or omissions has recently been considered by this Court in Taylor v Environment Protection Authority [2000] NSWCCA 71. The relevant principles were set out in the judgment of Sperling J with whom Meagher JA and James J agreed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[20] To be valid an information must identify the essential factual ingredients of the offence charged:

        [21] A distinction has been drawn between ‘essential factual ingredients’ (particulars required for the validity of an information) and particulars required merely to ensure that the defendant is able to prepare his or her defence:

        [22] The authorities provide no comprehensive formula for what constitute essential particulars. However, in  
        Johnson v Miller 
         various requirements were identified. These include ‘the time, place and manner of the defendant’s acts or omissions: per Dixon J at 486, citing  
        Smith v Moody 
         at 61, 63. Dixon went on to say (at 489-490): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘In my opinion he (the prosecutor) clearly should be required to identify the transaction on which he relies and he should be so required as soon as it appears that his complaint, in spite of its apparent particularity, is equally capable of referring to a number of occurrences each of which constitutes the offence the legal nature of which is described in the complaint. For a defendant is entitled to be apprised not only of the legal nature of the offence with which he is charged but also of the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge. The court hearing the complaint or information for an offence must have before it a means of identifying with the matter or transaction alleged in the document the matter or transaction appearing in evidence.’

    43    The issue in Taylor v EPA, and in this case, to use the words of Dixon J in Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467, is whether or not there has been sufficient specification of the “manner” of the alleged acts or omissions relied on. 
     
      
    44    In Taylor v EPA the charge was under the then s33(1) of the Pesticides Act 1978 which, relevantly, stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “33(1) …a person shall not in … using …  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a registered pesticide 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        wilfully or carelessly disregard any instruction on any label affixed to a container in which 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) he knows or has reasonable cause to suspect the pesticide to have been, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        if there is a registered label for an approved container for the pesticide that contains that instruction.” 
        
       
      
    45    The relevant text of the summons was: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Prosecutor claims: 
        
       
       
        
        1. An order that the Defendant … appear before a Judge of the Court to answer to the charge that … he committed an offence against section 33(1) of the  
        Pesticides Act 
         1978 (NSW) …not being a person authorised under section 25 of the Act he did, in using a registered pesticide, carelessly disregard an instruction on a label affixed to a container in which he knew or had reasonable cause to suspect the registered pesticide to have been, there being a registered label for an approved container for the pesticide that contained that instruction. 
        
       
       
        
        Particulars 
        
       
       
        
        (a) Registered pesticide: Ficam W Insecticide 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Instruction: ‘Do not allow contact with mattresses, bedclothes or clothing’.” 
        
       
      
    46    Sperling J concluded as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[23] The summons in the present case does not specify the essential ingredients of the alleged offence. It specifies the legal elements of the alleged offence, but it does not specify the  
        acts 
         or  
        omissions 
         by which the appellant is alleged to have carelessly disregarded the instruction on the container. In particular, it does not specify whether the pesticide is alleged to have come into contact with a mattress (or mattresses), bedclothes or clothing, nor does it specify in what  
        manner 
         (that is, by what actual omission) the appellant is alleged to have allowed the pesticide to come into contact with such item or items.” 
        
       
      
    47    In my opinion, some reference to the conduct, apparently of the Defendant’s subcontractor, said to constitute the act of polluting was required in the summons and in the s41 order. 
     
      
    48    Section 16 has been called a “result offence”, in the sense that the consequence, i.e. the pollution, is an essential ingredient of the offence. (Brownlie v State Pollution Control Commission (1992) 27 NSWLR 78 at 83). However as Hunt CJ at CL said in Environment Protection Authority v Bathurst City Council (1995) 89 LGERA 79 at 82, after referring to the classification as a “result offence”: 
     
      
       
        
        “In  
        Brownlie v SPCC, 
         Gleeson CJ said that he was adopting  
        and modifying 
         the classification so that, so far as s16(1) is concerned, the prosecution is required to prove both the conduct of the defendant in placing the material in the waters and the pollution of the waters as a consequence of the defendant having done so.” 
        
       
      
    49    I agree. Both the polluting and the pollution are essential ingredients of the offence under s16. The charge in this case referred only to the pollution. 
     
      
    50    In her reasons for decision Pearlman J referred to the provisions of s43 of the Land and Environment Court Act which enables the Court to cure defects in a summons. Similar considerations arose in this Court in R v Cassell (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 24 July 1996, unreported). In that case Gleeson CJ, with whom Sully and Hulme JJ agreed, identified defects in two of four informations presented in that case.  
     
      
    51    The question posed in the Stated Case before the Court in Cassell was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Did I err in finding the informations were insufficient in law?” 
        
       
      
    52    Gleeson CJ made reference to s65 of the Justices Act 1902, which is the equivalent of s43 of the Land and Environment Court Act. His Honour concluded that the effect of s65 in that case was that the objection taken to the defects should not lead to the conclusion that the informations were insufficient in law and invalid 
     
      
    53    Gleeson CJ interpreted the words “insufficient in law” in the question, to encompass s65 of the Justices Act and, accordingly, answered the questions posed in the affirmative. 
     
      
    54    The question in the present case is framed differently. It focuses, and focuses only, on the omission of an essential ingredient in the words: “Did I err in finding that the summons disclosed properly the essential ingredients of an offence …”. It is not open to this Court to take the course which the Court was able to take in Cassell. The applicability of s43 of the Land and Environment Court Act is a matter for further consideration in that Court. 
     
      
    55    The Question posed should be answered “Yes”. 
     
      
       
      Must a Judge find a prima facie case? 
       
      
    56    Question 4(i) was requested by the Prosecutor. The issue turns on the proper construction of Pt 6 r 2(2) of the Land and Environment Court Rules 1996 in its application to s41 of the Land and Environment Court Act. 
     
      
    57    Part 6 r 2(1) of the Land and Environment Court Rules provide that Div 2 of Pt 75 of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 applies to Class 5 proceedings, with appropriate adaptations. Division 2 of Pt 75 of the Supreme Court Rules is concerned with the Court’s summary jurisdiction. Rule 7 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “7 Proceedings for an offence under any Act which may be taken before the Court in its summary jurisdiction shall be commenced in the Court by summons claiming an order under section 4 of the subject Act in respect of the offence and claiming that the defendant be dealt with according to law for commission of the offence.” 
        
       
       
      The subject Act is the  
      Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction) Act 
       1967. By Pt 6 r 2(1)(d) of the  
      Land and Environment Court Rules 
       a reference to that Act is taken to be a reference to a corresponding provision, if there is a corresponding provision, of Div 5 of Pt 4 of the  
      Land and Environment Court Act, 
       which makes special provision for Class 5 proceedings. The equivalent provision to s4 of the  
      Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction) Act 
       is s41 of the  
      Land and Environment Court Act 
      . 
       
      
    58    Section 41 of the Land and Environment Court Act which is in Div 5 of the Act, provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “41(1) Upon an application being made by any person (in this Division referred to as the  
        prosecutor 
        ) in accordance with the rules, a Judge shall make an order: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) ordering any person alleged in the application to have committed an offence punishable in the Court in its summary jurisdiction to appear at a time and place specified in the order to answer to the offence charged in the order, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) ordering the apprehension of any such person for the purpose of the person’s being brought before a Judge to answer to the offence charged in the order. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) An order under subsection (1) may be made ex parte. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) An order in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed by a person may be made under subsection (1)(b) whether or not an order in respect of that offence has been made out under subsection (1)(a). 
        
       
       
        
        (4) An order under subsection (1)(b): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) shall be addressed to all members of the police force, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) may be addressed to any other person specified in the order, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) may be executed by any member of the police force or by any person to whom it is addressed at any place at which, had the offence specified in the order been committed at that place, that offence would be triable in the Court.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    59    Part 6 r 2(2) of the Land and Environment Court Rules provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “Despite subrule (1) a summons seeking an order pursuant to section 41 of the Act is to be accompanied by the affidavits intended to be relied on by the prosecutor as establishing prima facie proof of the offence charged.” 
        
       
      
    60    Pearlman J referred to the decision of Cripps J in Baker v Macleod (Land and Environment Court, 1 August 1986, unreported). In that case - decided before the introduction of Pt 6 r 2(2) - his Honour had held that there was no requirement upon a prosecutor to furnish an affidavit concerning the nature of the case sought to be made against the defendant, before an order can be made for the issue of a summons under s41 of the Act. His Honour said at p5: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it is no part of a judge’s function to adjudicate upon factual matters which must be established if the prosecution is to succeed.” 
        
       
      
    61    His Honour concluded at p6: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, there is an obligation on the Court before directing the issue of a summons, to satisfy itself that the offence charged is an offence known to the law and within the jurisdiction of the Land and Environment Court and that (if appropriate) the proceedings were duly authorised. It maybe that the Court would also need to satisfy itself of the existence of a condition precedent to the commencing of proceedings as for example, the existence of an order of the Court. The Court would, of course, need to satisfy itself by evidence on oath that it was appropriate to order the apprehension of a person for the purpose of that person being brought before a judge to answer an offence charged. But it is no part of the function of the Court to embark upon an assessment of the quality of the prosecutor’s case. In my opinion, it is undesirable that the Court should be seen to be supervising the performance of prosecutors or to be tendering advice in terms, or by implication, as to the sufficiency of evidentiary material in respect of matters calling for later determination.” 
        
       
      
    62    Pearlman J noted that Pt 6 r 2(2) was introduced into the Rules of Court subsequent to the decision in Baker v Macleod. She indicated that, in her opinion, the rule was enacted at least in part to overcome that decision. Plainly the rule does have an impact on the decision, particularly on the finding of Cripps J at p5: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no requirement, in terms, that a prosecutor must furnish an affidavit setting out the nature of the case sought to be made against the defendant before an order can be made for the issue of a summons. 
        
       
      
    63    The issue before this Court is the extent to which the new rule has impinged on the balance of the reasoning of Cripps J in that case. 
     
      
    64    There are two purposes which may be intended to be served by the obligation to provide the affidavits to a judge exercising jurisdiction under s41 of the Act. The first is to give the judge material which indicates that it is appropriate to exercise the coercive powers for which the section provides. The second purpose is to establish a prima facie case, analogous to the long established tradition of committal proceedings for criminal offences, which serves the important function of ensuring that individuals are not subjected to the rigours of a criminal process without proper cause and that the public resources of a criminal justice system are not needlessly expended. 
     
      
    65    The actual terminology of r 6 2(2) is, in my opinion, more consistent with the narrower than the broader purpose. If a prima facie case was to be established then the rule would more appropriately have been expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “…accompanied by affidavits establishing a prima facie case of the offence charged.” 
        
       
      
    66    The actual rule differs in two respects from a clear statement of this character. First, it introduces words qualifying the nature of the affidavits which must accompany the summons in the terms that such affidavits must be those “intended to be relied on by the prosecutor as …” establishing the relevant facts. Secondly, the traditional formulation of “prima facie case” has not be used and in lieu thereof the rule employs the word “prima facie proof”. 
     
      
    67    The qualification in terms of the intention of the prosecutor directs attention away from any decision making process on the part of the judicial officer. It focuses attention on executive conduct. Furthermore, the use of the word “proof” directs attention to the content of the evidence, rather than to any process of reasoning on the part of the judicial officer.  
     
      
    68    These indications in the text of the rule are supported by the context. 
     
      
    69    The reasoning of Cripps J in Baker v Macleod which highlights the undesirability of the Court becoming involved in reviewing the sufficiency of evidentiary material, or the performance of the prosecutor, is reminiscent of the reasoning of the High Court, particularly in the cases of Barton, Maxwell and  DPP (SA) v B, concerning the undesirability of judicial involvement in the prosecution process, to which I have referred above in relation to question 3(i).  
     
      
    70    As Viscount Dilhorne put it in Director of Public Prosecutions v Humphrys [1977] AC 1 at 26: 
     
      
       
        
        “A judge must keep out of the arena. He should not have or appear to have any responsibility for the institution of a prosecution.” 
        
       
      
    71    It is true that the jurisdiction of the Land and Environment Court contains a unique admixture of judicial functions and the functions of an administrative tribunal. However, this Court should be slow to construe the constituting act of, or rules of, a court in a manner that may give the appearance that the judges of the court perform a function that is closely associated with prosecution process. The independence and impartiality, and particularly the public perception of both independence and impartiality, of the judicial process should not be compromised in any manner with respect to the exercise by a court of a criminal jurisdiction. Clear words are required before the Court will adopt a construction of a court’s acts or rules, which may have any such tendency.  
     
      
    72    Accordingly, in my opinion, the most important part of the context of the rule which falls to be construed in these proceedings is that s41 to which it relates is a power given to a Judge of the Court. By s33(2) of the Act, the Court’s jurisdiction in classes 4, 5, 6 and 7 must be exercised by a Judge. 
     
      
    73    There are two significant points of distinction between an application under s41 and a committal proceeding. Under s41 proceedings are ex parte and the judicial officer does not conduct the preliminary examination for the purpose of a trial in another court. Furthermore, nothing in s41 suggests that only one application for an order can be made. Accordingly if a judge has to assess the affidavit material as to its adequacy on a prima facie case, or some other, test, an appearance may be given that the judge is in some sense supervising the prosecutorial process. In such a context the court should not, unless compelled to do so, construe a rule in the manner for which the defendant contends. 
     
      
    74    The second aspect of the context is that the jurisdiction of the Court under class 5 is a summary jurisdiction. The tradition of preliminary examination in our system of criminal justice is not concerned with summary proceedings, although there have long been provisions which permit a preliminary examination of an indictable charge to be transformed into a summary hearing. Nevertheless, the fact that the relevant jurisdiction is a summary jurisdiction does not support a construction of the relevant rule which requires something in the nature of a preliminary hearing at the point of time when the Court makes an order requiring an appearance before it by the alleged offender.  
     
      
    75    In my opinion question 4(i) should be answered “Yes”. 
     
      
       
      Affidavit Evidence Before Talbot J 
       
      
    76    The Defendant submitted that questions 3(iii), (iv) and (vi) raised the same issues and could be dealt with together. However, it makes no submissions on question 3(iii) and it is not appropriate to answer it. 
     
      
    77    Question 3(iv) poses the question of whether the prosecutor “could rely upon” certain affidavits in support of the application to Talbot J. Question 3(v), which the Defendant dealt with separately, asks whether the affidavits supported a finding that “prima facie proof was established”. 
     
      
    78    The jurisdiction of this Court is limited by s5AE to a “question of law”. (See generally Endicott “Questions of Law” (1998) 114 LQR 292). 
     
      
    79    In Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Limited (1995-1996) 186 CLR 389 at 394, the High Court said in a joint judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        “The distinction between questions of fact and questions of law is a vital distinction in many fields of law. Notwithstanding attempts by many distinguished judges and jurors to formulate tests for finding the line between the two questions, no satisfactory test of universal application has as yet been formulated.” 
        
       
      
    80    In terms, the questions posed in 3(iv) and 3(v) are directed to the admissibility of evidence and whether or not the evidence constitutes “prima facie proof”. The questions are not formulated as questions of law. The Defendant sought to identify a question of law under the rubric of the questions actually posed. Specifically, the submission was made that there was no evidence supporting what was alleged to be an essential matter to be proved, namely vicarious liability of the Defendant for the acts of others. 
     
      
    81    It is not desirable for this Court to reformulate the question actually posed so that it answers the description “question of law”. In any event, by reason of the answer I propose to question 4(i), questions 3(iv) and 3(v) do not need to be addressed. 
     
      
    82    In my opinion each question should be answered “Decline to answer”. 
     
      
    83    Question 3(vi) raises an issue as to validity of service. Part 75 r 9(1) of the Supreme Court Rules is applicable to the proceedings in the Land and Environment Court. That rule provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “9(1) The summons and any affidavit in support of an application under section 4 of the subject Act shall not, unless the court so directs, be served before the making of the order but shall be served on the defendant when the minute or order is served on him.” 
        
       
      
    84    Section 68 of the Land and Environment Court Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “68(1) In any proceedings before the Court, the Court shall have power at any stage of the proceeding to order, upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as the Court thinks fit, any amendments to be made which, in the opinion of the Court, are necessary in the interests of justice. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Where, in beginning or purporting to begin any proceedings before the Court or at any stage in the course of or in connection with any such proceedings, there is, by reason of anything done or left undone, a failure to comply with the requirements of this Act or of the rules whether in respect of time, place, manner, form or content or in any other respect: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the failure shall be treated as an irregularity and shall not nullify the proceedings, or any step taken in the proceedings, or any document, judgment or order in the proceedings, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) subject to subsection (3), the Court may, on terms, set aside wholly or in part the proceedings or any step taken in the proceedings or any document, judgment or order in the proceedings or exercise its functions under this Act and the rules to allow amendments and to make orders dealing with the proceedings generally. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) The Court shall not set aside any proceedings before it or any step taken in any such proceedings or any document, judgment or order in any such proceedings on the ground of a failure to which subsection (2) applies on the application of any party unless the application is made within a reasonable time and before the applicant has taken any fresh step after becoming aware of the irregularity.” 
        
       
      
    85    In her judgment Pearlman J referred to the rule and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[63] That rule was not complied with by the prosecutor. The order and summons was served first, but unaccompanied by any affidavits. Three affidavits were served 15 days later, but none of those affidavits had been relied upon by the prosecutor in obtaining the order under s41. Two of the affidavits upon which the prosecutor so relied were served 23 days after the summons and order was served, and the third of such affidavits was served a further 21 days later. 
        
       
       
        
        [64] Such a failure is not commendable and is hardly excusable on the part of an experienced statutory authority, but it does not nullify the proceedings. It is a proper case for the application of s68(2) of the Court Act, which provides, relevantly, that where there is, by reason of anything done, a failure to comply with the requirements of the Court Act or of the LEC Rules, the failure shall be treated as an irregularity and shall not nullify the proceedings. The defendant has not been required to plead, and all the relevant affidavits have now been served. There is, accordingly, no justification for proceeding otherwise than in accordance with s68(2).” 
        
       
      
    86    Question 3(vi) in the Stated Case refers to non-compliance with both Pt 75 r 8 and Pt 75 r 9. Rule 8 requires the filing of both the summons and order together. Her Honour did not consider Pt 75 r 8 in her judgment. Indeed, her finding of fact in [63] to the effect that “the order and summons were served first but unaccompanied by any affidavits” suggests that r 8 was in fact complied with. No submissions were made with respect to Pt 75 r 8 and it is not clear why it has been included in the question. Even if it were otherwise appropriate to do so, that part of question 3(vi) referring to Pt 75 r 8 should not be answered. 
     
      
    87    In the submissions to this Court the Prosecutor relied on the proposition that Pt 75 r 9 was not engaged because the affidavits required to accompany the summons pursuant to Pt 6 r 2(2) of the Land and Environment Court Rules are not “affidavits in support of an application”, within Pt 75 r 9 of the Supreme Court Rules as applicable to the Land and Environment Court. This submission does not arise on the question in the Stated Case and this Court should not deal with it. 
     
      
    88    With respect to Pt 75 r 9, the “question of law” proposed to be raised by question 3(vi) does not clearly appear either on the face of the question or in the submissions.  
     
      
    89    The submissions in this Court on behalf of the Defendant were to the effect that “the conduct of the prosecution was such as to mean its failure to comply with the rules put it ‘out of Court’. Its failure should not be excused so as to require the Defendant to be exposed to a criminal penalty” and “… the failure is fundamental and goes to the root of the prosecution. Had the prosecution been compelled to comply with the rules, it is clear that the proceedings could not have been commenced within time. The statutory limitation period was not able to be enlarged. The defendant is therefore exposed to a penalty if the section is applied. This is unconscionable”. 
     
      
    90    I find it difficult to identify any question of law in these conclusory assertions. No submission was made as to why or how the words of s68(2) should be read down in any relevant manner. The reference to a standard of “unconscionability” and the invocation of the statutory limitation period is not made to appear material to the operation of s68(2)(a), which operates of its own force. The power conferred on the Court by s68(2)(b) was not engaged in the present proceedings. No issue arose with respect to the exercise by the Court of any discretion. 
     
      
    91    In the absence of any submission to the effect that the failure to serve the affidavits at the same time as the minute of order pursuant to Pt 75 r 9(1) was anything other than “a failure to comply with the requirement of ... the rules …”, no reason was advanced why s68(2)(a) should not apply as her Honour found.  
     
      
    92    Accordingly I would answer Question 3(vi): “No with respect to Part 75 rule 9. Otherwise, decline to answer”. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    93    The Court should answer the questions as follows: 
     
      
       
      3(i) Decline to Answer. 
       
       
      3(ii) Yes. 
       
       
      3(iii) Decline to Answer. 
       
       
      3(iv) Decline to Answer. 
       
       
      3(v) Decline to Answer. 
       
       
      3(vi) No with respect to Part 75 rule 9. Otherwise, decline to Answer. 
       
       
      4(i) Yes. 
       
      
    94    GROVE J: I agree with Spigelman CJ. 
     
      
    95    KIRBY J: I agree with the Chief Justice.

     REGINA v Timothy Paul GUIDER 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1    FITZGERALD JA: The circumstances giving rise to this appeal against conviction and application for leave to appeal against sentence are set out in the reasons for judgment of Newman J. I agree with his Honour’s reasons for judgment and with the orders which his Honour proposes. 
     
      
      I propose to add only brief comments. 
       
      
    2    As Newman J has stated, the appellant attacked the competence of the legal practitioners who represented him at his trial. The copy of his trial solicitor’s notes which the appellant placed before the Court contained inappropriate flippant comments concerning evidence, especially evidence given by the appellant. While the appellant’s solicitor’s scepticism is understandable, the notes indicate an unacceptable unprofessional approach. 
     
      
    3    Further, although the appellant waived privilege and his trial only occurred last year, neither the barrister nor the solicitor who represented him at his trial made any effort to explain their conduct of the appellant’s defence or their omission to provide an explanation of their conduct at the trial. Their failure to do so is also unsatisfactory. They should at least have explained the reasons for the course which was taken in relation to Mr Redibaum’s evidence. 
     
      
    4    The trial effectively involved a contest between Mr Redibaum’s evidence implicating the appellant and the appellant’s evidence implicating Mr Redibaum. A decision not to challenge the reliability of Mr Redibaum’s evidence on the basis of his criminal history cannot be criticised if, as I think, it was legitimate to seek to ensure that the jury did not receive evidence of the appellant’s prior criminal history. The decision not to lead evidence of the appellant’s prior criminal history is readily explicable and, without the advantage of hindsight, could not possibly be criticised. That being so, the decision not to adduce expert evidence concerning the consequences of Mr Redibaum’s brain injury was understandable. The expert evidence would have revealed Mr Redibaum’s criminal activities in the course of explaining his dishonesty was a consequence of his brain injury.  
     
      
    5    However, it was theoretically possible to cross-examine Mr Redibaum to establish, without reference to any suggestion that he had committed offences, that, since his brain injury and as a consequence of it, he had a tendency to lie. If that could have been established, it would have provided the basis for a submission that his evidence was the evidence of an acknowledged liar, which the jury should not accept. Nonetheless, that course would have involved a considerable risk that the prosecution would become entitled to prove the appellant’s prior criminal history, and cannot be stigmatised as incompetent. 
     
      
    6    More broadly, I can perceive no basis which would justify a conclusion that there has been any miscarriage of justice. There was a very strong prosecution case against the appellant. If the prosecution had been able to prove the appellant’s criminal record as a result of his lawyers’ conduct of the trial, the case against him would have been overwhelming. 
     
      
       
      
    7    NEWMAN J: Timothy Paul Guider appeals against his conviction on two charges and seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed following his conviction. 
     
      
    8    The appellant was indicted on two counts before Armitage DCJ. Count one charged that between 10 November 1997 and 19 November 1997 at Sydney he conspired with one, Filipe Tongilava Uhila to commit a robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. 
     
      
    9    The second count was that on 18 November 1997 he was armed with a weapon namely an imitation pistol with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. 
     
      
    10    The first count which is a common law offence has a discretionary maximum penalty but it is appropriate in conspiracy cases for a sentencing judge to take into account the penalty prescribed by the Crimes Act for the substantive offence, in this case robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. 
     
      
    11    The second count carried a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. 
     
      
    12    In the event, the appellant was convicted on 28 May 1999 by a jury on each count. His Honour in relation to the first count imposed a head sentence of ten years consisting of a minimum term of seven years six months and an additional term of two years six months. 
     
      
    13    In relation to the second count he imposed a concurrent fixed term of three years. 
     
      
    14    The Crown case was as follows. 
     
      
    15    The appellant and one, Solomon Redibaum had first met some twenty years prior to 11 November 1997 in Western Australia. Redibaum knew the appellant well. On 11 November 1997 Redibaum had a chance meeting with the appellant. There the appellant told Redibaum that he was planning a robbery and invited him to join with him in that enterprise. The appellant and Redibaum drove to Primrose park. En route the appellant talked about his work as a mural artist. The conversation moved on to personal finance and the appellant indicated he was seeking credit. Redibaum suggested that he may be able to arrange a loan to the appellant through his uncle. He said that he would try to raise $25,000 of which $5,000 he would retain. 
     
      
    16    At Primrose Park Redibaum was introduced to Filipe Tongilava Uhila who arrived in an RAV4 motor vehicle. Redibaum witnessed the appellant and Uhila transfer various items, including a pistol, from Redibaum’s vehicle to the RAV4 vehicle. The three men drove to the city where Redibaum was dropped off. Before parting company the appellant gave Redibaum his mobile telephone number and invited him to call him. 
     
      
    17    Redibaum contacted police and subsequently met with Det Dowding and Det Kerr-Thompson. Redibaum was registered as an informer. After that meeting Redibaum telephoned the appellant and arranged to meet him at Dee Why. The appellant drove Redibaum to his house in Collaroy. That night the two men discussed the robbery which the appellant estimated would raise a sum of between $200,000 or $300,000. He also indicated that he had a gun for use in the robbery. 
     
      
    18    Early on the morning of 13 November 1997 they drove in the appellant’s four wheel drive motor vehicle to Warriewood Square where they observed the opening procedures at the Commonwealth Bank and St George Bank. The appellant described the opening procedures to Redibaum. The appellant said that he and Uhila would enter the Commonwealth Bank with the second group of staff. Once inside they planned to tie up the staff and empty the safe. In the case of the St George Bank the appellant planned the same strategy except he and Uhila would enter with the last of the employees. The appellant said that Redibaum would be required to remain outside and observe the car park and listen to the police scanners. Redibaum gave the appellant money for the purpose of renting a vehicle for possible use in the enterprise. The appellant mentioned that he had a pair of numberplates. After parting company Redibaum met with police at the Dee Why RSL club. At some point the appellant showed Redibaum a pair of two way portable radios and a police scanner. He then instructed Redibaum how to use them. 
     
      
    19    On Sunday 16 November 1997 Redibaum accompanied the appellant to a toy shop at Warriewood Square. The appellant shoplifted a toy pistol that was grey/blue in colour and similar in design to a small version of a Berretta pistol. They then went to K-Mart where the appellant shoplifted a lock worth approximately$90. Redibaum returned the lock to the shop and exchanged it for cigarettes. 
     
      
    20    On 17 November 1997 the appellant indicted to Redibaum that he planned to commit the robbery that day. Redibaum went with the appellant to Warriewood. In the car park of Franklins the appellant gave Redibaum a two way portable radio and the two men communicated on the radios to ensure they were in working order. At the car park Redibaum was able to call police on his mobile phone and communicate with them using a pre determined message. The men then went to Warriewood Square. The appellant informed Redibaum that it was the St George Bank that was to be targeted. After the appellant had left the vehicle two female police officers arrived on the scene. Redibaum advised the appellant of this on the portable radios and the plan was aborted. Snr Const Bolton gave evidence that she was at Warriewood Square on 17 November 1997 at about 8.15 am in the company of Const Berry. In the car park she saw a maroon coloured RAV4 motor vehicle index number THS 834. Driving on the main road she saw a four wheel drive vehicle number ULN 650. 
     
      
    21    Redibaum and the appellant then drove to the city and parked the RAV4 vehicle. En route they picked up Uhila and Redibaum purchased a balaclava at Kelly’s Disposal store. The three men observed the security arrangements at the Westpac Bank on Castlereagh Street opposite the Imperial Arcade. The appellant explained that he and Uhila would rob the bank, escape through the Imperial Arcade and make a getaway from Pitt Street. Redibaum was instructed to observe the security guards and watch out for police. Acting on the appellant’s instructions Redibaum walked into the bank appraised it and reported his observations to the appellant. He then left the scene and returned to the RAV4 vehicle. He telephoned police. The appellant and Uhila returned to the RAV4 vehicle fifteen minutes later and announced they had not committed the robbery. The appellant stated that they would go to Warriewood Square the next day and carry out the plan. Later that day Redibaum met with police to discuss the robbery planned for the next day. Subsequently he telephoned the appellant to advise that he would supply a vehicle for the following day. 
     
      
    22    The following morning, 18 November 1997, Snr Sgt Sturchow fitted Redibaum with a listening device and Snr Const Kerr-Thompson supplied him with a Commodore motor vehicle with South Australian registration number VWZ 399. Redibaum telephoned the appellant using Kerr-Thompson’s mobile telephone. Later in the morning Redibaum met with the appellant and witnessed him unload items from his car into the Commodore. They drove to Dee why and met with Uhila. From Dee Why the three men drove to Warriewood. On two occasions they stopped the vehicle. At the first stop the appellant changed the registration plates. He also handed Redibaum a police scanner that he tuned into police radio bands. On the second occasion they stopped at a service station at North Narrabeen where Redibaum purchased a pair of sunglasses for Uhila. 
     
      
    23    Redibaum waited in the car park opposite St George Bank while the appellant and Uhila exited the car. Redibaum and the appellant tested the two way portable radios. The appellant and Uhila were apprehended by police. Snr Const McFadyen gave evidence of their apprehension. McFadyen witnessed the appellant being searched and observed the following items on the appellant’s person, an imitation pistol, a police scanner, a two way radio connected to an earpiece in his ear and a knife. Snr Const Brody searched Uhila and seized from his person items including an imitation firearm, a semi automatic pistol, sunglasses and a hat. A black bag was also seized. The bag contained, two caps (one with the word “police” on it) two pairs of rubber gloves, three lengths of rope and one opened packet of rubbish bags. Snr Const slot gave sworn evidence that he searched a white Commodore motor vehicle and seized items including a screwdriver, four small screws and a two way radio. Acting Det Inspector Dowding arrested the appellant and Uhila. The appellant was taken to Dee Why police station where he spoke with a solicitor. He declined to participate in a recorded interview. 
     
      
    24    In reply to the Crown case the appellant gave sworn evidence that he, in fact, met Redibaum on 11 November 1997. His evidence in chief represented an almost total reversal of Redibaum’s account. 
     
      
    25    He said that Redibaum offered to arrange a $25,000 interest free loan through his uncle of which $5,000 would go to Redibaum as a form of commission. The appellant recounted that Redibaum went onto suggest that there were banks at Warriewood that were vulnerable to robbery and he invited the appellant and his friend Uhila to observe the banks. The appellant declined the invitation. When they parted company the appellant gave him his mobile telephone number and said he would contact Redibaum. The appellant said he met with Redibaum later that day and they went to the appellant’s house. 
     
      
    26    On 12 November 1997 Redibaum spent the night at the appellant’s house. Redibaum again requested that the appellant and Uhila accompany him in the morning to observe the banks he had referred to previously. The appellant agreed and contacted Uhila. The three men observed the banks the following morning and Redibaum again asked the appellant to consider his suggestion about the banks. Redibaum gave the appellant $70 before they parted company. Redibaum stayed the night at the appellant’s house and again mentioned the banks. 
     
      
    27    The next day, 13 November 1997 the appellant contacted Redibaum by phone on a number of occasions and they met. Their discussions centred on the loan Redibaum had offered to arrange. 
     
      
    28    The appellant next met Redibaum on Saturday, 15 November 1997. At Redibaum’s request the appellant allowed a number of items to be put in his car. The items included black plastic bags, black balaclava and an imitation firearm. 
     
      
    29    On Sunday, 16 November 1997 the appellant discussed the proposal to rob the bank with Redibaum and described it as ridiculous. The appellant did not want to upset Redibaum as he feared he would withdraw his offer to arrange the loan. The two men went to a toy shop to buy a birthday present for the appellant’s son. In the shop Redibaum shoplifted a toy gun. They then went to K-Mark where Redibaum shoplifted a lock and then returned it to the shop where it was exchanged for a carton of cigarettes. At some point on the weekend Redibaum suggested they organise Uhila and go to the banks for a dress rehearsal. The appellant was to bring the items previously given to him and a pair of portable two way radios which the appellant used at work. They also discussed the loan on the weekend. 
     
      
    30    On Monday, 17 November 1997 the appellant went to Redibaum’s flat where he saw a scanner, number plates and hats which were in plastic bags. They went to collect Uhila in the appellant’s motor vehicle but he was not there. They then drove to Warriewood. They stopped in the car park of Franklins at Mona Vale where the appellant put various items in plastic bags and demonstrated how the two way radios operated. The appellant left the car with the bag containing balaclavas and imitation pistols. He met Uhila who was already at the shopping centre. The appellant saw two police officers and after going to the bakery he returned to the vehicle. The appellant said that he only went with Redibaum to humour him and harboured no intention of going through with the robbery. 
     
      
    31    The three men left Warriewood and travelled to the city for a purpose related to the appellant’s work as an artist. They stopped on their way and Redibaum purchased a balaclava. The appellant said the he told off Redibaum. Redibaum pressed on with his idea and suggested they carry out a robbery the next day. In the city Redibaum parted company with the appellant and Uhila. The appellant discussed the situation with Uhila and decided he would pretend to go along with robbery in the morning. In failing to execute the planned robbery the appellant had hoped that Redibaum would leave him alone. 
     
      
    32    On Tuesday, 18 November 1997 the appellant went along with Redibaum in the preparation of the planned robbery. He said that his commitment to the enterprise was pretence. He went along with the charade only because he was interested in obtaining the loan through Redibaum. About forty feet from St George Bank the appellant and Uhila were seated reading newspapers. The appellant said he was about to return to Redibaum in the car when they were arrested. The appellant denied that he was the mastermind behind the planned robbery and that he had recruited Redibaum as a participant. 
     
      
    33    When the trial commenced the appellant was unrepresented. At the appellant’s request a voir dire examination was carried out. The voir dire was directed at the evidence Redibaum was to give in the Crown case. The appellant challenged Redibaum’s evidence on two bases. 
     
      
    34    First, that the evidence of the conversation between Redibaum and the appellant of 18 November 1997 recorded on a listening device should be excluded on the basis that it was obtained illegally and improperly pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act (NSW) 1995. No challenge is made in this appeal to his Honour’s ruling that the evidence was properly obtained. 
     
      
    35    The second basis was that Redibaum’s evidence should not in its entirety be led in the Crown case because his evidence would be inherently unbelievable. 
     
      
    36    In relation to both of the challenges made to Redibaum’s evidence, the appellant relied upon psychiatric and neurological evidence. That evidence consisted of reports from two psychiatrists, Drs Wong and Reid and a neurologist Dr Leicester. It is the second matter which is the subject of challenge in this appeal. 
     
      
    37    The reports tendered before his Honour revealed that Redibaum, in February 1969 had suffered brain damage when a motor cycle he was riding collided with a tree at which time Redibaum was not wearing a helmet. Dr Leicester, who had seen him at the time, diagnosed Redibaum as suffering from traumatic brain damage with compound left frontal skull fracture, post-traumatic epilepsy, blind left eye, anosmia and frontal lobe personality change. 
     
      
    38    Not before his Honour in the report from Dr Leicester which he had before him, was an observation made in a statutory declaration by that doctor dated 22 June 2000 in which he stated that while he had not previously commented on prognosis he knew that the features I have set out above might be permanent in which case Redibaum, though capable of remembering and reporting, might be unreliable. 
     
      
    39    The psychiatric reports tendered did not suggest that Redibaum might be an unreliable witness but indicated that his brain damage had left him in a situation where he would commit offences of dishonesty on impulse. Indeed, Dr Reid observed as follows in a report dated 20 July 1972: 
     
      
       
        
        “The surprising thing is that this young man although he shows marked signs of grossly anti-social behaviour, also has a very considerable amount of insight and intellectual honesty, as he has no illusions about himself and indeed in some ways he is almost over-critical of his own conduct, as he is obviously guilty and has pangs of conscience about quite a number of things. One thing which surprised me about him, was the honesty with which he almost rejected the idea that his head injury could be relevant to his crime.” 
        
       
      
    40    In a later reported dated 22 September 1980 Dr Reid again refers to the honesty of the approach taken by Redibaum. 
     
      
    41    Dr Wong in his reports makes no reference to Redibaum being unreliable. 
     
      
    42    In the event his Honour heard evidence from Redibaum and the police involved in the matter. Contrary to a submission made by the appellant to this Court, a close and careful reading of Redibaum’s evidence on the voir dire demonstrates that he did not resile from his evidence as to the events as set out above, despite a very exhaustive and lengthy cross examination carried out by the appellant. 
     
      
    43    The same may be said about the evidence given by police on the voir dire. His Honour rejected the appellant’s contention that Redibaum’s evidence should be excluded on either basis. However, his Honour concluded his judgment on the voir dire by stating: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Redibaum’s mental state is also a matter that may be further investigated at the trial.” 
        
       
      
    44    It should be observed that R v Farrell [1998] 194 CLR 286 confirms the common law that expert evidence may be called where that evidence is directed to the existence of a disability the consequences of which might bear on the reliability of a witness’s evidence. 
     
      
    45    It follows that his Honour correctly left the question of such a challenge to Redibaum’s credibility open at the trial. No error can be demonstrated in the reasons given by his Honour for allowing Redibaum’s evidence to be led. He considered with care, both the lay and medical material before him. 
     
      
    46    When the trial commenced the appellant was represented by a solicitor and counsel. No cross-examination was directed by counsel to Redibaum concerning his brain damage and consequent psychiatric problems. 
     
      
    47    In written instructions dated 14 May 1999 given to his legal advisers the appellant stated that “in regard to Drs Wong etc I note there is an issue of relevance and reports will have to be read by my advisers”. 
     
      
    48    Accordingly, there is no doubt that the question of Redibaum’s mental state was brought to the attention of those appearing for the appellant. Indeed, in a somewhat circumscribed affidavit the then counsel for the appellant stated that “my only recollection at present is that I did consider the issue of Mr Redibaum’s mental state and associated psychiatric reports in the context of Mr Guider’s trial.” 
     
      
    49    Not only was no cross-examination directed but also and no doubt as a consequence of the absence of cross-examination, the psychiatric and neurological evidence contained in the reports to which I have referred, was not put before the jury. 
     
      
    50    I turn then to the grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground One: the evidence of the main witness, on whom the Crown case relied, a Mr Solomon Redibaum, was unreliable for psychiatric reasons. 
       
      
    51    I have already dealt with his Honour’s ruling on this question above. As I have said no error is detected in the ruling his Honour made therefore this ground must fail. 
     
      
       
      Ground two: due to gross negligence or incompetence on the part of my former legal representatives they refused (against my wishes) to raise Mr Redibaum’s mental state before the jury. 
       
      
    52    I should add that in addition to the question of Redibaum’s mental state the appellant also complained under this head, that his legal advisers failed, as he wished them to, to lead evidence of the appellant’s prior criminal history which includes numerous convictions for armed robbery. 
     
      
    53    In this regard the appellant contended that he wished to have it submitted to the jury that an experienced armed robber like himself, would be unlikely to undertake such an amateurish attempt to rob a bank as was the case here. Particularly as the bank was one he used and in the area in which he lived. 
     
      
    54    I shall return to this additional point later in these reasons. 
     
      
    55    While the affidavit of the appellant’s trial counsel does not give the reason why, having considered the question of Redibaum’s mental state, he did not raise it as an issue going to Redibaum’s reliability, there is no doubt that his decision not to do so was a considered one. 
     
      
    56    The question therefore arises is whether his decision not to do so falls within the concept of incompetence of counsel being such as to give rise to a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    57    This question has been considered over the last decade in a number of case before this Court. In R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 685 per Gleeson CJ: 
     
      
       
        
        “A Court of Criminal Appeal has a power and a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what amounts to a miscarriage of justice is something that has to be considered in the light of the way in which the system of criminal justice operates. 
        
       
       
        
        As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence. 
        
       
       
        
        However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of ‘flagrant incompetence’ of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.” 
        
       
      
    58    Subsequently in R v Ignjatic (1993) 68 A Crim R 333 at 338, Hunt CJ at CL made it clear that it is for the appellant to persuade the court that a miscarriage of justice has occurred and it is for the appellant to provide the evidence upon which such a conclusion could fairly be based. His Honour went on to state at 338: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not sufficient that the appellant may have merely lost a chance to raise various issues which were not raised at the trial. There was no miscarriage of justice unless it can be shown that there was at least a substantial chance that the appellant would have succeeded in relation to those issues”. 
        
       
      
    59    The decision not to cross-examine Mr Redibaum about his mental state plainly was a tactical decision taken by the appellant’s counsel. Hunt CJ at CL in Ignjatic said at 336: 
     
      
       
        
        “Counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted. Decisions as to which witnesses should or should not be called, what questions should or should not be asked, which lines of argument should be pursued, which points should be abandoned and which of two or more inconsistent defences should be raised are all matters within the discretion of counsel, and they frequently involve difficult problems of judgment, including judgment as to the best tactics to be adopted. Neither disobedience of instructions nor even incompetence is sufficient of itself to attract appellate intervention. It is only when the error made was of such a nature in the circumstances of the case as to have led to a miscarriage of justice that this Court will interfere”. 
        
       
      
    60    In the light of the factual issue raised by the appellant at his trial, namely that he did not intend to take part in the armed robbery but went as far as he did merely to humour Redibaum in order that Redibaum would continue his efforts to obtain a loan for the appellant, the tactical decision not to raise Redibaum’s mental state as an issue is readily explicable. 
     
      
    61    Particularly as the transcript of what was recorded by the listening device of the conversation between Redibaum and the appellant shortly before his arrest is indicative of the leading role played by the appellant in the planning of the proposed robbery further explains why counsel would not challenge the reliability of Redibaum in the manner suggested by the appellant. 
     
      
    62    In these circumstances the conduct of counsel does not fall within the principles adumbrated in Birks and Ignjatic and thus no miscarriage of justice has occurred. 
     
      
    63    Again, the decision of counsel not to raise the appellant’s criminal record is also explainable in tactical terms. The appellant was arrested in circumstances where he had been recorded on a listening device as taking a very active part in the planning of the proposed robbery and in circumstances where at the time of his arrest paraphernalia (false pistol, balaclava etc) which are normally associated with a bank robbery, were found in his close proximity. 
     
      
    64    To deliberately raise his prior extensive record as an armed robber might well be considered by competent counsel as being absolutely fatal to the issue raised by the appellant, namely while present he had no intention of taking part in the proposed robbery. 
     
      
    65    Once more the tactical decision not to lead evidence of the appellant’s past record does not offend the principles set out in Birks and Ignjatic and this point must also fail. Accordingly the second ground must also be dismissed. 
     
      
    66    I should add that included in the appellant’s submission was a contention that the evidence of Drs Wong, Reid and Leicester constituted fresh evidence which should have been put before this Court by way of vive voce evidence in support of the appeal. 
     
      
    67    The evidence was certainly not fresh. Indeed it was referred to in the voir dire examination. The fact that Dr Leicester now says that the brain damage might make Redibaum’s evidence unreliable again does not fall within the concept of fresh evidence as such evidence was available at the hearing. 
     
      
    68    It was also contended by the appellant in his submissions in relation to the voir dire examination that because at that stage legal aid had not been granted, the principle in cases such as R v Zorad 1990 NSWLR 91 was breached by his Honour by not giving the appellant proper guidance. To the contrary the transcript of the voir dire examination reveals that his Honour did in fact proffer adequate guiance. 
     
      
    69    Indeed, he left it open to the appellant or his representative to raise the question of the reliability of Redibaum’s evidence in the trial proper. In these circumstances this latter contention must also fail. Accordingly I am of the view that the appellant’s appeal against conviction must be dismissed. 
     
      
    70    I turn then to the question of sentence. There is no doubt that a ten year head sentence for a conspiracy to commit armed robbery represents stern retribution. I have indicated above that the appellant, in fact, has a significant criminal history. 
     
      
    71    The appellant was first convicted and sentenced for armed robbery in 1976. He was convicted of like offences in 1981 and 1986. In fact at the time of the commission of the offence at the age of forty-four he had been convicted of no less than sixteen robbery offences, eight of which were offences of armed robbery. 
     
      
    72    In R v Cann, unreported Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 October 1994, this Court held as I have indicated above, that while this is a common law offence having no prescribed maximum penalty, it is appropriate in assessing penalty for the common law offence to bear in mind the penalties prescribed for armed robbery with an offensive weapon, namely twenty years imprisonment. 
     
      
    73    The planning for the proposed robbery was considerable as is evidenced by the paraphernalia found by police at the time of arrest. While his Honour, in his remarks on sentence, pointed out that it was in the appellant’s favour that the weapon in question was an imitation pistol which was not capable of killing or inflicting serious injury. Had the proposed robbery taken place it would have involved the terrorising of those in the bank who would not know that the pistol was an imitation one. Bank robberies are rightly considered by the criminal law as standing high in the criminal calendar. 
     
      
    74    In this case the fact that the proposed robbery was to be carried out in company was an aggravating feature. The appellant’s past criminal history placed him in a situation where he could hardly expect to be given lenient treatment by the courts for criminal conduct of this type. 
     
      
    75    There is nothing in the evidence before his Honour which suggests that there were any special circumstances which would require any variation of the proportion between the minimum and additional terms as set out in the Sentencing Act as it then applied. His Honour in his remarks made such an observation. 
     
      
    76    The appellant complained largely on an anecdotal basis that others convicted of similar crimes have received lesser sentences than himself. However, in the light of the nature of the offence and his past criminal record I find that his Honour committed no error in applying the relevant sentencing principles when imposing the subject sentence. 
     
      
    77    Because of the importance of the matter to the appellant I would grant him leave to appeal but would proposed that the appeal against sentence be dismissed. 
     
      
    78    In short, the orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted but appeal against sentence dismissed.

      KIRBY, J. 
     THURSDAY 14 SEPTEMBER 2000 
     
     REGINA v. FRANK INGENHOFF 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   PRIESTLEY, JA: I will ask Greg James, J. to give the reasons of the court. We have had a brief opportunity of consulting and we are agreed there should be a new trial. 
    2   GREG JAMES, J: This is an appeal brought from a conviction on one count of malicious wounding. The appellant was tried jointly with Rodney David Hollier. The latter appealed to this court from his conviction on that count. That appeal was the subject of a judgment of this court on 15 June 2000: Regina v. Hollier [2000] NSWCCA 225. The circumstances of the trial and how it came about that the applicant and his co-accused were so convicted are set forth in that judgment. The court concluded that the conviction should be overturned as inconsistent and unable to stand in consequence of the acquittal of both accused on a charge of possession of a firearm. The malicious wounding was said to have been occasioned by the use of that firearm. 
    3   There being no way that a rational explanation could afford a basis for the different verdicts to stand together perceivable by the court, it was necessary to allow the appeal. Similarly, it is necessary to allow the present appeal. 
    4   The question arose in Hollier (supra) as to what course the court should take. In that case in the judgment I delivered, with which the Chief Justice and Newman, J. agreed, I said:- 
     
      
       
       ""The question then arises as to what course this court should take. I have not concluded that there is such legal inconsistency between the verdicts as was referred to in  
       Mackenzie 
        (supra) and as would show an inconsistent record in this court. It may be that at a new trial questions of substantial difficulty might arise as to what evidence might be admitted and what direction might be given to the jury to avoid the canvassing of the acquittal and in that regard it may be that attention will have to be given to the principles referred to in the High Court's decisions in  
       Garrett v. The Queen  
       (1978) 139 CLR 437;  
       Storey v. The Queen 
        (1978) 140 CLR 364 and  
       Rogers v. The Queen 
        (1994) 181 CLR 251. 
       
      
      
       
       However, it does not seem to me that the fact that a new trial might present complex or difficult questions is a matter which should, in the light of a verdict which, to an extent, when considered on its own, is explicable, be such as to stand in the way of an exercise of discretion in favour of the Director. It may be that having regard to these matters and having regard to the complex questions of presentation such a trial might involve, the Director might consider his position but that is purely a matter for him as the order made by this court in respect of a new trial is not mandatory but facultative."" 
       
      
    5   On the present appeal coming forward for hearing, the Crown conceded that since Mr. Ingenhoff was, at trial, alleged to be the person who had the gun, this case so sufficiently shared the circumstances exposed in the judgment to which I have referred, that the appeal had to succeed. Mr. Norrish, QC., who appears for the appellant, has, however, submitted that the ultimate result should be different in that, in his submission, the court should not make the order for a new trial that was made in Hollier (supra). He draws our attention to s.8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which is as following:-  
     
      
       
       ""On an appeal against a conviction on indictment, the court may, either of its own motion, or on the application of the appellant, order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit, if the court considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and, that having regard to all the circumstances, such miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by any other order which the court is empowered to make."" 
       
      
    6   The order for a new trial in this court is an order that, by reason of that section, may be made in the discretion of the court having regard to all the circumstances, if the court finds that the miscarriage detected, occasioning the success of the appeal, is such as more adequately can be remedied by the taking of that course. It is an order which permits the Crown the possibility of a new trial, it does not require it, and it would permit the Crown here that possibility in circumstances where it cannot be said that the effect of the acquittals is such that no appropriate charge can be brought. In my judgment in Hollier (supra) I had concluded that it might be available to the Crown, consistent with those principles referred to by the High Court in the cases I have cited such as Garrett v. The Queen (1978) 139 CLR 437; Storey v. The Queen (1978) 140 CLR 364 and Rogers v. The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 251, to bring some case and if it was, the Crown should not be precluded from seeking to do so by the order of this court. I see no basis to distinguish the circumstances of Mr. Ingenhoff's appeal from those to which I referred in Mr. Hollier's appeal. 
    7   In my view there should be the option available to the Crown of a new trial of which it might avail itself if it can come within the appropriate principles. 
    8   I would propose that the appeal be upheld and that there be a new trial. 
    9   PRIESTLEY, JA: I agree. 
    10   KIRBY, J: I also agree. 
    11   PRIESTLEY, JA: The orders of the court, therefore, are appeal upheld, conviction set aside and a new trial ordered.

     REGINA v Jon Leslie BAARTMAN 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Kirby J.2   KIRBY J: Jon Leslie Baartman (the appellant) was charged with the murder of Leszic Henryck Betcher at Lugarno on 23 February 1993. Others were charged with the same murder. An order was made for separate trials. The trial of Mr Baartman took place before Dunford J and a jury, it being a retrial. The appellant was convicted on 2 November 1998. He appeals against that conviction. 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    3   On 23 February 1993, Mrs Betcher was at home at Lugarno with her husband (the deceased). She heard footsteps on the driveway. Her husband went to the door, which was open. There was a wire screen door which was locked. Mrs Betcher heard a male voice say loudly: “I want to speak to Tony.” The deceased responded by saying that no-one by that name lived at that address. Mrs Betcher then heard a gunshot. She went to the aid of her husband. He had collapsed, and died shortly after. 
     
      
    4   Neighbours of Mr and Mrs Betcher heard the shot. They witnessed a vehicle leaving the suburban street at high speed. Some had observed the vehicle parked in the street beforehand. The accounts given by witnesses varied as to the number of occupants. None could provide more than a general description of their features and clothing. 
     
      
    5   However, the vehicle itself was described. It was white, perhaps ten years old, and of Japanese make. It had a registration number with a prefix “KPT”. It also had a roof rack. 
     
      
       
      The Murder Weapon 
       
      
    6   Approximately one month after these events (on 24 March 1993), Mr Baartman went to a flat in Kings Cross. The flat was occupied by a woman, given the name “Miss Brown”. Miss Brown had a young child. Mr Baartman showed Miss Brown a hand gun soon after his arrival. She screamed, and told him to place the gun in a linen cupboard. Soon thereafter Mr Baartman stumbled and collapsed. He lost consciousness. He began to turn blue. Miss Brown attempted to revive him, but was unable to do so. She therefore called an ambulance. 
     
      
    7   Several ambulance officers answered the call. Mr Baartman was lying on the floor. A child’s cot was moved to gain access to him. In moving the cot, a black pistol was uncovered near Mr Baartman. 
     
      
    8   The pistol was given to another ambulance officer, and secured in an ambulance. The police were called. Mr Baartman gradually regained consciousness. He was seen to pick up a black calculator, and then throw it down. He then went to his jacket, which he also picked up. His actions were described by the ambulance officer in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        “… (he) was feeling the pockets, and searching, just feeling the jacket and put it down.” 
        
       
      
    9   After the ambulance officer left the room, Miss Brown said she had a conversation with Mr Baartman. He was sitting up, and leaning against the wall. She said this: (T.144) 
     
      
       
        
        “A. … it was hard for him to get much sense out of… I tried to tell him that the police were coming, that they’d found the gun that he supposedly left in the linen cupboard and the police were coming, and he said it was a murder weapon.” 
        
       
      
    10   The police arrived. They took possession of the pistol. It was later examined by ballistics experts. The imprint made by the pistol matched that of the bullet recovered from the body of the deceased. Ballistics evidence was given (which was not challenged) that the pistol was the murder weapon. 
     
      
    11   Miss Brown was interviewed immediately after the discovery of the pistol. She said that she had not seen it before. However, some months later she changed her account. She recounted the conversation with Mr Baartman set out above. She did so after she had been interviewed by police in connection with another matter, described as a “rip off” involving $6,000. Miss Brown acknowledged that she had told the police a number of lies, both in connection with the “rip off”, and other matters. She said that she would do anything to protect her child, and not to lose custody of that child. 
     
      
    12   Once the pistol had been identified as the murder weapon, Mr Baartman was arrested. He was charged with having concealed a serious offence. Some publicity was apparently given to his arrest. 
     
      
       
      The Evidence of Mr Bicanic 
       
      
    13   It was in this context that Mr Bicanic came forward. He had seen the publicity. He acknowledged a fear that he may also be charged with having concealed a serious offence. At first, he attempted to furnish the police with information anonymously. A solicitor wrote a letter on his behalf. He later agreed to provide the police with a statement. Indeed, he agreed to allow the police to enter the flat in which he was then living, to install a listening device. 
     
      
    14   Mr Bicanic said that on 19 or 20 February 1993 (that is, a few days before the murder) he moved into a flat at Waterloo. The flat was occupied by a number of men. One was Paul Crofts, and another was Mr Baartman, the appellant. He had not met Mr Baartman before. 
     
      
    15   At about 1.00 am, a person, Chris Sharpe, came to the door. He went with Paul Crofts to a bedroom. They spoke for about ten minutes, after which Mr Sharpe left. 
     
      
    16   Mr Paul Crofts then spoke to Mr Baartman, in the presence of Mr Bicanic. The conversation was in these terms: (T.35) 
     
      
       
        
        “Paul Crofts was saying that Chris Sharpe is going to get them another gun or fix the gun because it didn’t work. Jon Baartman was in a sort of a boasting sort of way saying that, ‘I’m glad I tried the gun’ or ‘tested it’ and that he had found out it didn’t work.” 
        
       
      
    17   The gun was described as a “Barretta”, or “a little black gun”. 
     
      
    18   The following evening Mr Bicanic saw Mr Baartman again. This was Tuesday 23 February 1993, the day of the murder. He said Mr Baartman came to the unit at about 7.30 p.m. He witnessed a further conversation which was as follows: (T.76) 
     
      
       
        
        “Paul Crofts said that they were going to try again tonight, being the Tuesday, that the gun should work this time, and he was saying that Wayne Crofts - Paul Crofts’ brother - yes, brother, - was going to drive them there and that Jon Baartman was going to keep cocky, or keep a look out.” 
        
       
      
    19   Paul Crofts was going to fire the bullet. He had the Barretta, the black gun. Mr Baartman, according to Mr Bicanic, had another gun. It was described as being a “silvery metal colour”. 
     
      
    20   Paul Crofts outlined the plan. Chris Sharpe (known as “Big Boy”) wanted a man, Tony, shot. Tony lived at Lugarno. Mr Bicanic said this: (T.77) 
     
      
       
        
        “Paul Crofts said that they will be paid $1,000 to do this job, to shoot a man in the leg, that it was going to be split up between himself, Wayne Crofts, being the driver, and Jon Baartman for being the look-out.” 
        
       
      
    21   Tony had been “playing up” with the wife of a friend of Chris Sharpe. 
     
      
    22   Mr Bicanic said that he saw Paul Crofts return to the unit at about 11.30 pm. Mr Baartman came to the flat over the next few weeks. He heard Paul Crofts say to him that if he were ever caught with the Barretta, he should tell the police he got it from someone in Kings Cross. 
     
      
    23   Mr Bicanic described Wayne Crofts’ vehicle. It was a white station wagon, an older model, with roof racks. The police located a vehicle with a registration plate KPT.549. It was a white 1979 Corolla station wagon. It had once had roof racks. It had since been sold to an auto wrecker. 
     
      
       
      The Case for the Appellant 
       
      
    24   The appellant made an unsworn statement. He denied any wrongdoing. He denied knowing Mr Bicanic. He never went to the unit at Waterloo. He did not know Paul Crofts, his brother Wayne Crofts, or others said to have been involved in the shooting. 
     
      
    25   Mr Baartman sought to answer evidence called by the Crown, designed to prove an association with Paul Crofts. A hotel manager had been called by the Crown, who remembered Mr Baartman drinking almost every day with a person who, from photographs, was identified as Paul Crofts. Mr Baartman said that he did drink at that hotel with a person he knew as “Kel”. He had since learned that that person was Paul Crofts. He had no association with Kel outside the hotel. 
     
      
    26   Mr Baartman’s statement dealt briefly with the evidence of Miss Brown. It was Miss Brown who had told him that the gun was a murder weapon, not the other way around. He knew nothing of the gun. When he felt his jacket, he was looking for cigarettes. 
     
      
       
      The Notice of Appeal 
       
      
    27   The Notice of Appeal raised four issues, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) His Honour erred when directing the jury on circumstantial evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) His Honour’s directions on the second element of murder, (that the accused must have an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased), were flawed. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) His Honour failed to warn the jury that Bicanic’s evidence may be unreliable and there was a need for caution in determining whether to accept his evidence and the weight to be given to his evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) His Honour failed to remind the jury of a warning earlier given (summing up p9) when dealing with the evidence of ‘Miss Brown’. pp52-56.” 
        
       
      
    28   I will deal with each ground in turn. 
     
      
       
      The Circumstantial Evidence Direction 
       
      
    29   His Honour began his directions concerning circumstantial evidence with the standard direction based upon Peacock v The King (1911) 13 CLR 619. He said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Before you can convict on circumstantial evidence, however, you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the facts as found by you are not consistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused is guilty.” 
        
       
      
    30   His Honour then reminded the jury that it was the cumulative weight of circumstances, not the quality of proof of each circumstance, which must guide them. He said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “But that does not mean you should consider each circumstance by itself and consider whether that circumstances is consistent with innocence and then move on to the next circumstance.” 
        
       
      
    31   There followed, in his Honour’s directions, the passage about which complaint is made. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is the combination and totality of the circumstances that you find proved that you must look at, and you must consider whether that combination and totality of circumstances is consistent with innocence. If it is, then it is your duty to acquit…” 
        
       
      
    32   The directions, on this aspect, concluded with a restatement of the Peacock direction, in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “… but if, having regard to the nature, totality and combination of circumstances, you are satisfied beyond reasonable (doubt) that the circumstances are consistent only with guilt, then it is your duty to convict.” 
        
       
      
    33   A number of complaints are made by the appellant concerning these directions. 
     
      
    · First, it is said that the direction reversed the onus of proof. It suggested, inappropriately, that the applicant had the burden of establishing his innocence. 
     
      
    · Secondly, the directions made the contrast between innocence and guilt. The true contrast was between guilt proved beyond reasonable doubt, and a failure to prove guilt to that standard. 
     
      
    · Thirdly, the jury’s mind was, misleadingly, directed to the totality of proven facts. The test, however, did not require proven facts. It simply required an hypothesis consistent with innocence, or inconsistent with guilt. The test, therefore, was much less demanding. 
     
      
    34   A complaint along similar lines was made against the summing up by the same Judge (Dunford J) in R v Velevski [1999] NSWCCA 96. The summing up on circumstantial evidence was in the same terms (see para 13). Grove J (with whom James and Kirby JJ agreed), said this: (para 14) 
     
      
       
        
        “It was argued that the expression ‘consistent with innocence’ appearing twice in the above passage was, on first appearance suggestive and on second appearance effective, of reversing the onus of proof. I am unpersuaded that such a conclusion is fairly open. In context, his Honour was elaborating the meaning and application of his instructions concerning the appellant’s entitlement to be acquitted unless the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the facts were inconsistent with any other rational conclusion other than that the accused was guilty.” 
        
       
      
    35   His Honour made it very clear to the jury that Mr Baartman was not required to establish his innocence. His directions on onus included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not for the accused to prove his innocence. He is presumed to be innocent unless and until the Crown has proved him guilty. The responsibility or onus, as it is called, of proving the case is on the Crown and it remains on the Crown from the beginning to the end of the trial.” 
        
       
      
    36   Shortly before the direction about which complaint is made, his Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is one further matter relevant to the question of inferences. You have already heard it said that an accused is not obliged to prove his innocence and not obliged to say anything.” 
        
       
      
    37   Moving to the second complaint, it is not uncommon, in the context of circumstantial evidence, for the direction to be given either in terms of eliminating an hypothesis consistent with innocence, or the evidence only being consistent with guilt. In Peacock v The King (supra), Griffith CJ said this: (at 634) 
     
      
       
        
        “The rule is sometimes stated that the circumstances must be such as to be inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused.” 
        
       
      
    38   In Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573, McHugh J expressed the rule in these terms: (at 592/3) 
     
      
       
        
        “Ordinarily, in a circumstantial evidence case, guilt is inferred from a number of circumstances - often numerous - which taken as a whole eliminate the hypothesis of innocence. The cogency of the inference of guilt is derived from the cumulative weight of circumstances, not the quality of proof of each circumstance.” 
        
       
      
    39   Whilst I believe that it is preferable to formulate the direction by reference to guilt rather than innocence, no error has been established. 
     
      
    40   Turning, then, to the third complaint, the jury was asked to look at the totality of circumstances “that you find proved”, and then enquire whether that was consistent with innocence. That was, on the appellant’s argument, a more demanding test than was appropriate. The appropriate test required simply an hypothesis consistent with innocence. In formulating such an hypothesis, proven facts were not required. Possible facts were enough. The appellant drew attention to R v McIntyre [2000] NSWCCA 6, where Hulme J (with whom Sully and Hidden JJ agreed) said this: (at para 30/31) 
     
      
       
        
        “30. It is, of course, both proper and common for a judge in the course of a summing up to tell a jury that they must not speculate or guess, operations of the mind quite different from the drawing of inferences. However, as his Honour pointed out to the jury, this was a circumstantial evidence case. The appellant was entitled to be acquitted if the Crown could not exclude all reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence. 
        
       
       
        
        31. Such hypotheses must, as I have said, be reasonable. But a jury does not have to be able to infer that an event, the subject of such an hypothesis, in fact occurred before relying on, or making allowance for, the possibility of such an event. …” 
        
       
      
    41   His Honour was concerned, appropriately, to ensure that the jury did not consider each circumstance in isolation. The use by his Honour of the words “consistent with innocence” is a reference not to proven facts, but to the possibility of innocence; that is an hypothesis consistent with innocence. There is no substance, therefore, in the complaints made by the appellant. 
     
      
    42   There was a further aspect to the first ground of appeal. Having given the directions set out above, his Honour then identified an essential circumstance (Shepherd v The Queen (supra)). He said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having regard to the Crown case and the way the trial has been conducted, one of the matters or circumstances of which you would have to be satisfied in this case is that the accused was at or near the scene of the shooting (on) the evidence (on) 23 February 1993, not necessarily at the front door or the front gate or on the footpath outside the premises, but either nearby, keeping lookout or waiting in the getaway car or otherwise in the area with a common intention to support or assist the person who did the shooting.” 
        
       
      
    43   The appellant complains that his presence at the scene was a crucial intermediate fact. His Honour was, therefore, obliged to instruct the jury that it needed to be satisfied as to that fact beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    44   However, such an instruction was given. Indeed it was given immediately after the passage set out above. His Honour gave the jury the following direction: 
     
      
       
        
        “I will explain this in more detail when I come to deal with common purpose but before you could be satisfied that he was involved in the shooting, one of the circumstances of which you would have to be satisfied would be that he was in Lugarno that evening. This is a circumstance of which, although it may itself be proved by the combination and totality of other circumstances, you would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt before you could be satisfied in accordance with the principles I have given you about circumstantial evidence that the accused was involved in the shooting.” 
        
       
      
    45   I would reject, therefore, the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The Direction on Intent 
       
      
    46   The second ground of appeal was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(ii) His Honour’s directions on the second element of murder, (that the accused must have an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased), were flawed.” 
        
       
      
    47   The Crown case was one of common purpose. The plan was to shoot “Tony” in the leg. Tony lived at a particular address in Lugarno. The plan, however, went badly wrong. Paul Crofts (and those with him) went to the wrong address. He shot the wrong man, and he shot him in the abdomen, not the leg. The appellant was said to be the “look out” for the group. 
     
      
    48   That being the context, the appellant made a number of complaints in respect of his Honour’s direction as to intent. 
     
      
    · First, that it failed to put clearly whether intentionally firing a bullet at the victim’s leg amounted to intentionally inflicting grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
        
      
    · Secondly, that his Honour, irrelevantly, and misleadingly, made reference to intention to kill. That was never the Crown case. The Crown case was a common purpose to shoot the victim in the leg. 
     
      
    · Thirdly, his Honour said to the jury that where a specific result was the obvious and inevitable consequence of the act, it may readily infer that the person intended that result. Such a direction, in circumstances where the victim had died, was unfortunate. It diverted the jurors from the real issues which were: 
     
      
    · whether Mr Baartman was part of the common purpose to shoot the victim in the leg, 
     
      
    · whether that amounted to intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and 
     
      
    · whether the common purpose embraced the possibility of grievous bodily harm through incompetence or misadventure. 
     
      
    · Fourthly, that his Honour, at a vital point of his directions, misstated the meaning of grievous bodily harm. He referred to an intention to cause “serious injury”, rather than an intention to cause “really serious injury” (R v Gary Perks (1986) 20 A Crim R 201 at 210). That, it was suggested, was an important error where the common purpose alleged by the Crown was shooting in the leg (from which a victim may well recover). 
     
      
    49   In support of these submissions, the appellant pointed to particular directions given by his Honour. It is important, however, to examine the whole of what his Honour said on this aspect. He said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Secondly, the act must be done with intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. Grievous bodily harm means really serious bodily injury. Was the act of shooting done with an intention to carry out or inflict grievous bodily harm, really serious bodily injury, upon some other persons, that is the question. There can be no doubt that such an injury was in fact inflicted in this case. 
        
       
       
        
        The issue here is not whether, in fact, such an injury was inflicted but whether such an injury was intended. The Crown does not press that it was done with an intention to kill. It is not necessary for the Crown to prove that. It is sufficient that the Crown proves that the shooting was done with an intention to cause really serious physical injury. Was that the specific result which the person who fired the gun sought to achieved (sic) by the act which in fact caused the death? … The Crown says that here the specific act is firing the gun. 
        
       
       
        
        There is evidence that the intention was to shoot someone in the leg. The Crown says that no one would have done that to another person without intending to at last cause really serious bodily injury to that other person. If you accept the Crown case, the evidence is that there was an intention to shoot someone in the leg, not in the abdomen. It is a question of fact for you but you may well consider that to shoot someone in the leg at close range with a .32 calibre pistol would cause really serious physical injury, and a person would only shoot another person in the leg in those circumstances if he intended to cause the other person really serious physical injury to his leg. If that was the intention, that is sufficient to satisfy the element of murder, the intention to cause grievous bodily harm. I direct you as a matter of law that it does not matter that the wrong person was shot. If there was an intention to cause serious physical injury to one person and another person gets killed, that is sufficient intent to constitute murder."" (S/U 18-19) 
        
       
      
    50   Dealing with the appellant’s arguments one by one, first, I believe the direction was clear. The jury was provided with the definition of grievous bodily harm. It was told it was a question of fact, and a matter for them. His Honour made a comment. However, he was entitled to do so. 
     
      
    51   Moving to the second complaint, I cannot accept that the reference to an intention to kill was misleading. The jury was reminded of the way in which the Crown put its case. It was told that it did not include an intention to kill. 
     
      
    52   Thirdly, his Honour gave the conventional direction on intention, which was entirely appropriate. The jury would have been in no doubt that it was required to determine whether shooting someone in the leg could be characterised as an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. His Honour later dealt with the issues which arise where it is suggested there was a common purpose. He provided appropriate guidance as to whether consequences outside the defined purpose were contemplated as possible consequences of carrying out the common intention (S/U 20-24). 
     
      
    53   Fourthly, whilst his Honour occasionally used the words “serious bodily injury” when referring to grievous bodily harm, omitting the word “really”, the jury cannot have been in doubt. His Honour defined the term “grievous bodily harm”. He repeatedly used the phrase “really serious bodily injury”. Counsel who appeared at the trial made no objection to his Honour’s direction. 
     
      
    54   I would reject the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: Was there a Failure to Give a Warning? 
       
      
    55   Ground three was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ”(iii) His Honour failed to warn the jury that Bicanic’s evidence may be unreliable and there was a need for caution in determining whether to accept his evidence and the weight to be given to his evidence.” 
         
        
       
      
    56   Mr Bicanic’s evidence was fundamental to the Crown case. He was the only witness who gave evidence of common purpose, and Mr Baartman’s participation in that purpose. Indeed, his Honour told the jury this: (S/U p47) 
     
      
       
        
        “If you do not accept the substance of Mr Bicanic’s evidence as truthful, there would be very little evidence against the accused, except for the finding of the murder weapon a month later, allegedly in his presence.” 
        
       
      
    57   There are a number of issues: 
     
      
    · First, was there a request for a warning in respect of the evidence of Mr Bicanic? (cf s165(2)) 
     
      
    · Secondly, was there a need to give a warning? 
     
      
    · Thirdly, was there error, having regard to the directions given concerning Mr Bicanic? 
     
      
    58   Counsel for the appellant addressed the jury on the assumption that his Honour would provide a warning that Mr Bicanic’s evidence may be unreliable. Before counsel had concluded his address, and in the absence of the jury, the need for such a warning was debated. A full transcript of the debate was not taken. The Crown contended that the only request made was for a warning under s165(1)(d) of the Evidence Act, 1995. That section is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “s165(1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding.” 
        
       
      
    59   His Honour determined that Mr Bicanic was not such a person. That determination was plainly right. Mr Bicanic was a bystander. He had overheard conversations. There was no evidence that he shared in the common purpose. 
     
      
    60   The appellant contended, however, that the request for a warning was more general. It was not confined to s165(1)(d). Since the transcript of the argument is incomplete, I am prepared to assume that a more general request was made. 
     
      
    61   Section 165(1) is not an “exclusive code” (Beazley JA (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Sperling J agreed) in R v Lewis (CCA, unreported, 8 September 1998) at p17. The opening words of s165(1) make it clear that the circumstances in which evidence may be unreliable extend beyond the classes of evidence identified by subsections (a) to (g). The terms of his Honour’s judgement make it plain that he recognised that this was so. He nonetheless declined to give a warning. Was he in error? 
     
      
    62   In the nature of things, evidence given by all witnesses may be unreliable. Evidence is necessarily dependent upon observation and recollection. Both are fallible. However, s165 is not dealing with unreliability in this sense. Rather, the need for a warning typically arises either because the jury needs to be acquainted with the accumulated experience of courts in dealing with certain types of evidence, or because there is the danger that the jury may over-estimate the probative value of certain evidence (see ALRC 26, Vol 1, para 1017). In Bromley v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 315, Brennan J said the following: (at 325) 
     
      
       
        
        “When the danger in acting upon the evidence is real and substantial and when the conduct of the trial and evidence … are such that the jury may not have fully perceived or the jury’s attention may have been diverted from the danger, a warning should be given.” 
        
       
      
    63   Brennan J added: (at 323) 
     
      
       
        
        “If the danger is equally obvious to the lay mind, a failure to warn of its existence is much less likely to result in a miscarriage of justice and thus much less likely to provide a ground for quashing a conviction than if the court has a special knowledge of the danger. If the danger is so obvious that the jury are fully alive to it without a warning, no warning need be given.” 
        
       
      
    64   In Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79, Deane J made a similar observation: (at 95-96) 
     
      
       
        
        “[The] responsibility [of a trial judge] includes the giving of an appropriate caution or warning in circumstances where there are potential dangers in acting upon particular evidence which may not, without such a caution or warning, be appreciated by the jury.” 
        
       
      
    65   See also Farrell v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 286. 
     
      
    66   Here, two matters were said to have made Mr Bicanic’s evidence unreliable, such that there was a need for a specific warning under s165. First, Mr Bicanic acknowledged a fear that he may be charged with having concealed a serious offence. He provided information in the context of that fear. Secondly, there was delay in Mr Bicanic coming forward. The conversations which he recounted took place before 23 February 1993. He came forward in June 1993. 
     
      
    67   However, I believe both matters would have been obvious to a jury. His Honour, as you would expect, provided general guidance to the jury as to the way in which it should assess the evidence given by witnesses. His directions included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Another matter you may consider is whether some particular interest or purpose of the witness will be served or promoted by giving particular evidence or saying particular things, or whether the witness is a relation, friend or associate of a person whose particular interest or purpose will be served or promoted by particular evidence.” 
        
       
      
    68   His Honour dealt with the evidence of Mr Bicanic at some length (S/U p34-47). His analysis included the points made in cross examination. He dealt with Mr Bicanic’s fear of prosecution, his attempt to provide the information anonymously, and the circumstances in which he implicated Mr Baartman. His Honour returned to these issues when summarising the submissions of the appellant’s counsel. He said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “So therefore, to protect himself so that he will not be charged with concealing a serious offence, he puts the defendant together with Paul Crofts and that story will fit in with the finding of the gun at Kings Cross. Otherwise, the finding of a gun at Kings Cross will come back to him in some way.” 
        
       
      
    69   In circumstances where evidence does not fall within s165(1)(a) to (g), and does not fall within any Common Law requirement for a warning (cf s165(6)), a trial Judge may be called upon to determine whether, in a particular case, a warning is required. Questions of judgement arise. On such questions reasonable minds may differ. An appellate court should only intervene where a warning was plainly necessary. It will be necessary where the danger of acting upon the evidence is real and substantial, and unlikely to have been fully perceived by the jury in the absence of a warning. 
     
      
    70   Here the circumstances in respect of Mr Bicanic were quite different from those in respect of Miss Brown. His Honour gave a warning in respect of Miss Brown. Miss Brown had been arrested in connection with the “rip off”. She sought, and obtained, advantage through the provision of information. Her evidence could not be characterised as coming within one of the subparagraphs of s.165. Yet, her position was analogous to that of a prison informer. She traded information for advantage to herself. His Honour determined, in those circumstances, that a warning was appropriate. 
     
      
    71   However, Mr Bicanic came forward at a time when there was nothing to implicate him in the murder. The publicity surrounding discovery of the gun did not suggest a connection with the occupants of the unit in which Mr Bicanic resided. His position was in no way analogous to that of Miss Brown.  
     
      
    72   It could not be said, in these circumstances, that a warning in respect of Mr Bicanic was plainly necessary. The issue, I believe, was exposed in the addresses by counsel, and by the terms of the summing up. In my view there no was error. I would reject the third ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: Failure to Refer Again to the Warning 
       
      
    73   Ground four was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(iv) His Honour failed to remind the jury of a warning earlier given (summing up p9) when dealing with the evidence of ‘Miss Brown’. pp52-56.” 
        
       
      
    74   His Honour began his summing up by providing directions of law (pp 1-24). He then identified a number of issues, and the evidence relevant to such issues. One such issue was the circumstances in which the gun was found in Miss Brown’s flat (p 52 ff). No complaint is made by the appellant concerning the warning administered in connection with Miss Brown’s evidence. Nor is there complaint concerning the outline provided by his Honour in respect of the evidence of Miss Brown, and others, relating to the finding of the gun. The only complaint is that his Honour failed to relate one to the other, and remind the jury of his earlier warning. 
     
      
    75   There is, in my view, no substance in this complaint. It was a relatively short summing up. Counsel for the appellant did not ask that the jury be reminded of the earlier warning. Although it would have been appropriate, and helpful, to have reminded the jury of the earlier warning, there is no error in having failed to have done so. I would therefore reject this ground. 
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    76   The order that I would therefore propose is that the appeal be dismissed.

      WEDNESDAY 13TH SEPTEMBER 2000: 
     
     
      
     Regina v Kevin James KIRBY 
     
     
      
    The appellant was convicted of two counts of robbery under s97(1) Crimes Act 1900. In respect of each count, he was sentenced to concurrent terms of penal servitude for ten years, comprising a minimum term of six years and ten months and an additional term of 3 years and 2 months. He appealed against the conviction and sought leave to appeal against the severity of sentence on grounds that: (1) the trial judge erred in permitting the course of cross examination taken by the Crown which allowed the jury to make a comparison between the accused and some security camera stills; (2) the trial judge erred in his directions concerning identification evidence; (3) the cross examination of the appellant concerning the possible alibi evidence was unfair and risked a miscarriage of justice.HELD (dismissing the appeals and confirming conviction and sentence):Ground 1: Comparison of accused with security camera photographs(1) Having the jury view the appellant while wearing his hat, was not akin to a dock identification, nor was it impermissible. The jury were not being asked to make an identification reliant upon their own memories, they were merely making a comparison of evidence. The procedure was not unfair so as to attract exclusion under s137 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).Sorby (1983) 152 CLR 281, Bulejcik (1995) 185 CLR 375; Lockyer (1996) 89 ACrimR 457; Singh-Bal (1997) 92 ACrim R 397; Blick [2000] NSWCCA 61 applied.Ground 2: Absence of warning(3) The Evidence Act and authorities such as Kerrie-Ann Clarke, Cody and Davis and Dominican, require a specific warning to be given in regard to the dangers of identification evidence, together with the reasons for such a warning, generally and in relation to the particular case. (4) Although , the present case could be distinguished because it did not concern the evidence of an eyewitness making direct identification from their own memory, but was a comparison of evidence. It was appropriate to give the warning of the kind contemplated by Section 165(1) of the Evidence Act.(5) Neither the Evidence act nor authority prescribe any particular form of direction to be given; the direction given by the trial judge was sufficient to adequately warn the jury of the need for caution when assessing the photographic evidence. Kerrie-Ann Clarke distinguished(6)The fact that the caution was not given at the time of the comparison exercise did not risk a miscarriage of justice because the case was not lengthy or complex, and there was no particular point during the trial where the warning would have been best given. No warning was sought at the time, the prosecution case was compelling, and therefore leave under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal rules was refused.Ground 3: Cross examination of the appellant concerning the possible alibi evidence(6) In cross examination the Crown without objection inappropriately questioned the appellant about his failure to call his wife and Ms Mapp who, on the face of the ERISP which was in evidence, were potential alibi witnesses. However, the defence placed before the jury the contents of the wife’s statement which tended to assist the defence and an explanation for the absence of the other witness. No Jones v Dunkel direction was given and no unfairness to the appellant was occasioned. RPS 74 ALJR 449 consideredSENTENCE (7) A number of aggravating circumstances, together with the subjective position of the appellant, and the stern approach taken by the NSWCCA in relation to serious armed robberies, justified the sentences imposed. No special circumstances existed to qualify the appellant for a reduction in the overall sentence.

     Regina v Kevin James KIRBY 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
    1   BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Wood CJ at CL.2   WOOD CJ at CL: On 27 May 1999, the appellant was convicted of two counts of robbery, after a trial in the District Court before Shillington DCJ and a jury. He was sentenced, in respect of each count, to concurrent terms of penal servitude for ten years, comprising a minimum term of six years and ten months (taking into account a further period of eight months pre-trial custody), and an additional term of 3 years and 2 months. He now appeals against the convictions, and seeks leave to appeal against the sentences. 
    3   It was the Crown case that the appellant, in company with Paul Beveridge Wilkinson, committed robberies at the Waverton and Epping Railway Stations, on 22 July and 28 July 1997. They were offences for which the maximum penalty available on conviction is imprisonment for twenty years (97(1) Crimes Act 1900). The sums of money stolen were $1562.20 and $2,850 respectively. 
     
      
     Count 1 
      
    4   Evidence was called from Mr. Corcoran, a station assistant at Waverton Railway Station, that at about 8.10pm he was in the process of securing the station for a close down. As he was about to unlock the stationmaster’s door, he became aware of a man wearing a black overcoat, holding a gun. This man said “Just do as I say and you won’t be shot”. Following instructions, he opened the door to the office. The gunman entered behind him and pulled a black balaclava over his head. He was followed by another man who was wearing a red balaclava with a blue stripe. The gunman, who instructed him to sit on the floor, and not to touch any security buttons, removed the cash from the drawer and cash tray, while the second man commenced to drill the safe with a power tool. Further cash was taken from the safe.  
    5   When the two men left the station, the gunman said “Right, don’t do anything for (he thought a minute) because there is another person outside”. 
    6   Mr. Corcoran was shown a video of 13 photographs of male persons on 11 September 1997. He identified the gunman as the co-accused Wilkinson. He was unable to identify the gun but he did identify the dark overcoat that the gunman had been wearing. The coat had been recovered by police from Wilkinson’s home. 
    7   Mr. Corcoran told police, in February 1999, that he did “not really get a look at the second man and because of the lapse of time” there was no point in showing him the second video that was seen by the other witnesses. 
    8   The description he gave of the gunman was of a male, about 180 cms tall and of an average build. The second man, he said, was of a much bigger build. He was unable to provide any description of his clothing other than the red balaclava. 
    9   Stills obtained from the video security cameras at the station, showing the offenders, were tendered in evidence. The stills of the second man that showed his face and clothing assumed considerable importance in the appellant’s trial. 
     
      
     Count 2 
      
    10   Mr. Sandy Harrison, a station assistant at Epping Railway Station, gave evidence that, at about 9.30pm, as he was returning to the office after changing the indicator board, he became aware of a man standing behind him with a gun. He was instructed to go inside, where he and Mr. Bruce Malouf, the booking clerk, were taken to the back of the booking office. The gunman asked Mr. Malouf’s advice as to how to open the safe. As Mr Malouf obtained the combination from the book that contained the necessary code, and attempted to open the safe, a second man entered the office. He was wearing a Khaki Akubra hat and was carrying a large blue nylon bag. Mr. Malouf appeared to have difficulty opening the safe, and the second man took over from him. He was able to use the combination from the code book to open the safe, but could not get access to an inner compartment. Mr. Harrison then saw him go to work on it using an angle grinder, a spanner and hammer.  
    11   After trying unsuccessfully for a time to open the inner safe, the two men packed up their gear, put their Akubra hats on and left. Before leaving one of the men said, “Wait 30 seconds, we have got someone out there watching and waiting”. 
    12   The first man, Mr. Harrison said, was about five foot eight or five-nine in height, with a skinny build. He was wearing gym boots and a blue bomber jacket, which had “something about plumbing” on it. The description he gave of the second man was of a much bigger male, between five-eight and five-ten in height. He was a bit chubby, had slightly long hair sticking out at the back, and a bit of growth around the mouth and chin. He was wearing a greyish coloured corduroy jacket, a yellow T-shirt, green track pants and black and white cross trainer type shoes. At one stage he donned a red and white coloured beanie which was pulled down. 
    13   Mr. Harrison identified the gunman, at North Sydney Police Station on 18 September 1997, from the video, as the co-accused Wilkinson. He also identified the blue “plumbers” jacket when it was shown to him by police, and the gun which was found in Wilkinson’s possession. 
    14   Mr. Malouf gave evidence of seeing the gunman walk to the door of the office from across the concourse. He assumed that he wished to ask a question about the running of the trains. However, when he opened the barrier room door to let the man in, the latter produced a firearm, and asked that the safe be opened. The description he gave was of a man about 5 feet 9 inches tall, with short dark hair, of slim to medium build, clean shaven, and wearing a dark blue jacket with a lighter logo “plumbers” stitched onto it. Soon after coming into the office this man pulled a black balaclava over his face.  
    15   At the gunman’s instruction he obtained the combination for the safe, which had already been shut for the night. While attempting to open the safe, a task with which he had some difficulties, he saw a second man come into the office carrying a big blue vinyl bag. This man took over the opening of the safe. Money was removed from it when it was opened, and placed into the blue bag.  
    16   The second man then asked for advice as to the way in which the second safe could be opened. The outer compartment was opened with the key that was kept in the combination safe. However, the inner security compartment, which contained a great deal more money, and which could only be opened by an SRA employee and security guard, each with their own key, could not be opened. The second man then went to work on it with an angle grinder, a pair of pliers, a cold chisel, a claw hammer and a large spanner.  
    17   This second man, he described, as about 5 feet 11 inches tall, with a fair complexion, reddish to brown hair collar length and a light wispy beard. He was fairly obese and was wearing a brown corduroy jacket, blue coloured track pants and a red coloured balaclava which he pulled over his face after entering the office. 
    18   The attempts to open the security compartment of the second safe were unsuccessful, and after about 30 minutes the two men donned their Akubra hats and walked off carrying the bag between them. Before leaving they said “give us 30 seconds to a minute to get away because we have got someone outside waiting, waiting for us”.  
    19   On 13 September 1997, Mr. Malouf identified the gunman as Wilkinson, from the thirteen photographs shown to him. He also identified the “plumbers jacket” (Exhibit “J”) as the one worn by the gunman, and the gun which that man had used. It was the weapon found in Wilkinson’s possession when he was arrested. Later in October, when he was shown a videotape with photographs of twelve men, he said to police that the two males who looked most similar to the second man were males number 4 and 9, “but it is so long ago and he had his balaclava over his face most of the time so I can’t really remember.” Neither of the males was the appellant. 
    20   Mr. Vaughan Pinto, a station assistant who reported for duty a little earlier than rostered that night, gave evidence of seeing a man with a gun when he walked from the barrier room into the booking office. This man was wearing a balaclava, and a dark blue or green jacket with the word “plumber” on it, in gold letters. He was about 169 cms tall and of a slim build. He was wearing one glove. 
    21   Mr. Pinto heard the sound of an angle grinder from around the corner of the L-shaped office. Although he did not see the grinder in use, he later saw another man come from around the corner. He was wearing a dark coloured jacket, with a grey Akubra covering his face. He was a much taller and bigger man than the gunman - a bit overweight. His hair was “darkish or brownie sort of coloured,” and it came down under his hat. He had “like a goatee”. Both men left the premises carrying a big blue bag between them. 
    22   On 18 September 1997, Mr. Pinto identified the gunman, as Wilkinson, from the video. He also identified the “plumbers” jacket and the gun. On a second occasion, he was shown a video line-up of a different group, but he was unable to identify the second man. 
     
      
     Other evidence 
      
    23   Wilkinson and the appellant were arrested on 4th August 1997. A shortened firearm was found in Wilkinson’s possession as was the long black overcoat, which the witness Corcoran identified as that worn by the gunman at Waverton.  
    24   During the ERISP conducted with the appellant, that day, he denied that the person depicted in the photograph taken by the surveillance camera at Waverton Railway Station, wearing an Akubra style hat, was him. He denied having been there on 22 July 1997, or over the preceding four weeks. He also denied having committed the robbery at the Epping Railway Station, a place he said that he had not visited for years. He acknowledged owning a mobile phone (0417 217538) which had been leased in the name of Paul Wilkinson, because he had insufficient identification to obtain a phone in his own name.  
    25   The appellant was invited to participate in an identification parade, but indicated that he wished first to receive legal advice. It did not proceed. 
    26   The appellant’s premises were searched on the morning of 5 August 1997. A number of items were found including a brown corduroy jacket; a blue vinyl bag; a pair of black and white running shoes; a number of Akubra hats (including one that was brown with a bit of grey); a pair of green track pants; a yellow T-shirt; a striped long sleeve T-shirt; a Hornets brand back pack; a fluorescent green shirt; a pair of brown suede gloves; an angle grinder; a hammer; a spanner and a cold chisel.  
    27   Additionally, police recovered from the appellant’s home a blue jacket with the word “plumber” stitched on it, that was consistent with the one worn by the gunman at the Epping robbery, being the one that the witnesses respectively identified at North Sydney Police Station. 
    28   There was evidence from a Telstra officer that there was a call made on the appellant’s mobile phone, to the Annandale home phone service (02) 9818 2992 leased to Wilkinson, at 4.46am on 22 July 1997, the date of the first robbery. It went through the Milson’s Point base station sector two. The appellant’s home was in Kent Street, Millers Point, a location capable of being served by the Milson’s Point cell. 
    29   Another call was made through these services on 24 July 1997, four days before the second robbery, which most likely went through the Epping base station sector 2. 
    30   The evidence of the telephone calls was relied upon as showing the existence of an association between the two accused, a matter that was further confirmed by surveillance conducted on the afternoon of 4 August 1997. On that afternoon Wilkinson was seen to drive to the appellant’s home and to pick him up in a motor vehicle. 
    31   A surveillance photograph (Ex AD) was taken on 30 July 1997 of the appellant and admitted into evidence, without objection. Its purpose was to facilitate comparison with the security video stills of the second man, by recording his appearance proximate in time to the robberies. Detective Banfield also gave evidence of his appearance at the time of his arrest, on 4 August 1997, as a man who was around 185/186 cms in height, overweight, with long brown curly hair tied in a small pony tail. He was unshaven and had several days’ growth that was of a lighter shade than his hair. 
    32   There was no scientific examination of the appellant’s clothing for traces of filings from the grinding or drilling tools used at the two robberies. No red coloured beanie, whether with or without a stripe, was found during the search of the appellant’s home. A blue and black striped beanie was, however, found. 
     
      
     The defence case 
      
    33   The appellant gave evidence at his trial. He denied being involved in either offence. He acknowledged having known Wilkinson for some time. 
    34   He also acknowledged ownership of the various tools, including the angle grinder found at his home, and tendered in evidence, but said that he had them for lawful purposes. The blue bag he said was his, but he denied that it was ever used to carry power tools. He said that he did not make the phone calls on 22 and 24 July, on the mobile phone. It was a phone that he said he had loaned to Wilkinson on occasions, although he could not recall when that had last occurred. 
    35   The grey corduroy jacket, yellow T-shirt and running shoes found at his home, he agreed, were his. The blue nylon jacket with the “plumbers” logo that was found on a hat rack in his home, however, was not his. He thought that it belonged to Wilkinson, but he could not explain how or when it found its way to the hat rack. 
    36   The several Akubra hats that were found he said “mainly” belonged to his children. He denied owning a red and white beanie or a red beanie with a blue stripe. He denied ever having worn the grey Akubra hat that was tendered in evidence. To the evidence concerning this hat, and the way in which it was used in his cross examination, I will return when I come to consider the first ground of appeal. 
    37   In the course of his cross examination, the appellant was asked to compare the items found by police at his home previously mentioned, with the various items of clothing or bags that could be seen in the video camera stills, particularly those relating to the “second man” at the Waverton robbery. He agreed that there was a similarity in appearance, style or size in almost every instance. He also agreed that the other man depicted in some of the security camera stills looked very much like Wilkinson, and that the “plumbing jacket” the man was wearing was the same as that found by police in his house. 
    38   In the course of his cross examination, the appellant was also questioned as to whether his de facto wife, or another young person, were going to be called in his case. To the significance of this cross examination, which is the subject of the third ground of appeal, I will return.  
     
      
     Ground 1 - Comparison of Accused with Security Camera Photographs 
      
    39   The appellant submitted that his Honour erred in permitting the course that was taken by the Crown Prosecutor, when cross examining the appellant in relation to the security stills of the second offender at Waverton Railway Station. 
    40   In the course of that cross examination, the appellant was asked to place on his head an Akubra hat, that had been found at his house (Ex P), being a hat that he agreed was similar to the hat seen in one of those stills (photograph Ex D5). 
    41   When he put it on, he said that it was a “bit big”. He was then asked to put it back on, to turn his head sideways and to pull the brim down a bit. At that point his counsel objected. His Honour allowed the prosecutor to continue, whereupon she put to the appellant that he was in fact, the person shown in two photographs (Exhibits D1 and D5). He disagreed. The jury was then, with his Honour’s consent, given the photographs, and allowed to view the appellant while he was wearing the hat. At one stage a juror asked him to tilt his head down. 
    42   It was submitted that this was an irregular course, akin to a dock identification. There was said to be an unfairness to the appellant because: 
     
      
     (a) of the suggestive or subliminal effect of an invitation to the jury to physically compare the photograph with the appellant as he sat in the witness box wearing the hat; 
      
      
     (b) the comparison invited was between a two dimensional photographic image and a three dimensional witness, and because 
      
      
     (c) the jury only had one person with whose appearance they were to make the comparison. 
      
    43   I am not persuaded that this argument has been made good. Nor am I persuaded that the course undertaken was akin to an identification of the kind that could not have been permitted had it involved a witness. The vice in a dock identification, or in a procedure that involves a witness examining a single person or a single photograph, lies in the strong suggestion that the person seen or depicted is the suspect. It has long been recognised that circumstances of this kind can subtly influence a witness identification that is based upon a memory of the features of an offender, who was previously unknown to the witness. There is, in such a procedure, a real potential for unfairness, because of the vagaries of memory, and because of the difficulties in laying down and preserving an image of a person seen fleetingly, in a dynamic situation, and often in conditions of poor lighting, or from a distance.  
     
      
    44   The dangers inherent in witness identification, and the risks of mistake, and of surrender of independent reliance upon personal recollection to the influence of suggestion, particularly in the case of dock identifications, (“the displacement effect”) and of any procedure that does not involve a physical line up or a photoboard, of a group of persons so selected, or so conducted, as to ensure that the suspect does not stand out, (as for example was the case in Blick [2000] NSWCCA 61) are well documented: Davis & Cody (1937) 57 CLR 170 at 181-182; Alexander (1981) 145 CLR 395; Domican (1992) 173 CLR 555; Kerrie Anne Clarke NSWCCA 31 October 1997 and Carusi (1997) 92 ACrimR 52. 
    45   The position is also now governed by SS116 and 165 of the Evidence Act 1995, which require a direction to the jury as to the special need for caution before accepting identification evidence, and an explanation of the reasons for it, both generally and in the circumstances of the particular case.  
    46   In the present case the jury were not being asked to make an identification reliant upon their own memories. They were doing no more than they inevitably would have done once the security photographs were tendered - ie, to examine them against the man in the dock, and against the various items of clothing and otherwise that had been found at his home and tendered in evidence. The difference is that they were making a comparison of evidence, not an identification from their own memories. 
    47   The demonstration by a witness of his or her personal appearance, or of the sound of his or her voice, or the provision of a sample of handwriting, and the wearing of a piece of clothing connected with a crime to see if it fits, are commonplace events and entirely unexceptional. They do not require any independent proof (Bulejcik (1995) 185 CLR 375 at 380-381) and their purpose is to enable a jury or other trier of fact to make their own comparison with other physical evidence before the Court: Sorby (1983) 152 CLR 281 at 292. The permissibility of such a procedure was expressly recognised by Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Bulejcik at 395, where their Honours said: 
     
      
       
       “Where two voices are being heard side by side, as occurred in the present case, the concern is not with familiarity or distinctiveness but with whether the quality and quantity of the material is sufficient to enable a useful comparison to be made. By way of analogy, asking a jury to compare a photograph of an accused with a security camera picture of the perpetrator of a robbery involves quite different considerations from asking a witness whether the accused is the person they remember seeing at the robbery.” 
       
      
    48   So much was conceded by counsel, whose submission rested, essentially, upon the proposition that the risk of unfair prejudice to the appellant, of a procedure requiring him to wear a hat while the jury had the security stills, outweighed the probative value attaching to it, thereby attracting its exclusion under S137 Evidence Act. This was said to arise because the exercise risked reminding the jury that the man wearing the hat in the dock was the offender, or subliminally reinforcing that contention. 
    49   For the reasons mentioned, and bearing in mind that it was both inevitable and necessary for the jury to pay close attention to the security videos, to the stills taken from them, to the photograph of the appellant taken within days of the offence, and to the descriptions given of the second offender by the State Rail staff and by the arresting officer, I am not persuaded that the procedure was unfair. It made sense, if a comparison was to be made, for the appellant to wear an Akubra hat of the kind worn by the offender, since that was how that person appeared in the stills and videos. 
    50   The comparison evidence, and the procedure had an obvious probative value, and the case was not one in which there was, to my mind, any risk of the jury giving the exercise an unwarranted weight, or of misusing it, or of being led into a process of evaluation or reasoning that was unjustified, and hence of a kind that would attract S 137 of the Evidence Act; Lockyer (1996) 89 ACrimR 457 and Singh-Bal (1997) 92 ACrimR 397; and see also Blick. In particular, it is impossible to accept the proposition that the jury ever lost sight of the fact that it was the Crown contention that the appellant was the second offender, or that the comparison exercise reminded them of that, or reinforced it in their minds. 
    51   This ground has not been made good. 
     
      
      Ground 2 - Absence of warning 
      
    52   In the summing up, his Honour gave a direction concerning the dangers of identification evidence in which he drew attention to the fact that the law recognises that mistakes in identification can be made. Additionally, he gave a warning concerning the use of the photographs, so far as he said: 
     
      
       
       “You will no doubt realise of course that photographs are a poor substitute for the real thing, seeing someone in the flesh there, if you had been there at Waverton and you had seen the person photographed that is obviously a more satisfactory way of making a comparison. The quality of the photograph, the definition of it are all matters which you should take into account, but it is nevertheless open to you members of the jury to say yes we are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that is a photograph of the accused, but I nevertheless warn you of the need to take extreme caution in going through that process”. 
       
      
    53   It was submitted that this direction was inadequate, and came too late, it being contended that a warning should also have been given when the comparison exercise was undertaken. No warning was sought at the time, nor was any redirection sought during the summing up. The appellant accordingly requires leave under R4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely upon this ground. 
    54   It is convenient, first, to deal with the adequacy of the summing up and with the argument that, in addition to the caution given, his Honour should have warned the jury that a photograph is only two dimensional, and records what a person, who may have been moving his or her features, looked like in the one split second, so that it may not always provide a safe impression of that person’s image. Further, it was submitted that his Honour should have adverted to the circumstance that as the hat covered part of the second man’s head, that made an accurate comparison difficult. Additionally, it was submitted that his Honour should have reminded the jury that they should not be swayed by the fact that the prosecution contended that the man in the photograph was the appellant, since they needed to be satisfied of that themselves. 
    55   As mentioned earlier, the Evidence Act does call for a specific direction as to the care needed in dealing with identification evidence, as well as an explanation of the reasons for it, both generally and in the circumstances of the instant case. It has been held that this now requires a greater emphasis to be given to the reasons for the warning, and that the Act provides a greater protection against the risk of miscarriage of justice, on this account, than did the common law: Kerryie Ann Clarke.  
    56   That decision, and decisions such as Davis and Cody and Domican, were concerned with the evidence of eyewitnesses, who claim to have made a direct identification from their own memory and not with a comparison exercise of the kind made by the jury in the present trial, and they are therefore, distinguishable. 
    57   Nevertheless, there remains good reason why, in principle, a similar warning should be given to a jury invited to make a comparison of the kind that had to be made in the present case. Section 165(1) of the Evidence Act is, in my view, applicable to a case where the central issue is whether the person seen in a video, or a photograph of a crime scene, is the person on trial. The giving of a caution is not confined to the particular circumstances identified in sub paras (a) to (g) of S 165(1), nor does its exercise depend exclusively, upon a party requesting a direction under S 165(2): Lewis NSWCCA 8 September 1998. 
    58   The power to give a warning concerning evidence that may be unreliable, or concerning the undertaking of an exercise that, in the light of judicial experience, may require special attention or care, continues independently of S. 165. It was that consideration, no doubt, which led his Honour to give the directions that were incorporated in the summing up. 
    59   The question that arises is whether those directions were “appropriate to the circumstances of the case” and whether they identified “for the benefit of the jury any matter of significance” which might reasonably have been regarded as weakening the value of the photographs or of the comparison exercise - to apply, by analogy the principle expressed in Domican at 561 to 562; and then to inform the jury of the reasons for the need for any caution that was required, both generally and in the particular circumstances of the case. Without an understanding of the reasons for care, and without the benefit of a clear judicial imprimatur, a jury can not be expected to apply a caution, where one is required, full-heartedly, or with a sufficient understanding of it. 
    60   Neither S 116 of the Evidence Act, nor authority before or since its enactment, call for any particular form of words to be used in the direction. It is true that in Kerrie-Ann Clarke Hunt CJ at CL did observe, in relation to the various inadequacies of the directions there given: 
     
      
       
       “The judge made no reference to the consequences of the absence of an identification parade. One important consequence is that the accused is not present when the identification is made from photographs as he or she inevitably is in an identification parade, and thus able to observe, and later bring to light, any unfairness in the way in which the parade was conducted, or any weakness in the way in which the witness made the identification. ( 
       Alexander v The Queen 
        at 400) 
        The judge made no reference to the possibility of a subconscious displacement effect upon Mrs. Smith’s description of the offenders when she came to give evidence. Nor did he explain the inadequacy of photographs by comparison with seeing persons in the flesh. A photograph is only two dimensional, and it records what a person looked like in the one split second when that person may have been moving his or her features, but which in any event may not always provide a safe impression of what that person really looks like when seen in the flesh. ( 
       R v Constantine Carusi 
        (CCA 17 January 1997) at 23 
       ) The judge did refer to the time which had elapsed before Mrs Smith looked at the photographs, and this was an important circumstance for the jury to consider. He also gave a direction apparently intended to overcome the “rogues gallery” effect of the use of photographs. ( 
       Alexander v The Queen 
        at 409) 
        But that is all. I do not intend to suggest that a summing up will be deficient unless  
       all 
        of the earlier matters are referred to. It is the absence in this case of any reference to  
       any 
        of them which renders this summing up seriously deficient.” 
        
       
      
    61   These observations were, however, made in the context of an eyewitness who had been asked to make an identification from photographs, that was reliant upon her memory, and in the context of a direction in which there were several obvious deficiencies. His Honour made it clear that he did not suggest that “a summing up will be deficient unless all of the” matters identified are referred to.  
    62   Each case must depend upon its own facts. It would be reading too much into this passage to elevate it to a universal formula. In the present case, the jury were informed that the fact that “photographs are a poor substitute for the real thing, (for) seeing someone in the flesh”; and were instructed that, if they had been at Waverton and had seen the person photographed, that would have been a “more satisfactory way of making a comparison”. They were also told they needed to take into account “the quality of the photographs and their definition”. This was, to my mind, a perfectly adequate explanation of the difference between a two dimensional picture, and a three dimensional person in the flesh, and a reminder of the need to be careful so far as the image in the photograph may not have been particularly distinct. The fact that the man in the photograph was wearing a hat was clearly apparent to them from the comparison exercise. Moreover they were reminded more than once of the need for the prosecution to prove its case and to do so beyond reasonable doubt . 
    63   I am, accordingly, not persuaded that there was an insufficiency of explanation as to the need for caution, a need that was expressed more than once, and in explicit terms. I am strengthened in that conclusion by the circumstances that this was a case where the jury had the benefit of a number of photographs, as well as of the videos; and that the comparisons invited were not confined to the facial features of the appellant, but went also to items of clothing and the like, admittedly his, that were remarkably similar to those that were observed by the eyewitnesses, and apparent in the photographs. 
    64   Additionally, the jury had the benefit of a surveillance photograph proximate to the time of the offence, and of physical descriptions of the second offender which appear to have tallied, generally, with the appearance of the appellant. 
    65   The case was therefore not one of simple comparison of the facial features of the appellant as he appeared in the witness box with the photographs, although that remained an important part of the exercise required of the jury. 
    66   The submission that the caution and explanation for it should have had been given at the time of the exercise, and not left until the summing up, needs to be considered in the light of the circumstances that: 
     
      
     a) there was no request for any such caution or explanation while the evidence was being led; 
      
      
     b) the trial was a short trial occupying less than four days, and the summing up was given on the day following the cross examination in question; 
      
      
     c) as the trial revolved upon the single issue whether the appellant was the second offender at the scene of the two robberies, and as the evidence led went almost wholly to that issue, involving either eyewitness descriptions of that person’s appearance, the tender of videos or stills, or of clothing that the Crown contended matched the descriptions given by the witnesses as well as the images captured in the videos or stills, there was no particular point during the trial at which the warning might best have been given. 
      
    67   In those circumstances, I am unable to accept the submission that, by the time of the summing up, the jurors would have already made up their minds as to the connection, and that the caution was therefore too late. This submission gives insufficient credit to the common sense and intelligence of the jury, which can be assumed to have accepted the directions given, and to have complied with them. 
    68   There are cases where it is appropriate to give directions or warnings in the course of a trial, particularly where there is a risk that the jury might attach to a piece of evidence a significance that it does not deserve, or where the use to which it can be put is limited, or where it is applicable to only one accused. That is especially so in the case of a lengthy or complex trial where there is a risk of the caution being lost, or overlooked unless linked to the evidence at the time it was led. The present is not such a case, having regard to the fact that the exercise in question occurred at the very end of the trial, and was followed promptly by the summing up. 
    69   I am not persuaded that any arguable point or risk of a miscarriage of justice arises in respect of this ground, and I would refuse leave under rule 4. In particular, I am unable to see that any identifiable chance of an acquittal was lost by reference to the matters raised under this ground, let alone a real chance of acquittal: Storey (1978) 140 CLR 360 at 376. The prosecution case was in my view compelling, given the association shown between the two accused, and the photographic evidence linking the appellant with the man in the Akubra hat and with the other items of clothing and tools found at his house. 
     
      
     Ground 3 - cross examination of the appellant concerning the possible alibi evidence 
      
      
    70   When, in the course of the ERISP, the appellant was asked about his whereabouts on the evening of 22 July and 28 July he suggested that probably he was at home (see his answers to questions 87,147, 180 and 181). In relation to the second night, he said that his de facto and a teenage girl Jenny Mapp, would also have been at home (answers to questions 184, 202 and 209). No alibi notice was given, and in chief the appellant did not give any evidence as to his whereabouts on the nights of the two robberies. The ERISP was, however, before the jury and to the extent noted it provided some support for the defence case. 
    71   In the course of the cross examination, the appellant was questioned in relation to the answers mentioned, and in the course of that examination he confirmed his belief that he would probably have been home at the relevant times, and that his wife would have been there with him. It was at that point that he was asked whether his wife was “coming along to give evidence?”, to which the answer was “No”. 
    72   The Crown Prosecutor pursued this topic by asking the appellant whether he had discussed that matter with his de facto wife after his arrest: 
     
      
       
       “Q. I suppose at the first opportunity you said to your wife, “Look, I couldn’t have done this because I was home with you”? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Well, is that what you asked her? A. Yes, well, she believed that I was home with her, yes.” 
       
      
      
       
       Q. So you did ask her, “Tuesday 22 July, do you remember me being at home with you all night?” A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. “And the following Monday the 28th July, do you remember me being at home with you all night?”? A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Did you ask her that? A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. What did she say? A. Well, she was 90 per cent sure that I was, that I would have been home. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Is she coming along to tell the members of the jury that today? A. No she is at work.” 
       
      
    73   The cross examination then turned to the other potential alibi witness, (Jenny Mapp). It proceeded as follows: 
     
      
       
       “Q. And she, (Jenny Mapp), would have been at home? A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And she would have been able to say you were at home? A. Yes, I would think so. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Did you ask her after you were charged by the police, “Look, do you remember me being at home on these nights?”? A. Well, it was quite some time before I actually got to speak to her. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Did you eventually ask her? A. Well, I made her aware that the police wanted to ask her if she could confirm it. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And she couldn’t confirm it, could she? A. I am not sure. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Is she coming along today to give evidence? A. No. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. That she was at home? A. No. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Why not? A. I am not sure. I haven’t seen her. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Have you asked her? A. well she is back in Melbourne at the moment. 
       
      
    74   The Crown Prosecutor returned briefly to the appellant’s wife: 
     
      
       
       Q. Did you ask your wife would she come along and give that evidence? A. yes, but I - I spoke to my wife about it but she said she could only 90 per cent say that I would normally be home at that time. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. She wasn’t prepared to come along and say 90 per cent even? A. Well, I guess if I would have pushed the issue.” 
       
      
    75   At the close of the cross examination the Crown Prosecutor came back to this matter: 
     
      
       
       “Q. You deny it is you in either of those photographs, you didn’t do these robberies? A. I didn’t do these robberies, no. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You can’t tell the jury where you were? A. I would say I would have been at home. I can’t recall hundred percent so but normally on a weekday, I would be home. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. No-one is coming along to court to support the fact that you were at home? A. No, there is only my de facto and my children are too young obviously. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Do you still life with your wife? A. Yes.” 
       
      
    76   There was no objection to any of this cross examination, but in re-examination the appellant’s counsel established that his wife had provided a statement to police that tended to corroborate the answers which he had given to the Crown Prosecutor. The re-examination concerning that statement, and the reason for her absence from the witness box, proceeded as follows: 
     
      
       
       “Q. She says (in her statement): 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         “I am not aware of the dates which the two robberies occurred. I haven’t got a clue of these dates so I cannot positively say where Kevin was on these nights. What I can say is that Kevin and I normally don’t go out, particularly during the evening. As I said before, I am normally the last person to go to bed.” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       That is your wife’s recollection of events, isn’t it? A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And in discussions with my solicitor, because of her answer to the police officer in relation to these matters, you know that is the reason she is not being called, isn’t it? A. yes.” 
       
      
    77   The trial judge obviously entertained some concern as to the manner in which the prosecution sought to use this evidence, by drawing attention to S 20 of the Evidence Act. That Section provides: 
     
      
       
       “S 20(3) The judge or any party (other than the prosecutor) may comment on a failure to give evidence by a person who, at the time of the failure, was: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) the defendant’s spouse or de facto spouse, or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) a parent or child of the defendant. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (4) However, unless the comment is made by another defendant in the proceeding, a comment of a kind referred to in subsection (3) must not suggest that the spouse, de facto spouse, parent or child failed to give evidence because: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) the defendant was guilty of the offence concerned, or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) the spouse, de facto spouse, parent or child believed that the defendant was guilty of the offence concerned.” 
         
        
       
      
    78   In reply, the Crown Prosecutor made it clear that she would not make any comment in her address, but asked for a Jones v Dunkel direction to be given by his Honour in the summing up. 
    79   In the result, his Honour did not give a Jones v Dunkel direction, and there was no mention in the summing up of the evidence that had been given by the appellant concerning his whereabouts on the nights of the two robberies, or of the absence of any witness capable of providing him with an alibi. 
    80   It was submitted that nevertheless, the trial miscarried because of the cross examination, and the implicit criticism, which it carried, of the appellant’s failure to call the two witnesses and of his credibility. Reliance was, in this regard, placed upon the observations of Gaudron ACJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ, in RPS 74 ALJR 449. 
     
      
       
       “In a criminal trial not only is an accused person not bound to give evidence, it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The observations by the court in  
       Jones v Dunkel 
        must not be applied in criminal cases without taking account of those considerations. 
       
      
      
       
       If the question concerns the calling by the defence of a witness other than the accused, it will also be necessary to recall that the prosecutor “has the responsibility of ensuring that the Crown case is presented with fairness to the accused” and in many cases would be expected to call the witness in question as part of the case for the prosecution. And, if the question concerns the failure of the prosecution to call a witness whom it might have been expected to call, the issue is not whether the jury may properly reach conclusions about issues of fact but whether, in the circumstances, the jury should entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused.” 
       
      
    81   In the same case, Callinan J, said: 
     
      
       
       “The possible application of  
       Jones v Dunkel 
        to criminal cases requires consideration. In  
       R v OGD 
       , whilst accepting that there are obvious difficulties in some criminal cases in applying that case, and in giving directions to juries in accordance with it, the Court of Criminal Appeal said that a trial judge may nonetheless do so in an appropriate case. 
       
      
      
       
       There is no doubt that a direction in accordance with  
       Jones v Dunkel 
        may be given in respect of a failure by the Crown to call a material witness without acceptable and admissible explanation. The need for such a direction will usually be heightened by the Crown’s responsibility to present its case in a way which is fair to an accused. However such a direction may not be given in relation to an accused person or an accused person’s witnesses who, if the matter were a civil trial might be expected to be called. A direction with respect to a defence case, based upon  
       Jones v Dunkel 
        would not only infringe Section 20(2) but also would erode the basic principle of the presumption of innocence. The principles stated in  
       Jones v Dunkel  
       by their very nature presuppose that there is a need, or an occasion, for evidence to be called by a party, or an expectation that evidence could and should be called by a party. An accused person in criminal proceedings labours under no such need, occasion or expectation.” (paras 110,111) 
       
      
    82   It was perfectly proper, if not obligatory, by reason of Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 The Reports 67 and the ERISP, for the Prosecutor to cross examine the appellant as to his whereabouts at the time of the robberies and to suggest that he was the second man on each occasion. However, I have reached the conclusion that the remainder of the cross examination, so far as it established that neither the de facto wife, or Jenny Mapp, were going to give evidence, was inappropriate. 
    83   First, it was the case that no alibi notice had been given, nor had alibi evidence been called. The possibility of an alibi had been hinted at in the police interview, but that was as far as it went. Absent a proper basis for seeking to establish a false alibi, of the kind that may have provided a strand in a circumstantial case, there was no real basis for the Crown ventilating whether or not the defence proposed to call evidence as to the appellant’s whereabouts on the nights of the robberies. 
    84   No request had been made by the appellant for the prosecution to call his wife or Ms Mapp, in accordance with the decision in Apostilides (1984) 154 CLR 563. Had the Crown wished to call these witnesses, of its own volition, it could have run into a potential problem, by reason of S 18(2) of the Evidence Act which provides: 
     
      
       
       “(2) A person who, when required to give evidence, is the spouse, de facto spouse, parent or child of a defendant may object to being required” 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) to give evidence, or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) to give evidence of a communication between the person and the defendant,  
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         as a witness for the prosecution”. 
         
        
       
      
    85   Given the qualified and uncertain answer which the Crown knew the wife had given to police concerning the whereabouts of the appellant, it is unlikely that it could have obtained an order in accordance with S 18(6) and (7) compelling her evidence. 
    86   As events turned out, the defence were able, in re-examination, to place before the jury the contents of the wife’s statement and an explanation for her absence. Although hedged by a degree of uncertainty, if anything, the statement tended to assist the appellant. Additionally, it provided an explanation for the absence of Ms Mapp that, it may be assumed, would have been regarded by the jury as reasonable, particularly as nothing more was made of this aspect of the case by the Crown Prosecutor or by the trial judge. 
    87   Although I would regard the cross examination in question as having been inappropriate, I am not persuaded in the particular circumstances of the case, that it involved any unfairness to the appellant, or that there was any tangible risk of a miscarriage of justice associated with it. Rather, it was a matter that, in the atmosphere of the trial, was considered to be unimportant and not a matter that operated to the potential disadvantage of the appellant: Saffron (1988) 17 NSWLR 395 at 434. Since there was no objection to the cross examination Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. I would grant leave to argue this ground, but would not be satisfied that it was made good. 
     
      
     SENTENCE 
      
    88   The appellant also sought leave to appeal against the severity of the concurrent sentences which provided for a period of imprisonment for 7 years and 6 months added to the 8 months pre trial custody, and to an additional term of 3 years and 2 months. 
    89   It was submitted that the sentences were too severe for offences of the kind before the Court, and that special circumstances should have been found. 
    90   I do not consider that either submission has been made good. There were a number of circumstances aggravating the objective criminality involved in the two offences: 
     
      
     a) on each occasion firearms were used, a matter of some significance in an assessment of the appellant’s criminality:  
     Readman 
      (1990) 47 A Crim R 181; 
      
      
     b) there were two separate offences, committed a week apart, so that they could not be regarded as part of the same criminal enterprise; 
      
      
     c) both offences involved a good degree of premeditation, and planning; 
      
      
     d) both offences were carried out in company, again a circumstance escalating the criminality involved:  
     Kenny Li 
      NSWCCA 9 July 1997; 
      
      
     e) the victims were vulnerable staff of the State Rail Authority, providing a service for the public at night; 
      
      
     f) the amounts taken were not small; 
      
      
     g) for the victims of each robbery the experience could not have been otherwise than terrifying. 
      
    91   Subjectively, the appellant’s position was not favourable, for the following reasons: 
     
      
     a) he had an extensive criminal history dating back to 1985, comprising convictions relating to offences involving the use of drugs, stealing, goods in custody, false pretences, break enter and steal, malicious damage, possession of implements, steal from dwelling and the like, dealt with in the Local Court, mainly by fines and recognisances, but also by a number of custodial sentences; 
      
      
     b) at the time of the offences he was subject to two recognisances to be of good behaviour - a matter that escalated his objective criminality:  
     Doridis 
      NSWCCA 18 December 1986 and  
     Jerrard 
      (1991) 56 ACrimR 297; 
      
      
     c) he was not entitled to the benefit of a plea of guilty, and had shown no contrition for the offences; 
      
      
     d) he was not a young offender. 
      
    92   In the circumstances, the case was distinguishable in material respects from the factual circumstances postulated for the guideline judgment in Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, per Spigelman J at 380, involving: 
     
      
       
        (i) a young offender with no or little criminal history; 
       
      
      
       
       (ii) a weapon like a knife capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; 
       
      
      
       
       (iii) a limited degree of planning; 
       
      
      
       
       (iv) limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof; 
       
      
      
       
       (v) victims in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver; 
       
      
      
       
       (vi) small amount taken; and 
       
      
      
       
       (vii) a guilty plea. 
       
      
      
     For such cases a range of between 4 and 5 years for the full term was held to be appropriate. However, as Spigelman CJ pointed out: 
      
      
       
       “Aggravating and mitigating factors will justify a sentence below or above the range as this Court’s prior decisions indicate. The narrow range is a starting point.” 
       
      
    93   The stern stance which this Court expects trial Judges to take in relation to extremely serious armed robberies, into which category I would place the present offences (as did the learned sentencing Judge) has been adequately expressed in decisions such as Broxam NSWCCA 3 April 1986; Roberts (1994) 73 ACrimR 306; Waldron NSWCCA 3 March 1994; and Samuela Antonio [2000] NSWCCA 266. Staff working at night for public utilities such as the State Rail Authority are particularly vulnerable to this form of offence. As such they are entitled to be protected from the activities of gun wielding robbers, and those who choose to venture into such line of activity must expect to receive sentences that carry with them a strong element of general as well as of personal deterrence. 
    94   The fact that the appellant may have had something of a drug problem provided no excuse for his offences. His Honour expressly took into account the fact that he had made a serious attempt to deal with that problem while in custody, and that his imprisonment was likely to cause some hardship to his family. He did not, however, consider that special circumstances had been shown save so far as the period of pre-trial custody justified a variation in the usual proportion between the minimum and additional terms.  
    95   I can see no error in that conclusion, having regard to the age of the appellant, his prior record and the other unfavourable subjective matters identified. In particular, the hardship to his family did not constitute that degree of exceptional hardship as to qualify for a reduction in the overall sentence, or for a readjustment of the manner in which it should be served: T (1990) 47 ACrimR 29 and Boyle (1987) 34 ACrimR 202. 
    96   The sentences were not, in my view, outside the legitimate sentencing range for the serious offences involved, when compared with decisions of this Court such as Bell NSWCCA 11 May 1993. No occasion has been shown for disturbing the findings as to the absence of special circumstances. Accordingly, I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
     1. Appeals against conviction dismissed. 
      
      
     2. Applications for leave to appeal against sentence granted, but appeals dismissed. 
      
      
     3. Convictions and sentences below confirmed. 
      
      
    97   O’KEEFE J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
    1    STEIN JA:  
     
     Introduction 
      
    2    The appellant, DH, was indicted on 8 February 1999 before his Honour Acting Judge Nader in the District Court at Dubbo on four counts of having homosexual intercourse with a male person above the age of 10 years and under the age of 18 years, to wit 15 years, (s 78N Crimes Act 1900). I will refer to the complainant, who is the son of the appellant, as DHJ. 
    3    The first count alleged that between 8 November 1994 and 20 March 1995 at Parkes the appellant, being the father of DHJ, had homosexual intercourse with DHJ, then being about 15 years. 
    4    The second and third counts alleged acts of homosexual intercourse with DHJ between 21 March 1995 and 16 April 1995 at Forbes. 
    5    The fourth count alleged that the appellant had homosexual intercourse with DHJ on 3 May 1995 at Forbes. 
    6    The appellant pleaded not guilty and was tried before his Honour and a jury of twelve. On 10 February 1999 the jury returned verdicts of not guilty by direction of his Honour on counts 2 and 3. On 11 February 1999 the jury returned verdicts of guilty on counts 1 and 4. The appellant was sentenced on 12 February 1999 to 8 years penal servitude, comprising a minimum term of 6 years and an additional term of 2 years. 
     
      
     The Crown case 
      
    7    Briefly summarised the Crown case was that the complainant was born on 21 January 1980 and aged 15 at the time of the alleged offences. The complainant lived in various rural locations in Narromine, Parkes and Forbes with his family. In Parkes and Forbes he later lived alone with his father, the appellant. 
    8    The complainant’s first recollection of sexual contact with his father was when he was about 5 years of age at Narromine. Subsequently, there was sexual contact on too many occasions for him to be able to count. The complainant described an incident where the appellant had given him a white tablet which induced drowsiness. The complainant said that the appellant subsequently put his penis into his anus and made him do the same to the appellant. This was accompanied by a threat with a knife. The incident was said to have occurred at the Bushman’s Caravan Park at Parkes about 3 months before the events the subject of count 1. 
    9    Between 8 November 1994 and 20 March 1995 the complainant was living in a caravan with the appellant at Bushman’s Caravan Park. The appellant had become friends with Gordon Scott, another resident. Gordon had a son, Sean, and the complainant and he spent time together while the appellant and Gordon socialised and drank together. On the day in question the complainant had been discharged from hospital with a new plaster on his broken arm. It was also Gordon Scott’s birthday. The appellant went to Gordon’s caravan for a drink, while the complainant and Sean watched television in the appellant’s caravan. After a while Sean returned to his caravan and the appellant returned to the van to get more beer. The complainant was playing chequers. According to the complainant the appellant was drunk. The appellant proposed that he play. He proposed that if the complainant won, the complainant would have ‘to pork him’. If the appellant won, the complainant would have to suck the appellant’s penis. The appellant won and told the complainant ‘now you’ve got to give me a head job’. The complainant then placed his mouth over the appellant’s penis. In cross-examination the complainant maintained that the appellant also had penile anal intercourse with him. 
    10    On 3 May 1995 the complainant was released from hospital with his broken leg in a heel to knee plaster. He and the appellant were then living in an old farmhouse at Cotton’s Weir, near Forbes. He went home by taxi. He had been home about an hour or so when the appellant came in from outside. There was an argument about money. The appellant said ‘if you don’t give me what I want I’m going to bash the crap out of you’. The appellant than grabbed the complainant and put him down on the floor, ripped his shorts off and put his penis into the complainant’s anus. The complainant went to the toilet and noticed some drops of blood from his anus. He then obtained some clothes. The altercation with the appellant continued culminating in the appellant throwing the complainant through a window. 
    11    The complainant took off down the road to Cotton’s Weir where he stayed for 30 minutes, then he went to a telephone box and telephoned Sue McGrory, an older friend. She drove and picked him up and the two of them went to the house of Lynne Schaeffer. Ms Schaeffer was an ex-girlfriend of the appellant. While they were at the house there was a loud noise outside. Fearing it was his father, the complainant hid on the floor. Ms McGrory said to the complainant that she could not help him unless he said what had happened. The complainant told her that ‘my old man had sexual intercourse’ with him and told her how they had ‘done it and everything’. Ms McGrory’s version of the complaint was generally consistent with the complainant’s account, albeit more explicit. 
    12    The complainant stayed with Ms McGrory for some time and she accompanied him to the Grenfell police station to make a statement. On 5 June 1995 the complainant was examined by Dr Larcombe. On examination she found that the complainant’s anus revealed a 4 mm gap and there was laxity of the anal sphincter. This meant that normal muscle tone was decreased. Her observations were consistent with the history given by the complainant of the appellant having anal intercourse with him, that it had been painful and that he had bled.13    The complainant was very slight for his age, and, according to Dr Larcombe, did not appear to have gone through puberty. By the time of the trial he was 19 years and had grown appreciably taller and filled out physically. 
    14    Mr Boness was the proprietor of the Bushman’s Caravan Park at Parkes. He produced the park records which recorded that the appellant lived there from July 1994 to 20 March 1995. The records also showed that Gordon Scott lived there from July 1994 until 19 January 1995. This would have the effect of narrowing the range of dates in the first count. 
    15    Statements were also admitted into evidence before the jury that the complainant had been in the Manning Base Hospital between 3 and 8 November 1994 and the Forbes District Hospital from 29 April 1995 until his discharge on 3 May 1995. 
    16    Gordon Scott could not be traced and Lynne Schaeffer did not wish to give evidence or assist police in their inquiries. 
     
      
     The appellant’s case 
      
    17    The appellant’s case was one of denial of all of the allegations made by the complainant. He gave evidence to this effect. While he agreed that he could have been a better father and had been neglectful of the complainant, he had never sexually molested him. He agreed that he had become intoxicated on the day of Gordon Scott’s birthday and returned to the van for more beer but denied having anal intercourse with the complainant. 
    18    The appellant also denied the allegation of the complainant of 3 May 1995, including denying that he threw his son through the window. The appellant also denied the complainant’s allegation of sexual assaults not the subject of the counts in the indictment. 
     
      
     The grounds of appeal 
      
    19    The grounds of appeal are as follows: 
     
      
     1. His Honour erred in directing the jury about the manner in which they might use evidence of sexual conduct other than that charged. 
      
      
     2. His Honour erred in failing adequately to direct the jury about the significance of delay in complaint. 
      
      
     3. His Honour erred in suggesting that the evidence of Sue McGrory might be capable of corroborating the complainant’s evidence. 
      
      
     4. The verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 
      
      
     5. (a) His Honour failed to sum up the evidence at all and failed to relate the 
      
      elements of the offences to the facts in the case, and 
      
      
      (b) the trial miscarried in that the act of sexual intercourse relied on in relation to each of counts 1 and 4 was not identified by the prosecution or his Honour, and the case was left to the jury on the basis that in respect of each count there was both an act of anal intercourse and an act of oral intercourse. 
      
    20    All of the grounds, bar ground 4, require leave of the Court since no objection was taken at the trial. 
     
      
     The trial 
      
    21    The trial commenced on 8 February 1999. The Crown opened to the jury outlining acts of anal intercourse with respect to each of the 4 counts in the indictment. 
    22    After the Crown’s opening and in the absence of the jury, the prosecutor indicated that he proposed to seek to adduce evidence from the complainant of acts other than those charged in the indictments. The purpose was to show the context of the relationship between the complainant and the accused and also that the appellant had a tendency to act in the way it was alleged he did on the four occasions charged. The leading of relationship evidence was not opposed by counsel for the accused, although its use as tendency evidence was opposed. While it is unclear what ruling his Honour made, it may be assumed that the evidence was admitted to show the relationship between the parties but not guilty passion, since the latter was not referred to in the summing-up nor, one may assume, in counsels’ closing addresses to the jury. 
    23    The complainant then commenced to give his evidence before the jury. He recounted how when he was 15 years and living with his father at the Bushman’s Caravan Park at Parkes, he returned from hospital with a new plaster on his broken arm. It was Gordon Scott’s birthday and the complainant and Sean, Gordon’s son, were watching television in the appellant’s caravan while the appellant and Gordon were drinking in Gordon’s van. Sean went home and the appellant returned to his van for more beer. The complainant was playing chequers by himself. The appellant wanted to play and proposed that if the complainant won, he would ‘pork’ him and if the appellant won, the complainant would have to give him a ‘head job’. According to the complainant, his father was drunk. The appellant won and the complainant sucked the appellant’s penis. The appellant grabbed the beer and left. 
    24    The complainant said that this was not the first occasion of sexual contact with his father. The first time was when he was 5 years of age and living at Narromine, his father played with his penis. Between 1985 and 1995 there were too many occasions of sexual contact with the appellant to count. 
    25    The complainant recounted one occasion when the appellant had given him a white tablet which made him drowsy and sick. He said that the appellant was ‘playing’ with him and he had ended up with the appellant having anal intercourse with him as well as vice versa. On this occasion, the appellant threatened him with a knife if he did not comply. The complainant told the appellant not to do it and to stop because it hurt. 
    26    At this point in the trial his Honour gave an opening address to the jury concerning their role. In this address his Honour explained the concept of proof beyond reasonable doubt. 
    27    The complainant then resumed his evidence in chief. He gave evidence concerning what occurred on 3 May 1995 at the farmhouse near Cotton’s Weir, Forbes where he was living with his father. This concerned count 4 in the indictment. The complainant had been released from hospital with his broken leg in a plaster. The plaster was from the heel of his foot to just beneath his knee.28    The complainant was by himself in the house playing Gameboy. The appellant came in from outside where he had been watering. There was an argument about money and the appellant threatened the complainant that if he didn’t give him what he wanted he was ‘going to bash the crap out of you’. The appellant then grabbed his son and put him on the floor. 
    29    The appellant than had penile anal intercourse with the complainant. The complainant went to the toilet and started bleeding. He then went to get his clothes and the appellant picked him up and threw him through the lounge room window. 
    30    The complainant took off down the road to Cotton’s Weir where he stayed for one half hour. He then telephoned his friend, Sue McGrory. She came and picked the complainant up and they went to Lynne Schaeffer’s house in Forbes. Lynne was the appellant’s ex-girlfriend. While the complainant was there he heard a big noise outside. He looked outside and heard another big bang. The complainant then hid on the floor because he thought it might be his father, of whom he was scared. Later that evening he told Sue and Lynne that his father had sexually assaulted him. He said that Sue had said to him that she couldn’t help him unless he told what had happened. He said that ‘my old man had sexual intercourse’ and that he told Sue how ‘we done it and everything’. He had not told anyone of the events before because he was scared. 
    31    At the close of the complainant’s evidence in chief it was apparent that the complainant had alleged only oral intercourse re count 1, had given no evidence supportive of counts 2 and 3 and had complained of anal intercourse regarding count 4. 
    32    Defence counsel cross-examined the complainant at some length. The thrust of the examination was to expose inconsistencies between the complainant’s evidence in chief and statements made to police. For example, counsel referred to an allegation the complainant had made about the appellant sexually assaulting him in a flat above the Copperart Shop at Parkes. The complainant was unwilling to give this evidence saying that he had not wanted to come to court in the first place and only came to tell about ‘the four main ones’. 
    33    A voir dire examination of the complainant ensued which ended in his Honour adjourning the trial to the next day so that the complainant could be provided with independent legal advice. This apparently occurred and cross-examination of the complainant resumed on 9 February 1999. He then gave evidence of the appellant having anal intercourse with him at the Copperart flat in Parkes. He had not told the police of this. He was asked whether the homosexual intercourse that the appellant had had with him above the Copperart shop was the same sort of sexual intercourse that the appellant was on trial for and he answered ‘yes’.  
    34    The complainant was cross-examined about the chequers incident on Gordon Scott’s birthday. He said that he had told Detective Marsh that his father had had anal intercourse with him on that occasion. Further, that he had noticed drops of blood from his anus when going to the toilet after being sexually assaulted. He said that it had made him cry.  
    35    The complainant was also cross-examined about the incident at the farmhouse on 3 May 1995. This included evidence of forced anal intercourse by the appellant of the complainant while his leg was in plaster. The cross-examination was descriptive of a violent sexual assault and fight culminating in the appellant sucking the complainant’s penis and the complainant urinating. This resulted in the appellant punching the complainant in the head, picking him up and throwing him through the window. 
    36    Dr Dianne Larcombe was interposed and gave evidence of her examination of the complainant on 5 June 1995, one month after the alleged offence in count 4. She noted complaints by DHJ of anal intercourse by the father and of a small amount of bleeding from his anus. On examination she found a 4mm diameter gap in the anus. There was laxity in the anal sphincter which meant that normal muscle tone was decreased. This could be consistent with the complaint made. Laxity was caused by forced dilation. The forcing open of the anus caused stretching and the laxity could be caused by the insertion of a penis. The doctor expected that it would have been on more than one occasion to fit with her finding of a 4mm gap on examination. 
    37    Dr Larcombe also noted that the complainant, when examined, appeared younger than his age and was quite slight. He had no body hair or pubic hair and appeared to be in the early stages of puberty. His left leg was in plaster. In cross-examination she agreed that there was no scarring around the anus nor recent lesion. 
    38    Significantly she was asked whether there could be other reasons (that is, other than forced sexual penetration) for the laxity of the anal sphincter. She answered that it was possible but that she could not think of any other reason. She was asked whether chronic constipation could produce laxity. She said that it was possible but ‘not likely’. She was pressed as to whether anal penetration was the only possible cause of the laxity. She answered that she did not use the word ‘only’ very often. However, she said that it was ‘fairly probable’ that it was the cause. 
    39    The complainant’s cross-examination then resumed to completion. In re-examination the complainant confirmed that on Gordon’s birthday the appellant had had intercourse with him and also on 3 May 1995 after he had been discharged from hospital.  
    40    Ms McGrory gave evidence that when she picked the complainant up on 3 May 1995 he was agitated and distressed. When there was a big bang outside Lynne’s house the complainant hid under the table saying that he was not going home. He was hysterical and crying. He complained to her of the appellant ‘porking him up the arse’. He told her that the first time it had happened was when he was 6 years old at Narromine.  
    41    It was during Ms McGrory’s evidence that his Honour raised with counsel whether or not he should sum up the facts. He said: 
     
      
       
       The summarising of the evidence is in some cases optional to the Judge and quite frequently with the consent of counsel and on one occasion with the approval of the Court of Criminal Appeal I have not summed up the facts of the case by way of any sort of summary of the facts.  
       
      
      
       
       The facts of this case notwithstanding that it is a lengthy case for other reasons, don’t come into a - they’re not wired in complicated facts as they might be in say a fraud case for example and it occurs to me it might suit counsel better - I don’t want an immediate response but I want you to think about it, if you, in your own addresses to the jury, deal with all of the facts which you wish the jury to consider in support of your respective cases, all of the evidence I mean, when I say all of the facts, and that I don’t run the risk of detracting from that by trying to do some fairly superficial summary of the facts. Would you consider that and in due course tell me whether you, for some reason particularly want me to attempt a summary of the facts as well.  
       
      
    42    His Honour referred to s 405AA of the Crimes Act and added: 
     
      
       
       Do you think that it may be an appropriate case for the application of that section? The section provides that “a Judge of the Supreme Court or District Court need not summarise at the end of a criminal trial before a jury the evidence given in the trial if the Judge is of the opinion that in all the circumstances of the trial the summary is not necessary”. 
       
      
      
       
       That would be so if you gentlemen deal with the evidence yourselves to the extent that satisfies you that the jury are fully aware of what your cases are. After all, it’s not the moral authority of the judge that’s needed in summarising the facts. The moral authority of the judge as they call it, is required to emphasise generally rules of law and the way they should consider the evidence. I’m certainly not going to withdraw from that.  
       
      
    43    Neither the prosecutor nor the appellant’s counsel objected, indeed to the contrary. 
    44    At the end of the Crown case an application was made by defence counsel for directed verdicts of not guilty on counts 2 and 3. The prosecutor agreed with the submission and his Honour directed verdicts of not guilty on these counts. That left before the jury only counts 1 and 4. The appellant then gave evidence which denied the charges and denied any sexual molestation of the complainant. 
    45    On the morning of the fourth day of the trial (11 February 1999) the defence closed its case. Before the prosecutor commenced his address to the jury the trial judge again raised the question of his not summing-up on the facts. His Honour said that a lot of the evidence was in the nature of a narrative and he could not be expected to repeat it all to the jury.  
    46    His Honour said that if there was aspects of the evidence relied on, it was counsel’s duty to point it out to the jury. The judge noted the difficulty produced by the absence of transcript, especially of the cross-examination of the complainant. He also referred to witnesses mumbling and speaking quickly making note taking almost impossible. 
    47    The Crown prosecutor then addressed the jury. In the absence of the jury his Honour asked the prosecutor what sort of intercourse was the first count. The prosecutor responded ‘penis and anus’. His Honour referred to the evidence of the complainant in-chief to a ‘head job’. The prosecutor reminded his Honour that the Crown had opened to the jury on anal intercourse and that is what the complainant had said in chief. This was incorrect. The complainant’s evidence in chief had not been of anal intercourse. The exchange between the bench and bar then continued with the prosecutor saying: 
     
      
       
       But your Honour he is then cross-examined in relation to that count [Count 1] and he detailed how it was that the accused had had anal intercourse.  
       
      
    48    The prosecutor said that in opening to the jury he had put the Crown case of an act of anal intercourse and, by the time the complainant’s cross-examination was completed, he had given evidence of this act. 
    49    It is noteworthy that defence counsel made no protest or response to this exchange between the bench and the prosecutor. 
    50    His Honour reiterated that he was not going to summarise the facts to the jury. He noted that two of the witnesses were almost inarticulate and spoke rapidly. This was clearly a reference to the complainant and the appellant. Both the prosecutor and counsel for the appellant indicated that they were content with the judge’s decision. 
    51    Defence counsel then addressed the jury. In the transcript before us, and immediately after reference to his address, the following note appears: ‘Counsel in agreeance that the evidence has been canvassed sufficiently before the jury to not require his Honour to summarise it to the jury’. 
    52    His Honour then summed-up. He gave standard directions on deciding the case only on the evidence before the Court and as to how evidence could be evaluated. 
    53    His Honour referred to a ‘special’ matter which was that the complainant’s evidence was uncorroborated. He said that his evidence was ‘not supported, in its material respects, in its important respects, by the evidence of any independent witnesses or any other independent fact’. He gave an example of corroboration and said that that sort of evidence did not exist in the case. He directed the jury that: 
     
      
       
       It is dangerous to convict on such evidence unless you carefully scrutinise it, carefully consider it, critically look at it - I do not mean “critically” in that nasty sense of the word but “critically” in the sense of analysing it carefully and thinking about it, very carefully. And having done that, satisfied yourself that you can rely upon it. If you do that, if you carefully do that but conscientiously do that and if at the end of that exercise you - each one of you - says to yourself “Yes, I think notwithstanding that the evidence is uncorroborated and having looked at it so carefully I am still satisfied that I can rely on it” then you can act on it, but I am required because of the experience of the courts over many years, to point out that uncorroborated evidence in a situation like this one, has to be looked at in that very particular way, with that scrutiny that I have mentioned.  
       
      
    54    His Honour then turned to the evidence of witnesses who may refer to ‘peripheral material’. He gave an example of such evidence. He said: 
     
      
       
       For example, Ms Susan Mary McGrory was called and she was called because she comes into the picture by reason of the fact that there was communication between the complainant and her at a particular time which you will no doubt well remember and some various times associated with that and the complainant gives evidence about that and Susan Mary McGrory gives evidence about that. Well, what you may find is that Susan Mary McGrory tends to corroborate some of those peripheral matters. You may not find that - I am not suggesting you should - but if you do, then you may find that they are mutually supporting pieces of evidence. 
       
      
    55    His Honour referred briefly to the evidence of Dr Larcombe and her evidence of the complainant’s ‘relaxed sphincter muscle’ and her opinion. He said that it was for the jury to evaluate her evidence and its bearing on the evidence of the complainant. 
    56    The summing-up then referred to the two counts in the indictment - counts 1 and 4. His Honour handed to the jury an aide memoir of the elements in each count. This was with the approval of counsel. The document is not available to this Court. His Honour made it plain that the ‘contentious’ element in the trial was the allegation that the appellant had homosexual intercourse with the complainant. His Honour had earlier referred to the definition to homosexual intercourse but he repeated it. He also referred to the dates of the alleged offences in each count. He told the jury that they had to ask themselves, as to the contentious element in each count, are we ‘satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had homosexual intercourse with the complainant?’. 
    57    His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
       … you have heard counsel tell you what evidence they rely upon. They have done so at length, they have done so very carefully. They have done so on the basis that I will not summarise the facts of the case to you again. I think there would be a real danger if I tried to do it, of detracting from the way counsel have put it to you.  
       
      
      
     and 
      
      
       
       … they have done that and they have done it very thoroughly and they have done so on the basis that I will not try to go over the facts again and I think this is the very kind of case where if I did try to do that, I might water down the force of what they have said individually to you and I am not going to do it. I simply remind you of this, that essentially what you have is a person complaining that certain things were done to him by the accused and he has given a narrative of that which has been elicited from him by questions asked by the Crown Prosecutor and he has been cross examined and very thoroughly and lengthily cross examined as you might think it is not an inappropriate thing for the counsel for the defence to do.  
       
      
    58    His Honour briefly referred to the evidence of the witnesses in the Crown case - the complainant, Dr Larcombe, Mr Boness, Ms McGrory, and Detective Marsh. Some witnesses’ evidence was dealt with in more detail then others. 
    59    The judge turned to the relationship evidence. With regard to this he said: 
     
      
       
       There has been some evidence given by the complainant of a general background of sexual assaults. He said that - I think I recall the expression when he said “there were too many to remember”. He said they started when he was 5 in his evidence. There is some evidence that he said elsewhere, when he was 7 or 8. You will consider those matters. Those alleged assaults are not the ones with which he has been charged and the only use you can make of those arises if you are satisfied that such assaults did take place and that you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they took place. If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that those other assaults took place, you may use them to assist you to understand the general nature of the relationship between the accused and his son. He is not charged with them but they may assist you to understand the way these 2 people related to one another because that may be a relevant factor in deciding the matters with which the accused has been charged. But you cannot consider them at all unless you are satisfied that such additional assaults committed over a greater period of time than that covered by the alleged charge assaults actually did occur. Of course they would have to have happened before the counts in the indictment if they happened at all and if you are satisfied that they did occur, you are allowed to consider them in helping you to understand the way in which the accused related to his son and vice versa.  
       
      
    60    His Honour referred to the evidence of ‘complaint’. He said that if count 4 actually occurred the complaint about it was made very soon after. His Honour directed the jury that the evidence of complaint had relevance to the credit or credibility of the complainant. He gave an example of how complaint or its absence could be used. Of this he said: 
     
      
       
       Now that can happen of course and it does not mean that the event did not occur but you can take it as something you take into account in relation to the credibility of the person because what you normally expect, if someone suffered such an assault as the one I have just described - I have deliberately made it a fairly extreme case - you would expect them virtually to tell the first person they saw almost out on the street “Help, I’ve just been raped”. And the fact of them complaining is admissible in evidence, not to prove that they have been raped, because that is not corroboration, because that emerges from the person herself or himself as I will explain to you later, corroboration has to come from another source, but it supports the credit of that person, the credibility of that person, the believability of that person and you might say if that person did come out of the park and immediately complain to someone or ran across the road to a shop and told someone or rang the police straight away that that was consistent with what she said happened and therefore that assists that person’s credibility. It does not corroborate what they said but it assists the person’s credibility. That person’s believability in the eyes of a jury and you are entitled to consider the complaint made to Mrs McGrory in relation to the fourth count in that way because it was a complaint made on the evidence, if you accept it. If you accept the evidence that it was made very soon afterwards, then you can treat it in that way, that is as supporting the credibility of the complainant. Mind you, that evidence was not uncritically accepted and there is a great deal of contest about it and you can only use it in that way if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that is what happened. If you have got a doubt about that then you just put it out of your mind. It does not support his credibility. But if you are satisfied that he did tell this lady as soon as reasonably expected afterwards, it does not have to be the exact minute that he sees her but if you think that it was done as soon as you would reasonably expect him to tell her in the circumstances, then you may treat it - you may treat it - as supporting his credibility in the case.  
        
       
      
    61    His Honour directed the jury to disregard the complaint evidence in relation to the first count because ‘it was made too long after the matter occurred to support his credibility’. What the complainant told Ms McGrory about earlier assaults was not a matter ‘which should support his credibility in your thinking’. [My emphasis added] 
    62    At the conclusion of the summing-up the prosecutor raised one matter and the defence two (one of which is immaterial). The prosecutor asked for a direction in accordance with s 405B of the Crimes Act in relation to the complaint. His Honour said that he would give such a discretion. Defence counsel sought that his Honour direct the jury that to convict they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each offence occurred on the dates alleged in the indictment. A reading of the transcript indicates that the prosecutor supported this request. The jury returned and his Honour gave them a s 405B direction, which included reading the provision to them. After giving the direction his Honour added: 
     
      
       
       You may take a different view. You may say “Oh, there was no complaint, therefore it did not happen, or it may not have happened” but I am required to give you that direction and to inform you that there may be good reasons why such a complaint is not made.  
       
      
    63    His Honour also directed the jury as to the importance of the dates alleged in the indictment making some reference to the evidence. At the conclusion of the summing-up neither counsel sought any further redirection. 
    64    Of particular importance in this appeal is that defence counsel made no objection to the summing-up in relation to alleged duplicity in the offences charged, the absence of summing-up on the facts, his Honour’s directions on how to use the relationship evidence, the absence of corroboration and the evidence of complaint. This raises the question of the application of rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. 
     
      
     Ground 5 - failure to sum-up on facts and duplicity 
      
    65    It is convenient to deal with this ground first and to consider the two limbs together. 
    66    The core of the submission of Ms Burgess on behalf of the appellant is that his Honour not only failed to summarise the facts, but failed to relate the directions of law which he gave to the evidence. Ms Burgess, who did not appear at the trial, submitted that s 405AA (now s 99 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1999) did not permit a trial judge to give the jury no guidance as to the way the evidence relates to the directions of law given. It did not relieve the trial judge of the obligation to sum up the respective cases made by the Crown and the accused, R v Condon (1995) 83 A Crim R 335 and R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91. 
    67    Counsel for the appellant is critical of his Honour for not directing the jury as to which act of sexual intercourse was relied on by the Crown in relation to each count, particularly given the confusion which she says is inherent in the evidence. There is, so Ms Burgess submits, a latent ambiguity in both charges in that what was left to the jury was two acts of sexual intercourse in relation to each count. She submits that it is not possible to know whether there was unanimity in the jury in respect to any one of the two acts disclosed in the evidence on both counts, R v Khouzame and Saliba [1999] NSWCCA 173, Walsh v Tattersall (1996) 188 CLR 77 and S v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 266. 
    68    In Zorad at 105 the Court said: 
     
      
       
       A summing-up should, in every case, not only include directions as to the ingredients of the offence which the Crown has to establish and an explanation of how the relevant law may be applied to the facts of the particular case, but it should also include a collected resume of the evidence which relates to  
       each  
       of those ingredients and a brief outline of the arguments which have been put in relation to that evidence.  
       
      
    69    Zorad involved an unrepresented accused person and was decided before the introduction of s 405AA. 
    70    In Domican v The Queen (1991 - 1992) 173 CLR 555 the High Court had occasion to refer to s 405AA. The joint judgment remarked that matters of fact, and the arguments in relation to them, were in a different category from directions on law. Citing R v Ali Ali (1981) 6 A Crim R 161, the Court said that a trial judge was not bound to discuss all of the evidence or analyse all the conflicts, and by itself, the failure to do so does not mean that there has been a miscarriage of justice. The Court referred to s 405AA, which had come into existence after the trial. The requirement of fairness nonetheless meant that ordinarily the cases for the accused and prosecution must be accurately and fairly put by the trial judge. But this did not oblige the judge to put every argument put forward by defence counsel. Their Honours continued at 561: 
     
      
       
       Whether the trial judge is bound to refer to an evidentiary matter or argument ultimately depends upon whether a reference to that matter or argument is necessary to ensure that the jurors have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the evidence to discharge their duty to determine the case according to the evidence. Consequently, the conduct of the case necessarily bears on the extent to which the judge is bound to comment on or discuss the evidence. Discussion or comment which is justified or required in one case may be neither required nor justified when a similar case is conducted in a different way.  
       
      
    71    Condon post-dated the enactment of s 405AA. Allen J said that even if it was reasonably open to the trial judge to form the opinion that a summary of the evidence was not necessary, the provision did not relieve the judge of certain duties. These included an explanation of the application of the elements in the offence to the respective cases of the Crown and the accused. Allen J said at 347: 
     
      
       
       In short, it is his duty to give them assistance so that they understand what the critical issues of fact are upon application of the law to the particular case. The trial judge is not relieved from that duty by the arguments of counsel. Indeed, as Murphy J pointed out in  
       Salvo 
       , it would not be enough even for the trial judge accurately to state what the case for the accused is as it has been presented. He must instruct the jury what the law is in respect of that case and do so in terms which throw up, clearly, what the critical issues of fact are which it raises.  
       
      
    72    The next relevant case is R v Williams (1999) 104 A Crim R 260. Wood CJ in CL considered a submission that the trial judge had failed to sufficiently summarise the key points in the defence case. Noting that the trial was a short one, his Honour said that it was entirely appropriate that the trial judge should have taken the course followed, as permitted by s 405AA. Trial judges should ensure that the jury have sufficient guidance on the issues. The need for guidance depends, of course, on the nature of the trial, its length and its complexity (Domican). Wood J emphasised the need to focus on the critical issues, which was underlined by Allen J in Condon. 
    73    Wood J added at 269: 
     
      
       
       In a single issue trial as short as this, when the summing up concluded within a morning and followed immediately upon the address of defence counsel, I am unconvinced that it was necessary for the trial judge to have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the kind that the appellant now contends for.  
       
      
    74    His Honour added a statement which has particular significance for the present appeal: 
     
      
       
       The common sense and intelligence of the jury requires respect, as does the experience of trial counsel who, in this case, expressly stated that he did not require any further direction or redirection. 
       
      
      
       
       I am unpersuaded that in a short trial, where the focus was on the complainant’s credibility, anything would have been achieved by yet another restatement of that issue or of the points made either by the Crown or by the defence. The position is likely to be otherwise in a complex and lengthy trial, to which the observations in  
       Domican  
       are particularly apposite. It would also have been otherwise had the trial judge here undertaken, for example, a detailed analysis of the Crown case and then dismissed the defence case in short terms. What is required is a fair balance when any excursion into the issues and evidence is undertaken. Again I am of the view that leave should be refused to argue this ground under r 4 of the  
       Criminal Appeal Rules 
       . [at 269 - 270] 
       
      
    75    Two days later the Court heard and delivered judgment in R v Davis [1999] NSWCCA 15. In giving judgment Wood CJ at CL said: 
     
      
       
       The trial judge, with the consent of the parties, summed up without reference to the evidence. That was a course properly open to him under s 405AA of the  
       Crimes Act 
       , in a trial that had lasted three days, in which there were only six witnesses in the Crown case and none in the defence case. On one view, that approach worked in favour of the appellant, since it avoided the one-sided appearance that may have been presented by a reiteration of the evidence called by the Crown, and silence in relation to the defence. 
       
      
      
       
       Attention was, however, drawn to the observations of this Court in  
       RJC  
       CCA NSW 18 August 1998, unreported, as well as in  
       Zorad  
       (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at 105 and  
       Condon  
       (1995) 83 ACR 335 as to the need for the jury to be instructed as to the issues of fact and law which arise in a trial, and where appropriate, to have the evidence to be related to those issues.  
       
      
      
       
       Those requirements are to be understood in the light of the explanation in  
       Domican  
       (1992) 173 CLR 555 at 561, which was discussed as recently as yesterday by this Court in  
       Williams  
       NSW CCA 9, 23 February 1999 unreported. 
        
       The need for, and the extent of, any exploration of the evidence and of the issues, in a summing-up, is to be assessed in the context of the trial, its length, its complexity and in the light of the way that it has been run. Where the summing-up in a short trial has followed hard on the heels of a defence address, particularly where the appellant has not offered any evidence, very little is likely to be achieved by a reiteration of the evidence or of the points made by counsel in their closing addresses. To so require would be to credit the jury with little in the way of intelligence or common sense. An exercise of judgment is always required, on the part of the trial judge, to frame the summing-up in a way that is helpful to the jury. To elevate the observations in  
       RJC  
       and  
       Zorad  
       to a requirement that, in every case, regardless of its length or complexity, the trial judge must identify and repeat the points made by defence counsel, the relevant evidence, would be to go too far. Counsel should be expected to contribute in this regard, and to disclose whether they seek more, by way of summary of the evidence and of the submissions, than the judge proposes. [paras 21 - 24] 
       
      
    76    In R v RNS [1999] NSWCCA 122 (7 June 1999) Bell J was dealing with a similar submission to the one here made, incidentally involving the same trial judge. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
       The trial was a short one. Evidence was taken over three days. At the conclusion of the evidence his Honour invited the jury to give careful attention to the addresses of counsel. He had earlier signalled his intention to both counsel not to summarise the evidence. This course was consented to by both counsel. Provision is made in s.405AA  
       Crimes Act  
       for a trial Judge to dispense with a summary of the evidence. That provision does not permit the trial judge to give the jury no guidance as to the way the evidence relates to the directions of law given. It does not relieve the trial Judge of the obligation to sum up the respective cases made by the Crown and the accused. [para 58] 
       
      
    77    However, her Honour did not decide the case on this ground alone and proceeded to other grounds upon which the appeal was upheld. 
    78    The most recent authority is RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3 (3 February 2000). In the joint judgment, their Honours referred to the task of trial judges in giving instructions to juries (paras 41 - 42). They stated that the trial judge should instruct the jury about the elements of the offence, the burden and standard of proof, the respective functions of judge and jury, the identification of the issues in the case and to relate the law to those issues. The judge should, of course, put the accused’s case fairly to the jury.79    However, their Honours continued: 
     
      
       
       But none of this must be permitted to obscure the division of functions between judge and jury. It is for the jury, and the jury alone, to decide the facts. As we have said, in some cases a judge must give the jury warnings about how they go about that task. And, of course, it has long been held that a trial judge may comment (and comment strongly) on factual issues. But although a trial judge  
       may  
       comment on the facts, the judge is not bound to do so except to the extent that the judge’s other functions require it. Often, perhaps much more often than not, the safer course for a trial judge will be to make no comment on the facts beyond reminding the jury, in the course of identifying the issues before them, of the arguments of counsel.  
       
      
    80    How then should these authorities be applied to the present appeal? 
    81    First, it seems to me that proper content should be given to the provision (s 405AA), now found in s 99 of the Criminal Procedure Act. It provides as follows: 
     
      
       
       99 (1) At the end of a criminal trial before a jury, a Judge need 
        
         
          not summarise the evidence given in the trial if of the  
          
         opinion that, in all the circumstances of the trial, a  
          
         summary is not necessary. 
         
        
        (2) This section applies despite any rule of law or practice to  
        
         
         the contrary. 
         
        
        (3) Nothing in this section affects any aspect of a Judge’s  
        
         
         summing up function other than the summary of evidence  
          
         in a trial. 
         
        
       
      
    82    Taking account of the circumstances of a trial, a judge may be entitled to form the opinion that a summary of the evidence is unnecessary. As observed by the High Court in Domican, whether the judge is bound to refer to the evidence depends on whether the jury would have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the evidence without assistance. Trials will vary considerably in their length, content and complexity. Allen J observed in Condon (adopted by Wood J in Williams) that guidance for the jury needs to focus on the critical issues. 
    83    Williams referred to the short length of the trial as being a factor which would favour the appropriateness of a trial judge’s decision not to summarise the facts. Wood J also referred to a single issue trial, when the summing-up follows immediately upon the defence address, as a factor relevant to the decision not to summarise the evidence.84    As I have said, Wood J’s remarks about respecting the common sense and intelligence of the jury, as well as respecting the decision of counsel in acquiescing in the judge’s decision and not seeking any further directions, are important. They are apposite to this trial which was relatively short (4 days), notwithstanding the interposition of other matters and an early adjournment on one day to allow the complainant to receive advice. Moreover, the facts were within a small compass, involving only two counts. The trial was principally a contest of credibility between the complainant and the appellant, with the focus on the complainant’s credibility. This must have been patently apparent to the jury and was underlined by his Honour in the summing-up. It is difficult to see what would have been gained (for the jury) by a restatement of the factual matters already the subject of addresses by the Crown and defence. 
    85    The strictures of the High Court in RPS are relevant. A judge is not bound to comment on the facts unless her or his other functions require it. In many cases, the safer course to take is to make no comment on the facts except to remind the jury of counsels’ arguments. This remark by their Honours in RPS raises the question of the possible dangers which may be inherent in summarising the evidence. The trial judge here was aware of this possibility when he raised the issue with counsel. He referred to the lack of a transcript and the manner in which some witnesses gave their evidence (including the complainant) making note taking almost impossible. There was the clear risk that, in summarising the evidence, his Honour could have misled the jury. 
    86    There is also the point made in Davis, another short trial with only six witnesses, that summing up on the evidence may lead to a one-sided appearance being presented to the jury. 
    87    His Honour flagged his intentions early on in the trial and gave every opportunity to counsel to object or require that he summarise the evidence, in whole or part. Counsel chose to acquiesce in the course proposed and, no doubt, framed their addresses to the jury to accommodate his Honour’s decision. 
    88    I agree with Wood J that the observations in Zorad should not be too highly elevated so as to have the effect of nullifying the power and discretion contained in s 405AA (and s 99). 
    89    The question here is whether the trial judge failed to give the jury guidance on the way the evidence related to the directions of law. Also, whether his Honour summed-up the respective cases of the Crown and the accused. 
    90    The crux of the argument made on behalf of the appellant concerns the alleged duplicity in each of the charges and his Honour’s failure to instruct the jury on the act of sexual intercourse relied on by the Crown in relation to each count. 
    91    It is necessary to have regard to the conduct of the trial and I have already referred to some of the relevant material. 
    92    What is apparent with regard to count 1 is that the prosecutor opened to the jury alleging anal intercourse. In his evidence in chief the complainant did not give any evidence of anal intercourse in relation to this count, but gave evidence of oral intercourse. In cross-examination the complainant gave evidence of the accused having had anal intercourse with him. 
    93    Doubtless the prosecutor addressed the jury on this count on the basis of anal intercourse. No objection was taken at any time by counsel for the accused. The Crown was not called upon to elect. His Honour was not asked to give any direction on the matter. In my view, the jury could not have been under any misapprehension. The consistency in the Crown approach was such as, at the least, to impliedly elect, should that have been required. 
    94    This case is quite unlike the facts of Khouzame and Saliba, where multiple acts were before the jury. Indeed, six acts in Saliba’s case. 
    95    The fourth count is similar to the first. It may reasonably be assumed that the Crown opening to the jury alleged anal intercourse. The evidence of the complainant in chief was to this effect. There was also evidence by the complainant of other acts, but the case on count 4 was always one of anal intercourse. His Honour directed the jury as to how they should treat the evidence of other acts not charged. Again, the Crown was not required to elect and no protest was raised by defence counsel, nor any request to sum-up on the issue or redirect. I can see no unfairness to the appellant in what occurred and no miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated. 
    96    In my opinion, the issue of duplicity does not arise. The summing-up, given the context of the trial and the ‘contentious’ issue, referred to by his Honour and left for the jury to consider, adequately related the elements of the offences to the evidence and summed-up the respective cases of the Crown and appellant. Given the short trial, the narrowness of the issues, and other factors mentioned, the judge was entitled to form the opinion that it was not necessary to summarise the evidence. 
    97    I would refuse leave to argue this ground pursuant to rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, see R v Jeffrey (Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 December 1993, unreported). 
     
      
     Ground 1 - use of evidence of sexual conduct not charged 
      
    98    As earlier recounted, counsel for the appellant did not oppose the leading of evidence from the complainant of allegations of sexual conduct with the appellant other than that charged. His objection was that the evidence not be used as evidence of tendency. I have already set forth in para 59 his Honour’s direction as to the use that could be made of the evidence by the jury. 
    99    Such evidence may be led to place the offences charged in context. The relationship revealed may provide the context as part of the essential background. The second way that it might be relevant is to the ‘guilty passion’ revealed and, in this situation, it may be directly relevant to proving the offences charged. Where the Crown introduces the evidence merely to place the charged offences in its context, it is not tendency evidence and cannot be used for that purpose. 
    100    When such relationship evidence is introduced, the jury should be warned that it is not entitled to substitute evidence concerning acts not charged for those the subject of the charges. They should also be warned not to reason impermissibly that the accused is guilty of the charged offences simply because he has committed the uncharged offences, R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 at 515 - 516, R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702 at 708 - 709 and BRS v The Queen (1997) 71 ALJR 1512. 
    101    The Crown concedes that the warning was not explicitly given by the trial judge. Nevertheless, Mr Berman submits that what his Honour said to the jury clearly carried with it the implicit warning not to use the evidence in any way other than to place the charged offences in context. That is, that the jury would understand from what his Honour said that they were not to reason that because they might believe that the accused was guilty of other offences not charged, he was guilty of the charged offences. 
    102    I accept the submission. It seems to me that his Honour’s direction effectively conveyed the required warnings. There was no request for any redirection and I do not believe that any miscarriage of justice was occasioned. It is relevant that his Honour did not refer to the evidence as tendency evidence in his summing-up. 
    103    This case is unlike BRS, where there was a very real risk that the jury might have misapplied the evidence and treated it as propensity evidence. In the light of the way the instant trial was run, its emphasis on counts 1 and 4 and his Honour’s directions, I do not accept that the jury could have misused the relationship evidence. It would have been better, as the Crown acknowledges, had the warning been explicit. Nonetheless, the absence of complaint at the time is significant. Rule 4 applies and the appellant has not satisfied the Court that a miscarriage of justice was occasioned. 
     
      
     Ground 2 - failure to adequately direct on delay in complaint 
      
    104    I have already set forth his Honour’s directions on how they might use the complaint material, see para 60.  
    105    Ms Burgess submits that while his Honour directed the jury to disregard the complaint in relation to the first count and stated that it did not support the complainant’s credibility, he did not go the step further. In the context of the s 405B warning given at the request of the Crown, his Honour should have told the jury that the delay in making the complaint was also relevant to the complainant’s credibility and a factor to be taken into account in assessing his consistency of conduct. 
    106    I do not see that there is anything in the point. The clear effect of his Honour’s directions was that the credibility of the complainant was affected by whether the complaint was delayed. He told the jury that early complaint may support the credit of the person making it. On the other hand, he told the jury that if a complaint was not made when you would expect it to be made, you might use that against the person. His Honour gave the jury a graphic example which they would have readily understood. 
    107    A fair reading of the relevant parts of the summing-up indicates that a balance was held. The jury were directed that lack of complaint could damage credibility just as an early complaint could bolster it. 
    108    Next it was submitted that it is difficult to see how the complaint, which it is said was in general terms, could be confined to the fourth count. I do not agree that the complaint was not descriptive of the fourth count, given the context. It was open to the jury to accept that the complaint made related directly to the fourth count, both from the evidence of the complainant and that of Ms McGrory. In any event, in R v Vinh Le [2000] NSWCCA 49 complaint evidence in general terms was admitted (Sully J at 51 - 53 and Hidden J). 
    109    It was further submitted that his Honour did not explain that the complaint evidence was not admissible as evidence of the facts complained about. That is not so. The jury was directed that the complaint material was not available to prove the facts, see Summing-Up AB 238 (p 23) - ‘not to prove that they have been raped’. 
    110    Again, it must be kept in mind that defence counsel made no objection to his Honour’s summing-up on the complaint evidence. The Crown did raise an objection and this resulted in a redirection under s 405B. In giving the redirection his Honour said: 
     
      
       
       You may take a different view. You may say “Oh, there was no complaint, therefore it did not happen, or it may not have happened.” 
       
      
    111    I would refuse leave to argue this ground pursuant to rule 4. 
     
     Ground 3 - error in summing-up on corroboration 
      
    112    His Honour gave the jury a very strong warning on corroboration, perhaps one overly generous to the appellant. He directed the jury that the complainant’s evidence was uncorroborated and that it was dangerous to convict on such evidence. 
    113    However, his Honour later said that the jury might find that the evidence of Ms McGrory might tend to corroborate some of the ‘peripheral matters’. It was submitted that his Honour should have directed the jury that the evidence of Ms McGrory did not amount to corroboration. I find nothing in the point. The strong direction that the complainant’s evidence was uncorroborated can stand with his Honour’s passing reference to possible corroboration by Ms McGrory on ‘peripheral matters’. 
    114    In the context of the issue of corroboration, his Honour did not refer to Dr Larcombe’s evidence. This worked in favour of the appellant. I would have thought that Dr Larcombe’s evidence provided some corroboration for the complainant. 
    115    Again, rule 4 applies because no point was taken at trial. In Jeffrey, Mahoney JA made some pertinent observations about the role of rule 4 where an appellant relies on misdirections or non-directions to which no objection was taken at trial. They bear repeating. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
       [It] is proper to emphasise the importance of the principle embodied in R4. 
       
      
      
       
       In my opinion, this principle plays an important part in the criminal trial process. It is important that any objection to the summing up or that any defect or omission at the trial which can be cured or mitigated by steps taken at the trial, be raised at the time of the trial. The judge should be asked to, and should have the opportunity to, correct any error or deficiency of this kind. 
       
      
      
      … 
      
      
       
       Errors will occur and R4 provides for them. But unless there be a convincing reason why the matter was not raised at the trial and unless the possibility of real injustice appears, an accused should be held to what was done by or for him at trial level. Not infrequently this Court is asked to act under R4 when the reason why the defect was not dealt with at the trial has not been established and where it is at least possible that there were tactical reasons why it was not. It is not easy for the court on appeal to satisfy itself that the reason why the matter was not raised was error rather than choice. In such circumstances, the court should be slow to act under R4. In the end, the court must exercise the power given to it by R4 according to the merits of the individual case. However, in my opinion, in exercising that power, the court should keep steadily in mind the function which R4 performs in the criminal trial process. [p 4] 
       
      
      
     Ground 4 - verdicts unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence 
      
    116    Six points are relied on by the appellant. 
     
      
     1. The directed acquittal verdicts on counts 2 and 3. This is said to affect the complainant’s credibility. 
      
      
     2. The delay in complaint. 
      
      
     3. The inconsistent evidence of the complainant. 
      
      
     4. The inconsistent statements made to police by the complainant. 
      
      
     5. The lack of corroboration, and 
      
      
     6. The appellant’s denial on oath. 
      
    117    As to the first point, the directed verdicts do not assist the appellant. This was not a trial where the jury disbelieved the complainant. In the circumstances of the trial and his clear reluctance to give evidence, the complainant could have well forgotten to tell the court about the facts of counts 2 and 3. 
    118    As to points 3 and 4 above, the inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence and police statements did not convince the jury that he was not a credible witness. Notwithstanding the inconsistencies, the evidence was such as to entitle the jury to return guilty verdicts. 
    119    The jury had the benefit of seeing the complainant giving evidence and facing cross-examination of some length. They also had the benefit of hearing the appellant give evidence and be cross-examined. The jury had the opportunity to assess their evidence at first hand. We only have the black and white of the transcript. The remarks of the judge, the unusual circumstances, the poorly educated and inarticulate complainant, his grossly deprived upbringing and the qualities of the appellant, point to the jury’s assessment of each of them and their evidence as being very important in the resolution of the case. This is not a case like Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 where the jury refused to accept the complainant on one count. Here there is no material to conclude that the jury disbelieved the complainant on any matter. 
    120    As to the delay in complaint about the fourth count, it is clear that it was open to the jury to find that the complaint was made fairly soon after the offence and that there was no real delay. 
    121    As to the absence of corroboration for the complainant, the appellant had the benefit of a very strong direction in his favour. The submission of counsel for the appellant ignores the evidence of Dr Larcombe about the consistency of the history with her observations and findings. It is plain that her evidence, including cross-examination, was not helpful to the appellant. Indeed, to the contrary.  
    122    I would reject this ground of appeal.  
    123    It follows that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
    124    SMART AJ: I agree with Stein JA. 
    125    IRELAND AJ: I agree with Stein JA.

      70060/99 - REGINA v LYNETTE MAY VANDERSEE 
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR : On 1 August 2000 after a trial presided over by me the jury found the prisoner Lynette May Vandersee not guilty of murder, but guilty of the manslaughter, of her husband Bruce Vandersee at Central Tilba on 30 June 1999. After the jury returned their verdict the proceedings on sentence were stood over for a number of weeks, to enable a pre-sentence report to be obtained. Under s24 of the Crimes Act the maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for twenty five years.  
     
      
    2   At the trial there was no real issue that in the early morning of 30 June 1999 the prisoner had killed her husband by striking him a number of times on the head, while he was sleeping, with the blunt end of the head of a small axe or tomahawk. Later on the same day 30 June 1999 the prisoner attended at the Bateman’s Bay police station and told police that she had killed her husband.  
     
      
    3   The real issue at the trial was whether the prisoner should be found guilty of the murder of her husband or whether she should be found guilty of the lesser offence of the manslaughter of her husband. Under the directions the jury were given there were three possible ways in which the jury, having been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that an act of the prisoner had caused the death of the deceased and that the prisoner’s act had not been done in self defence, could have arrived at a verdict of guilty of manslaughter, namely:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The act of the prisoner had been done with the intent required for murder, that is with the intent to kill or inflict really serious bodily injury, but the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act of the prisoner had not been done under provocation; 
       
       
      (2) The act of the prisoner had been done with the intent required for murder but the jury were satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind under s23A of the Crimes Act had been established; 
       
       
      (3) The jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act of the prisoner had been done with the intent required for murder but were satisfied that the act was unlawful and dangerous. 
       
      
    4   It is convenient to refer to these three types of manslaughter as provocation manslaughter, substantial impairment manslaughter and unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter. 
     
      
    5   Important principles governing the sentencing of persons who have been found guilty by a jury of a criminal offence were laid down by the five judge bench of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Isaacs (1998) 90 A Crim R 587. In Isaacs the Court of Criminal Appeal said:- 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The power and responsibility of determining the sentence to be inflicted upon the offender rests with the judge and not the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Subject to certain constraints it is the duty of the judge to determine the facts relevant to sentencing. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The primary constraint is that the view of the facts adopted by the trial judge for the purpose of sentencing must be consistent with the verdict of the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) A second constraint is that findings of fact made against an offender by the sentencing judge must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) There is no general requirement that a sentencing judge must sentence the offender upon the basis of a view of the facts consistent with the verdict, which is most favourable to the offender. 
        
       
      
    6   The Court of Criminal Appeal said that the above principles apply equally to sentencing for manslaughter as to sentencing for any other offence.  
     
      
    7   In accordance with the opinion expressed by the Court in Isaacs that, other than in exceptional cases, trial judges should refrain from asking the jury the basis of a verdict of manslaughter returned by the jury, I did not ask the jury what was the basis of their verdict of manslaughter. At the trial I was not asked by the Crown Prosecutor or by counsel for the prisoner to ask the jury what was the basis of their verdict of manslaughter. 
     
      
    8   In accordance with the general principles of sentencing stated earlier in their judgment the Court of Criminal Appeal in Isaacs held that, where in a trial the jury have returned a verdict of guilty of manslaughter the sentencing judge’s task is not to determine the basis upon which the jury found the prisoner guilty of manslaughter but to find for himself or herself the facts material to sentencing, consistently with the jury’s verdict of manslaughter and bearing in mind that the prisoner is to be given the benefit of any reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    9   Guided by the principles I have stated or referred to, I will proceed to find the facts of the offence of manslaughter of which the prisoner has been found guilty.  
     
      
    10   There were a large number of witnesses at the trial, who included:- 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The police who were at the Bateman’s Bay police station on 30 June 1999 or who took part in the investigation into the death of Mr Vandersee. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The prisoner’s two adult daughters by a previous marriage, Kerry Ford and Samantha Ellis. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The mother of the deceased, Mrs Vandersee. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) Mr Peter Hollands who had been a friend of both the deceased and the prisoner but who had only seen them at infrequent intervals. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) Persons who had known the prisoner and the deceased, while they lived in Tasmania before moving to Tilba. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) Persons who had seen the prisoner and the deceased in Tilba. 
        
       
       
        
        (7) A forensic pathologist Dr Bradhurst who performed the post mortem examination of the body of the deceased. 
        
       
       
        
        (8) Two forensic psychiatrists Dr Clark, who gave evidence for the prisoner, and Dr Skinner, who gave evidence for the Crown. 
        
       
      
    11   However, the principal witness to the course of her life, her relationship with the deceased and the events leading up to the killing and the killing itself, was, necessarily, the prisoner herself.  
     
      
    12   After she had gone to the Bateman’s Bay police station on 30 June 1999 the prisoner was interviewed by police in a long electronically recorded interview. An audio-video recording of this interview was admitted into evidence at the trial and was viewed and listened to by the jury and myself. In this interview conducted just a few hours after the killing, the prisoner spoke freely, giving many long narrative answers. I am satisfied that I should accept the answers given by the prisoner in the interview on 30 June 1999 as being accurate.  
     
      
    13   The prisoner gave evidence at the trial, which was held more than twelve months after the killing. It is unsurprising that at the trial she gave evidence of some matters which were not referred to in her answers in the interview on 30 June 1999. However, to the extent of any inconsistency between the answers she gave in the interview and the evidence she gave at the trial, I prefer the account given in the answers in the interview. 
     
      
    14   Because both provocation and substantial impairment were raised at the trial and because it was submitted that much of the prisoner’s previous life was relevant to either provocation or substantial impairment or both, it is necessary in my finding of the facts to cover the whole of the prisoner’s life.  
     
      
    15   The prisoner was born in Australia on 18 August 1951, so that she was forty seven years old as at 30 June 1999 and she is now forty nine years old. 
     
      
    16   The prisoner’s parents separated when she was very young and her mother went to live in Northern Ireland. The prisoner lived in Northern Ireland between the ages of four and twenty one. While living in Northern Ireland she was exposed to the troubles in that province. During her childhood she was often neglected by her mother. 
     
      
    17   In about 1972 the prisoner married her first husband, Ian Ellis, who was a British army officer serving in Northern Ireland. Soon after the marriage the prisoner and her first husband came to Australia. There were two children of this marriage, both girls, Kerry born in 1974 and Samantha born in 1975. 
     
      
    18   The prisoner’s first husband began acting violently and the violence continued until the prisoner and her first husband separated in 1979. During the marriage the prisoner’s first husband was violent to both the prisoner and the two children. He “picked on” Kerry because she had cerebral palsy and walked with a limp. On one occasion he committed a particularly violent assault on Samantha. 
     
      
    19   The prisoner left her first husband three times. The last time she left, the separation was permanent. On this occasion the prisoner, before leaving, made arrangements for her and the two children to be picked up by a friend, for her to obtain accommodation and for her to obtain employment. 
     
      
    20   The prisoner first met the deceased in 1980. Her first impression of the deceased was that he was very different from her first husband. He was not cruel; he was gentle. The prisoner moved in with the deceased just before Christmas 1980 and they were married on 31 July 1982.  
     
      
    21   The prisoner and the deceased moved to a house on the South Coast of New South Wales. The deceased’s parents came to live with them in the same house and the household became very tense. The deceased started drinking heavily, apparently under the influence of his father, and the deceased became verbally abusive to the prisoner. 
     
      
    22   In March 1985 the deceased, the prisoner and her two children moved to Tasmania. The prisoner became manager of a diagnostic department at a hospital in Launceston. The deceased worked in his occupation as a signwriter.  
     
      
    23   The prisoner and the deceased bought a house in Labrina, a tiny village some distance outside Launceston. 
     
      
    24   On three occasions spread over a number of years the deceased cut the clothes the prisoner was wearing with a pair of scissors. On the last occasion he cut her underwear off her.  
     
      
    25   On occasions the deceased came up behind the prisoner and smacked her across the back of the legs or the buttocks with a ruler or a wooden spoon or pinched her skin with his finger and thumb. The deceased would sometimes punch the prisoner in the stomach or on the arm. They were not hard punches but the deceased would sneer at the prisoner when he punched her. 
     
      
    26   The deceased had sexual intercourse with the prisoner at times when she was unwilling. She stopped attempting to say “No” because she could not be bothered fighting him anymore. On occasions the deceased twisted her nipples.  
     
      
    27   In 1988 when Kerry was fourteen and Samantha was thirteen the two girls went to New Zealand to have a holiday with their natural father. The holiday was supposed to be for only two weeks. On the day they were due back the girls telephoned from New Zealand and told the prisoner that they did not love her and that they would not be coming back to Australia. The deceased commented to the prisoner “It serves them right. I don’t want them back anyway”. 
     
      
    28   Kerry returned from New Zealand after some months. When she returned she looked “glum” and “pathetic”. The deceased said that he did not want Kerry back. Kerry lived in the household for about another couple of years. During this period the deceased and Kerry antagonised each other. Eventually Kerry moved out in about 1993. Kerry went to England, formed a relationship, married and had two children and she returned to Australia with her two children in 1998. The prisoner went to England in 1996 for five weeks to be present when Kerry had her first child.  
     
      
    29   Samantha stayed in New Zealand for about fifteen months. The prisoner received a telephone call from the New Zealand Child Welfare Department informing her that Samantha’s father had assaulted her and deserted her, that Samantha was the prisoner’s responsibility and the prisoner should arrange to have Samantha brought back to Tasmania.  
     
      
    30   Samantha returned to the household of the prisoner and the deceased in Tasmania. The deceased did not want her back. After Samantha returned, there were constant arguments between Samantha and the deceased. Samantha left the home when she was fifteen. After leaving home she lived with a neighbour and was then looked after by the Child Welfare Department.  
     
      
    31   Just before Samantha left home the deceased presented Samantha with a document prepared by him which was described at the trial as “a contract”. This document was in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I Samantha (do/do not) wish to be a loving part of the Vandersee household and family  
        
       
       
        
        (If the answer is (DO) then sign ‘A’) 
        
       
       (If the answer is (DO NOT) sign ‘B’) 
       
       
        
        (A) I promise to do what I am told to do, when I am told, and not lie. I promise to include both Mum and Dad in any decisions that have to do with my welfare friends or outings. 
        
       
       
        
        I promise to not see or ring up any boy without the permission of both Mum & Dad. 
        
       
       
        
        Sign ………………………………………. 
        
       
       
        
        (B) I do not wish to be part of the Vandersee family. Therefore I do not expect any love or financial support from the family and will revert to being known as Samantha Ellis. 
        
       
       
        
        Sign ……………………………………….” 
        
       
      
    32   The deceased read Samantha’s diary, which had been left at the house, and the deceased prepared a letter for Samantha, which was in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “DEAR MISGUIDED SAM ELLIS, 
        
       
       
        
        According to your ‘Secret Diary’ I am an asshole & I was just being mean to you and was using Shane as an excuse. 
        
       
       
        
        If you had only done as you were told to do I wouldn’t have been ‘mean’ to you. 
        
       
       
        
        Your ringing Shane was only part of my disappointment in your actions and attitude. 
        
       
       
        
        It was a culmination of lies, deceit, disobedience and unbecoming behaviour for a 14 year old. 
        
       
       
        
        Your mother and I were crushed when we found out about your smoking, drinking and your sexual activities. 
        
       
       
        
        But I suppose this would mean nothing to you. 
        
       
       
        
        This, now is all water under the bridge as you have decided to start a new life of your own which I hope will bring you all the health, wealth and happiness you wish upon yourself. Not what you deserve. 
        
       
       
        
        Please change your name on everything as Samantha VanDerSee doesn’t exist any more! 
        
       
       
        
        Your Ex Dad, 
        
       
       
        
        Bruce VanDerSee”. 
        
       
      
    33   The prisoner told the deceased that the letter was disgusting but the deceased laughed at her.  
     
      
    34   After the two girls left the household there were “ups” and “downs” in the relationship between the prisoner and the deceased. There were “ups” when the deceased was in a good mood and there were “downs” when the deceased had been drinking or was in a bad mood. The deceased remarked how peaceful it was without the prisoner’s daughters. Both daughters did make visits to the house and the visits were actually civil and quite pleasant.  
     
      
    35   The prisoner had a hearing deficit. The deceased was aware of this deficit and would either mumble or shout at her.  
     
      
    36   The prisoner had been making teddy bears for some time, selling some of them. The prisoner and the deceased agreed to leave Tasmania and go to Tilba on the South Coast of New South Wales. The prisoner felt burnt out in her job and hated the cold in Tasmania. The deceased was sick of his occupation of signwriting.  
     
      
    37   The prisoner and the deceased moved to Tilba. In Tilba they rented shop premises and rented premises in which to live. They set up a business selling teddy bears. The teddy bear shop was never a financial success.  
     
      
    38   Kerry with her two young daughters lived in Tilba from October 1998 to January 1999. Kerry had borrowed money from the prisoner and the deceased to pay for the airfares of herself and her two children from England. The deceased did not want Kerry and her children to come to live with the prisoner and himself. Kerry and her two daughters lived in the same house as the prisoner and the deceased for only two and a half weeks. The deceased adored Kerry’s older child, Bethany. The deceased complained about the younger child crying at night.  
     
      
    39   The deceased was angry with Kerry for not making Bethany, who had cerebral palsy, walk and criticized Kerry as a mother. Kerry moved out into a flat in Tilba. The deceased constantly wanted to know what Kerry was doing about making Bethany walk. He believed that he could make Bethany walk, when Kerry could not.  
     
      
    40   The deceased prepared a document whereby Kerry would promise to make Bethany walk and it was provided that, if Bethany could not walk within a certain period of time, that would show that Kerry was a pathetic mother.  
     
      
    41   The deceased gave the prisoner the document to give to Kerry on Kerry’s departure from Tilba to Western Australia. However the prisoner threw the document into a garbage bin and did not give it to Kerry. 
     
      
    42   After the departure of Kerry in January 1999, relations between the prisoner and the deceased were tense. The deceased’s conduct, consisting of verbal abuse, commenting on the prisoner’s appearance, smacking and punching the prisoner, twisting her nipples and having sexual intercourse without her consent, continued. 
     
      
    43   The prisoner attended at the teddy bear shop each day. The deceased stayed at home, making teddy bears or operating his computer. The prisoner was worried about how they would survive financially. The deceased said words to the effect that that was her problem. 
     
      
    44   The deceased would follow the prisoner around the house, he would not let the prisoner go anywhere by herself, even to the toilet. The prisoner neglected the house and her own personal appearance.  
     
      
    45   The deceased would go days at a time, without changing his clothes and without washing. In Tasmania the prisoner had made the deceased shower every day. “In Tilba after four or five days he was just putrid and I would say ‘get in the shower’”. The deceased would say “Oh stop nagging me”. 
     
      
    46   On the weekend of 19 and 20 June the deceased was away from Tilba, leaving the prisoner at Tilba.  
     
      
    47   On 20 June the prisoner logged into the internet on the deceased’s computer. She made a number of visits to the Cornell University Poisonous Plants home page and she made notes of information from this website on two pieces of paper, which became exhibits at the trial.  
     
      
    48   On these pieces of paper she recorded, inter alia, the symptoms produced in human beings by the ingestion of a number of poisonous plants, including poinsettia, fulmicort, wisteria, lantana and laburnum. For example, under the heading “lantana” she wrote:-  
     
      
       
        
        “Ataxia, laboured breath, cyanosis, death, diarrhoea, lethargy, liver congestion, pupil dilation, pinpoint pupils, unconsciousness, vomiting, weakness” 
        
       
      
    49   The prisoner claimed in her evidence that she had obtained the information about poisonous plants, because she was contemplating suicide and denied that she had any other purpose in mind. According to Dr Skinner’s evidence, which I accept, Dr Skinner asked the prisoner on 20 July 2000 “why did you look at poisonous plants on the internet?” and the prisoner replied “no definite intention, perhaps for Bruce or harm myself”. I find that on 20 June 1999 the prisoner did contemplate suicide but the possibility of administering a poisonous plant to the deceased had crossed her mind.  
     
      
    50   On the weekend before the killing the prisoner and the deceased went to Sydney for a teddy bear show. On the Thursday before the weekend the deceased’s mother came to Tilba to look after the shop in their absence. In the presence of his mother the deceased demonstrated a physical affection for the prisoner, which he did not show at other times and which the prisoner resented.  
     
      
    51   The prisoner thought that they did not have enough money to make the trip to Sydney but the deceased insisted on going. In Sydney the prisoner and the deceased entered their bears in the teddy bear making competition. On the Friday afternoon the prisoner proposed that they go out to the Gap, because she had not been there before. They went to the Gap and walked around.  
     
      
    52   On the Friday night the prisoner and the deceased went to the presentation ceremony for the winners in the teddy bear making competition. Neither the prisoner nor the deceased won. The prisoner did not care about not winning. The deceased who was “not a good loser” was upset. 
     
      
    53   On the Saturday the deceased was “just shitty about everything” and “just snide comments referring to my weight, my ugliness and my oldness”.  
     
      
    54   On the Sunday they had very little money left. The prisoner made enquiries and discovered that there was a service station which would accept payment by cheque for petrol. The prisoner proposed that they go to Manly and take a walk along the beach. However, at Circular Quay they discovered that if they paid for return ferry fares to Manly, they would have just $4 left. The prisoner proposed that, instead of going to Manly, they take a walk around the Rocks and they went for a walk around the Rocks. There were “great long silences” from the deceased.  
     
      
    55   The prisoner and the deceased set off for home. The prisoner had taken the phone number of the service station which would accept a cheque but had omitted to write down the address of the service station. The deceased called her “a dickhead” for not writing down the address. They had difficulty finding the service station. The prisoner telephoned the service station and obtained directions how to get there and eventually they arrived at the service station.  
     
      
    56   On the way home the prisoner developed a bad headache. The deceased said “You can’t have a headache” and turned the radio up.  
     
      
    57   When they arrived at their home in Tilba the deceased told his mother, in the presence of the prisoner, what a wonderful time he and the prisoner had had in Sydney. On the Monday the deceased’s mother left.  
     
      
    58   On Monday 28 June 1999 the prisoner went to the teddy bear shop, where she remained several hours.  
     
      
    59   In the evening of 28 June she conducted a teddy bear making class at the shop. She had been conducting such classes, with some interruptions, since September 1998. The class on 28 June started at about 7 pm and lasted for about two and half hours. To a person who attended the class the prisoner appeared tired. The prisoner failed to notice that a member of the class had sewn a leg on a teddy bear back to front, which was something she would ordinarily have noticed.  
     
      
    60   On Tuesday 29 June the prisoner went to the shop at 10 o’clock and remained in the shop until lunch time. At lunch time on 29 June she had a conversation with the deceased, who demanded to know why she had been using the computer on 20 June.  
     
      
    61   On 28 and 29 June Kerry, who was in Western Australia, telephoned the prisoner. The prisoner told Kerry on the telephone that she and the deceased had had a dreadful weekend in Sydney, that the deceased was furious that he had not won a prize in the teddy bear making competition and that the deceased claimed that everything that had gone wrong on the weekend had been her fault. Kerry asked her mother whether she loved the deceased and the prisoner replied that she did not. Kerry asked why the prisoner did not leave the deceased and the prisoner said that she could not. Kerry asked the prisoner to come to Perth for a holiday. When the prisoner said that she had no money, Kerry said that she and Samantha would send the prisoner money. The prisoner said “I can’t bring these problems to you”.  
     
      
    62   On the evening of 29 June the prisoner went home from the shop. She told the deceased that Kerry had asked her to go to Perth for a holiday. The deceased said to the prisoner “What did you say to her on the phone? Were you rude to her? She owes us all this money”. Some of the money Kerry had borrowed to pay for the airfares was still outstanding. The deceased demanded to know when Kerry would repay the money and whether Kerry was making Bethany walk.  
     
      
    63   The prisoner was upset and went to the bathroom in the house. The deceased followed her to the bathroom, pulled a chunk of the prisoner’s hair and cut it off with a pair of scissors. The deceased said “Now you can’t go to Perth”. The prisoner was shocked by the deceased’s act. The prisoner thought to herself “I can’t live like this any more”.  
     
      
    64   The prisoner went into the computer room, where the deceased was. The deceased sneered at the prisoner and lifted up his hand in a dismissive way. The prisoner attempted to do some sewing on a teddy bear but was unable to do so. The deceased announced that he was going to bed and went to bed.  
     
      
    65   At about 10.30 pm the prisoner went to bed. After a while she fell asleep. She woke up at about 2 am. She had been waking up at 2 am every morning. In an answer given in the interview on 30 June 1999 she said “Waking up constantly during the night with all the money that we owe”.  
     
      
    66   The prisoner gave an account in her evidence at the trial that after waking up she walked outside and looked at the stars, and while she was outside she heard a noise which sounded like someone walking on the floorboards of part of the house, that she thought it was her husband moving around inside the house and that she was terrified because she would be unable to give her husband a reason for being outside the house. She grabbed the axe from the wood pile in the yard because she was frightened of her husband and then went back inside.  
     
      
    67   The prisoner gave a quite different account when she was interviewed by police on 30 June 1999, only a few hours after the killing. She said in part of her answer to Q42 in the interview that, after getting up, she looked at the night sky from within the house. After a digression, she continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I can’t say what thoughts made me think, the moon, the way the moon was shining, because, like, just shining on the axe which is stuck in a piece of wood outside, you know, there’s the axe and I thought, mmm, so I went outside, took it out of the piece of wood and went back inside again ……” 
        
       
      
    68   In this version the prisoner first saw the axe while she was still inside the house and she went outside the house to get the axe. There was no mention in this version of her hearing noises from the house or being frightened of her husband. 
     
      
    69   I accept what the prisoner said in the answer to Q42 in the interview and I do not accept her evidence, to the extent to which it is inconsistent with the answer she gave to the police.  
     
      
    70   After re-entering the house with the axe, the prisoner heard her husband snoring. She became angry, because, if she happened to snore, her husband would kick her until she woke up. The prisoner could see the shape of the deceased in the bed. She hit the deceased on the head a number of times with the blunt end of the axe head. She thought that she had hit him four or five times. Dr Bradhurst, the pathologist, found eight distinct wounds on the deceased’s head and I find that there were eight blows. In Dr Bradhurst’s opinion, which I accept, a severe degree of force was used. Photographs of the deceased’s head showed deep gouges to the head.  
     
      
    71   The prisoner said that she did not know what her thought processes were at the time of striking the deceased with the axe. Immediately afterwards she realized that what she had done was wrong but she could not recall thinking that while she was striking the deceased.  
     
      
    72   The prisoner washed the axe. The prisoner noticed that there were blood stains on a curtain. She washed the curtain, but not, I accept, for the purpose of avoiding responsibility for the crime.  
     
      
    73   The deceased was breathing loudly and the prisoner got a doona from another bedroom and covered the deceased with the doona, so that the prisoner did not hear the breathing.  
     
      
    74   When the deceased stopped breathing, the prisoner got a drink of water and sat on the back step of the house, watching the sun rise.  
     
      
    75   The prisoner changed out of her pyjamas into street clothes, because she needed to go to the shop to put a sign in the window to say that the shop would not be open that day. She went to the shop and put a sign in the window. She left a message in the shop that a customer who had almost completely paid off a layby could have the goods.  
     
      
    76   The prisoner cut the rest of her hair short, showered, packed a bag, took a last walk along the beach and drove to the Bateman’s Bay police station. She went to the Bateman’s Bay police station, because she did not want to run the risk of meeting anyone she knew at the Narooma police station, which was nearer.  
     
      
    77   She presented herself at the counter of Bateman’s Bay police station at 12.15 pm. She told Constable Flood, a female officer at the counter, that she had hit her husband in the head with an axe and that he was dead. Constable Flood gave evidence, which I accept, that the prisoner displayed no emotion, that she spoke freely of what she had done, that she was calm but that she was a little withdrawn.  
     
      
    78   The prisoner was interviewed by police in a recorded interview, which commenced at 1.34 pm and concluded at 2.40 pm. She appeared calm and composed in the video of the interview. She gave long narrative answers to many of the questions she was asked.  
     
      
    79   The following questions and answers occurred in the interview: 
     
      
       
        
        Q64: Was there any violence, in, in, in your marriage? 
         
         
        A. No, he wasn’t a violent man, it was all words, it wasn’t, he was never violent, physically violent, he has never hit me.  
        
       
       
        
        Q65: Okay, was there any abuse in your marriage? 
         
        I gather what you are talking about today is mental abuse. 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yeah …..” 
        
       
      
    80   Reliance was placed in argument on some of the evidence given by the witnesses who saw the prisoner or the deceased in Tilba. None of these witnesses had any close association with either the prisoner or the deceased. 
     
      
    81   Mr. Windever gave evidence that on 23 June 1999 the prisoner had sounded upset when she told Mr Windever on the telephone that an application that she had made for a loan had been unsuccessful. It is to be borne in mind that Mr Windever was the property manager of the real estate firm which managed the residential premises in which the prisoner and the deceased were living and at the time of the telephone conversation the prisoner and the deceased owed about three months rent. By this time the prisoner and the deceased also owed about three months rent on the shop premises.  
     
      
    82   Mr Kropf gave evidence that in Tilba the prisoner would appear to be happy one day, moody the next. Sometimes she would walk down the street, with her head down, not acknowledging other people.  
     
      
    83   Mr Jones who operated a store in Central Tilba gave evidence that a few days before 30 June he saw the prisoner walking with her head down.  
     
      
    84   Ms Preston gave evidence that if the deceased said “Right we’re going, she (the prisoner) would jump”.  
     
      
    85   Catherina Whiffen attended the teddy bear making classes. The classes were conducted either at the shop or at the prisoner’s house. The classes initially used to run to about 9.30, with the participants having coffee towards the end of the class. However, at the instigation of the deceased, who was present at classes conducted in the house, coffee was served near the beginning of the class and conversation after the class had finished was eliminated. Ms Whiffen said “I don’t think he wanted her to have any friends”. She also gave evidence of examples of dictatorial conduct by the deceased in regard to the prisoner.  
     
      
    86   After this summary of the facts I return to the question of determining the basis or bases on which I should find that the prisoner committed the offence of manslaughter. 
     
      
    87   Neither the Crown Prosecutor nor counsel for the prisoner submitted that I should find that the prisoner, not having the intent required for murder, committed unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner did the act, or rather the acts, causing death, that is the eight acts of striking the deceased with the axe, with the intent required for murder. 
     
      
    88   It is true that the prisoner did not make any admission of having had an intent to kill or to inflict really serious bodily injury. She said in her evidence that she did not know what her thought processes were at the time of killing the deceased. However, I am satisfied that the only reasonable inference that could be drawn from the circumstances that she struck the deceased eight times on his head with an axe with a severe degree of force, even if she used the blunt end of the head of the axe, is that at the time of striking the deceased she had the intent required for murder. I accordingly consider that the prisoner should not be sentenced on the basis that she committed unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter. 
     
      
    89   I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that her intention at the time of striking the deceased was to kill the deceased and not merely to inflict really serious bodily injury. In addition to the circumstances I have already mentioned, her conduct soon after striking the deceased supports the inference that at the time of striking the deceased she intended to kill him. 
     
      
    90   Both the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the prisoner submitted that I should find that the prisoner had committed provocation manslaughter. I agree that I should find that the Crown did not succeed in proving beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner in killing the deceased did not act under provocation. Having found that the Crown did not succeed in discharging the onus of disproving provocation, I am required to sentence the prisoner on the basis that the acts of striking were done as a result of a loss of self control on the part of the prisoner that was induced by conduct of the deceased and that the conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the prisoner to have so far lost self control as to have formed at least an intention to inflict really serious bodily injury. 
     
      
    91   Counsel for the prisoner submitted, and the Crown Prosecutor disputed, that I should also find that the prisoner committed substantial impairment manslaughter. I accept the submission made by counsel for the prisoner that there would be no inconsistency in my finding both provocation manslaughter and substantial impairment manslaughter.  
     
      
    92   Under s23A of the Crimes Act, which came into effect on 3 April 1998, a person who would otherwise be guilty of murder is guilty of manslaughter, if:- 
     
      
    93   1. At the time of doing the act causing death the person’s capacity to understand events or to judge whether his or her actions were right or wrong or to control himself or herself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition and 
     
      
    94   2. The impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. 
     
      
    95   The onus is on an accused person to prove both parts of the defence on the balance of probabilities. 
     
      
    96   As previously indicated, two psychiatrists gave evidence at the trial. Dr Clark gave evidence for the prisoner and Dr Skinner gave evidence for the Crown. 
     
      
    97   Dr Clark saw the prisoner on four occasions in June and July 2000. The first occasion was on 21 June. The last occasion was on 24 July. 
     
      
    98   Dr Clark took a history from the prisoner. He gave evidence that among other things the prisoner told him about the deceased’s conduct:- 
     
      
       
        
        “She said it was an insidious process initially of demeaning her and then treating her like a sub-human being, not allowing her any freedoms, and this gradually got worse and worse until there were physical assaults in the sense of sexual assaults. And this - and I think the final incident was when he allegedly cut her hair off”. 
        
       
      
    99   Dr Clark formed the opinion that at the time of killing the deceased the prisoner was suffering from a major depression. He considered that factors which supported this opinion were the nihilistic nature of the act of killing, that the prisoner had been thinking of suicide, that she had been suffering from sleep disturbance, that she had lost interest in everyday things, that she had been neglecting herself, taking no pride in her appearance and that her weight had been fluctuating. 
     
      
    100   Dr Clark was asked whether in his opinion the prisoner had suffered from a bipolar disorder and he replied:- 
     
      
       
        
        “This only became a possibility to my mind when I considered her presenting state in the last couple of times I’d seen her. And she appears much brighter now”. 
        
       
      
    101   Dr Clark noted that the prisoner had described herself as being “dissociated” at the time of the killing. 
     
      
    102   Dr Clark considered that the prisoner’s capacity to control herself had been substantially impaired at the time of the killing and that her capacity to reason had been impaired. 
     
      
    103   In cross-examination Dr Clark was vague about the dates of the occasions on which he had seen the prisoner. He agreed that while he had read a transcript of the interview of the prisoner by the police on 30 June 1999, he had not seen (or listened to) a video of the interview. 
     
      
    104   Dr Clark was cross-examined about the history he had received from the prisoner and the way in which he had recorded it. Dr Clark had chosen the word “tyrannical” to describe what he had been told by the prisoner about the deceased’s conduct. The prisoner had told Dr Clark that the deceased had “imprisoned” or “enslaved” her. Dr Clark had described the prisoner as being in “a cocoon of terror”. 
     
      
    105   Dr Clark recorded the prisoner as telling him that in the early morning of 30 June 1999 she had gone outside and was looking at the moon, when she saw the moonlight on the axe. She also told Dr Clark that she was apprehensive in case the deceased woke up. 
     
      
    106   Dr Clark identified as indicia of depression:- 
     
      
       
      (i) Depressed mood 
       
       
      (ii) Diminished interest in activities 
       
       
      (iii) Weight loss or weight gain 
       
       
      (iv) Insomnia or hypersomnia 
       
       
      (v) psychomotor agitation or retardation 
       
       
      (vi) Fatigue 
       
       
      (vii) Feelings of worthlessness 
       
       
      (viii) Diminished ability to think 
       
       
      (ix) Recurrent thoughts of death and suicide 
       
      
    107   Dr Skinner saw the prisoner on one occasion only, on 20 July 2000, when she saw the prisoner for two and a half hours. She took a history from the prisoner. She watched and listened to the video of the interview of the prisoner on 30 June 1999. 
     
      
    108   As I have already noted, the prisoner told Dr Skinner, when asked by Dr Skinner why she had looked up poisonous plants on the internet, “I had no definite intention, perhaps for Bruce or harm myself”. 
     
      
    109   Dr Skinner expressed the opinion that while the prisoner may have been suffering from depression at the time of the killing, it was a mild, and not a severe, form of depression. 
     
      
    110   Dr Skinner gave the following evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “... to laymen’s understanding depression means a feeling of sadness and perhaps despondency, a sad mood. To the psychiatrist, clinical depression is a term used when the depression is so severe that it begins to affect physical functioning and the person with, what we would describe as a clinical depression, has a number of characteristic features, such as a sleep disturbance, which is usually characterised by early morning waking; physical changes, such as a severe slowing of all movements so that the person walks, talks and moves very much more slowly than normal. And there’s often long pauses before they initiate a movement, so there’ll be sitting in a chair and then remain seated before they actually initiate an action that they’re contemplating. 
        
       
       
        
        Persons with severe depression often have a very characteristic sort of facial expression, like a really worried frown, but something that can’t be mimicked. It is a particular expression that anyone looking at them would recognise them as looking sad, down, depressed, and it is a constant mood, so that they’re constantly unhappy, sad, and they’re not able to brighten up. And even the things that they normally enjoy very much they’re just not able to get any enjoyment out of it. They remain feeling very sad and miserable and just can’t get pleasure out of anything. 
        
       
       
        
        They withdraw socially and don’t want to talk to other people. Some people won’t even answer the phone, won’t go out. If they do talk to someone it’s just a one or two word reply. So the depressed person will spend a lot of time sitting in a chair, neglecting himself not even showering sometimes, not even worrying what they look like, not caring about things. And there’s an impairment of cognitive functioning. By that I mean ability to think clearly, to remember things, to concentrate on things, and so they’re not able to carry out their normal functioning in a job or in a - you know, in any normal capacity. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Would you expect a person suffering from such a severe clinical depression to be able to run or conduct a business? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No, they wouldn’t be able to effectively conduct a business. If they had a business you would expect the business would be run down because they would be just sitting there doing very little”. 
        
       
      
    111   In Dr Skinner’s opinion, the prisoner’s capacity had not been impaired at the time of the killing in any of the respects set out in s23A of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    112   Dr Skinner was cross-examined at considerable length and I have taken all of this cross-examination into account. 
     
      
    113   Dr Skinner accepted that the teddy bear business being conducted by the prisoner would have been a comparatively undemanding business to conduct. However, she said that, if the prisoner had been severely depressed, the prisoner probably would not have gone to the shop or would have been very unreliable about opening the shop.  
     
      
    114   Dr Skinner pointed out that during the trip to Sydney on the week-end preceding the killing, it was the prisoner who had initiated or proposed a number of activities, like going to The Gap, going by ferry to Manly, going to The Rocks and discovering a service station which would accept payment by cheque. Dr Skinner said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “To think of going on a trip to Manly to me suggests the person is looking at something that they might… enjoy”. 
        
       
      
    115   Evidence of observations of the prisoner by persons in Tilba was put to Dr Skinner. Dr Skinner did not agree that instances of the prisoner sounding upset, looking unhappy and walking with her head down not acknowledging people, indicated severe depression.  
     
      
    116   In Dr Skinner’s opinion, the prisoner’s failure to notice that a member of her teddy bear making class had sewn on a leg back to front was a lapse of concentration and not an indicator of severe depression. She said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I think a person with severe depression would probably not have run the class or would have been noticeably distracted or would have suffered a more severe cognitive impairment, they wouldn’t have been able to run the class in an organised way”. 
        
       
      
    117   Dr Skinner had recorded in her notes that on 20 June the prisoner had contemplated suicide. However, the prisoner had not carried out any action to harm herself and had subsequently continued to carry on the business and had gone on the trip to Sydney. There was nothing to indicate that the prisoner had been thinking about suicide during the whole period of ten days between 20 June and 30 June. 
     
      
    118   In forming her conclusion that the prisoner was suffering from only a mild form of depression, Dr Skinner took into account her viewing of the video of the interview. She thought the interview was significant, because it took place so close to the time of the killing. On the basis of her viewing of the video Dr Skinner said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I formed a conclusion that she did not have the characteristics of a person with severe depression. There was no evidence of some of those features that I’ve described, such as the depressed face, with the worried frown sort of look, the motor retardation, slowness of speech; none of those things were present”. 
        
       
      
    119   Dr Skinner gave evidence that coming out of or recovering from a severe depression is gradual (and hence would be unlikely to occur in the few hours between the time of the killing and the time of the interview). 
     
      
    120   Dr Skinner said that during the marriage the deceased had not been totally controlling. The prisoner had been employed or had operated a business. The prisoner had had at least some say in the relationship. When she was offended by the deceased’s lack of personal hygiene, she had told him to take a shower. She was the one who during the trip to Sydney made suggestions about what they should do.  
     
      
    121   I consider that I should prefer the evidence of Dr Skinner to the evidence of Dr Clark and should find that, while the prisoner was suffering from depression at the time of the killing, it was a mild depression and not a severe depression.  
     
      
    122   In my opinion, it was a considerable advantage for Dr Skinner that she viewed the video of the interview of the prisoner on 30 June 1999 and saw and heard the prisoner being interviewed, whereas Dr Clark did not. I have viewed and listened to the recording of the interview and I accept Dr Skinner’s evidence that during the interview the prisoner did not appear to be severely depressed. 
     
      
    123   I have rejected as inaccurate parts of the history which was given by the prisoner to Dr Clark and on which Dr Clark based his opinion, for example the parts of the history in which the prisoner said that she was already outside when she first saw the moonlight on the axe and that she took the axe because she was afraid of the deceased. 
     
      
    124   I consider that some of the history as recorded by Dr Clark, including that the deceased had “enslaved” the prisoner and that the prisoner was living in “a cocoon of terror” overstates the true history. 
     
      
    125   I consider that it is significant in assessing the degree of the prisoner’s depression that up to the day of the killing the prisoner continued to operate the shop and to conduct the teddy bear making classes and that on the previous week-end in Sydney she had initiated activities and she had given thought to what might be pleasurable activities to engage in. 
     
      
    126   I do not consider that I should find that the prisoner suffered from a bipolar disorder. Dr Clark regarded it as only a “possibility” that the prisoner suffered from a bipolar disorder and the basis given for even this possibility seems to me to be flimsy. An opinion by a general practitioner who had seen the prisoner in Tasmania was formed only in hindsight.  
     
      
    127   I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at the time of the killing the prisoner’s capacity to understand events or to judge whether her actions were right or wrong or to control herself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition. Alternatively, I would not be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that any impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. Accordingly, I do not find that the prisoner is to be sentenced on the basis that she committed substantial impairment manslaughter.  
     
      
    128   Although I have found that the prisoner did not commit substantial impairment manslaughter, she was suffering from mild depression at the time of killing the deceased and this state of mind is a circumstance of mitigation. 
     
      
    129   I was referred by both the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the prisoner to a number of authorities, for the principles of sentencing stated in them or in support of a submission that the sentencing decision in a particular authority afforded some guidance to what would be a proper sentence in the present case. 
     
      
    130   In R v Blacklidge (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 12 December 1995), which was a case dealing with manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility but in which statements of principle were made which are applicable to manslaughter generally, Gleeson CJ, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, said at p 4:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes, manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability. 
        
       
       
        
        At the same time, the courts have repeatedly stressed that what is involved in every case of manslaughter is the felonious taking of a human life. That is the starting point for a consideration of the appropriate penalty, and a key element in the assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case. ( 
        R v Dodd 
         (1991) 57 A Crim R 349;  
        R v Hill 
         (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402). 
        
       
      
    131   In R v Morabito (1992) 62 A Crim R 82 Wood J, as his Honour then was, who delivered the leading judgment and with whom the other members of the Court agreed, referred with approval at 85-86 to what Lee J had said in R v Whalen (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 5 April 1991):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… society can never condone the taking of a human life as a solution to marital discord. The law does no more than recognise that provocation can overcome a person’s self-control and result in that person killing another, and in that circumstance it allows the crime to be seen as manslaughter, not murder”. 
        
       
      
    132   In R v Alexander (1994) 78 A Crim R 141 Hunt CJ at CL, sitting without a jury, found the accused guilty of provocation manslaughter. In his remarks on sentence his Honour said that he agreed with the view that “it is only in most exceptional circumstances that a non-custodial sentence will be imposed in a domestic provocation case”. 
     
      
    133   In his remarks on sentence in Alexander Hunt CJ at CL suggested that three particular matters had been taken into account in provocation manslaughter cases:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) the degree of provocation offered (or, alternatively, the extent of the loss of self-control suffered), which when great has the tendency of reducing the objective gravity of the offence; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) the time between the provocation (whether isolated or cumulative in its effect) and the loss of self-control, which when short also has the tendency of reducing the objective gravity of the offence; and 
        
       
       
        
        (3) the degree of violence or aggression displayed by the prisoner, which when excessive has the tendency of increasing the objective gravity of the offence”. 
        
       
      
    134   The Crown Prosecutor referred me to a number of cases, which it was submitted might afford some guidance in sentencing the prisoner. The Crown Prosecutor referred particularly to R v Whalen, in which the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed a prisoner’s appeal against a sentence of eight years, with a minimum term of five years. Whalen was a case in which a wife in an unhappy marriage, who had been subjected to psychological mistreatment by her husband humiliating her rather than to physical violence, had killed her husband while he was in bed, using an axe and a knife. 
     
      
    135   Counsel for the prisoner submitted that I should find, and I accept that I should find, that there was provocative conduct by the deceased, both over an extended period down to 29 June 1999 and on the night of 29 June itself. 
     
      
    136   Without endeavouring to be exhaustive, I am satisfied that the deceased was a domineering and controlling person, who sought to dominate and control the prisoner, even to the extent of following her around in the house. He was not, however, completely controlling. The deceased was a recluse himself and he sought to prevent the prisoner from having a social life of her own. The prisoner found the relationship “stifling”. 
     
      
    137   The deceased used cruel and abusive language to the prisoner. He made cruel comments about her alleged lack of intelligence and about her physical appearance. The deceased demonstrated a false affection for the prisoner in the presence of his mother, which he did not show when he and the prisoner were alone together. He had been at times domineering and cruel to the prisoner’s daughters and had made cruel comments about her daughters to the prisoner. 
     
      
    138   On the night of 29 June the deceased cut off part of the prisoner’s hair for the purpose of preventing her going to visit her daughter Kerry in Perth. This was a triggering event. Subsequently that night the deceased behaved towards the prisoner in the way I have described. 
     
      
    139   During the marriage the deceased committed acts of physical abuse against the prisoner, such as smacking her legs and buttocks with a ruler, pinching her, lightly punching her in the stomach or arm, twisting her nipples and requiring her to have sexual intercourse with him, when she was unwilling, indicating that he was using the prisoner for his own sexual relief.  
     
      
    140   These acts of physical abuse were humiliating and distressing. I consider that they were regarded by the prisoner primarily as psychological abuse, rather than as physical violence. When the prisoner was interviewed by the police, she said that the deceased had not been a physically violent man and that what she was complaining of was mental abuse. 
     
      
    141   As regards the three matters identified by Hunt CJ at CL in Alexander: 
     
      
    142   1. The degree of provocation and the extent of loss of self-control. 
     
      
    143   In assessing the degree of provocation to the prisoner, it is necessary to take into account the personal characteristics of the prisoner, including her emotionally deprived and troubled childhood and adolescence and her abusive first marriage. When compared with the provocation in some of the other cases to which I was referred, I consider that the degree of provocation in the present case should be assessed as medium, rather than great. I do not consider that the prisoner suffered a complete loss of self-control, even after taking into account the violence of the acts of killing. 
     
      
    144   2. The time between the provocation and the loss of self-control. 
     
      
    145   Some hours elapsed between the last provocative conduct on the part of the deceased before he went to bed and the killing of the deceased. This was not a case of an immediate response done in the heat of the moment. The prisoner formed the intent to use the axe to strike the deceased, when, from inside the house, she saw the moonlight shining on the axe. She sustained this intention, while she went outside, got the axe and returned inside. 
     
      
    146   3. The degree of violence or aggression displayed by the prisoner. 
     
      
    147   The degree of violence was very great. The prisoner struck the deceased eight times on the head with the axe with a severe degree of force, while the deceased was sleeping.  
     
      
    148   I have already referred to many of the subjective circumstances of the prisoner. She was forty-seven years old at the time of killing the deceased. She had been married twice and had two daughters by her first marriage. She had no previous criminal history. She had been employed in a diagnostic department at a hospital in Tasmania and had then carried on the teddy bear shop at Tilba.  
     
      
    149   On 30 June 1999 she handed herself in at the Batemans Bay police station and made extensive admissions about killing the deceased. Her admissions were tantamount to an admission of guilt of manslaughter. I do not, however, consider that she is entitled to a discount in sentencing on the basis of the principle in R v Ellis. Even if she had not gone to the police, the death of the deceased, her husband, would soon have been discovered and there would have been a powerful circumstantial case against the prisoner that she had killed him. 
     
      
    150   The summary in the pre-sentence report, which was prepared by a Probation and Parole officer who had seen the prisoner a number of times while she was on bail pending her trial, was:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Over the past year it has become apparent to the writer that Ms Vandersee was neglected and probably disliked by her mother, and was subject to physical, emotional and sexual abuse throughout her life. She has spent the past year looking at difficult emotional issues and memories which she had suppressed for many years. Ms Vandersee has looked closely at how these events led to her committing the offence, and has made significant progress in making the changes necessary to avoid such behaviour in the future. 
        
       
       
        
        Despite the intensive support of the writer, her sister, her daughters, her counsellor and her friends, Ms Vandersee continues to lack self-confidence and to doubt her self-worth. A small example of this is her embarrassment about telling anyone, including custodial staff at the prison, of her hearing impairment (she is 90% deaf in one ear and 30% deaf in the other)”. 
        
       
      
    151   As I have already noted, on 30 June 1999 the prisoner handed herself into the police and admitted her guilt. However, she did not express any regret that she had killed her husband. 
     
      
    152   I have taken into account a reference from a Catholic priest whose congregation the prisoner has joined and a number of other references. The priest considers that “she is a fundamentally sound and responsible person”. 
     
      
    153   In my opinion, this is not an exceptional case in which a non-custodial sentence could properly be imposed. The sentence will commence from 1 August 2000, being the date on which, after the jury had returned its verdict of guilty of manslaughter, I declined to continue the prisoner’s bail. I am satisfied that there are special circumstances within s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, in that the prisoner is a middle aged woman who has never been in prison before and who will require a proportionally longer than usual period of supervised liberty after she is released. 
     
      
    154   I have endeavoured to take into account all relevant factors, including the objective gravity of the offence of taking the deceased’s life, that the offence was committed under provocation, that the prisoner was depressed at the time of committing the offence and the subjective features of the prisoner. Mrs Vandersee, I sentence you to imprisonment for eight years commencing on 1 August 2000. I set a non-parole period of five years commencing on 1 August 2000. I specify 1 August 2005 as the earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole.Addendum to Remarks on Sentence:With reference to par149 of the Remarks on Setence, I have allowed the prisoner a discount for handing herself in and making extensive early admissions, alhough I do not consider that she is entitled to a further discount on a basis that, apart from her admissions, the offence and her guilt of the offence would be unlikely to have been discovered. On 30 June 1999 the prisoner made admissions that she had killed the deceased by striking him on the head with an axe. However, there were a number of issues at the trial which were not covered by admissions made by the prisoner on 30 June 1999, including whether the prisoner had acted with the intent required for murder, whether the Crown had proved that the prisoner did not act in self defence, whether the prisoner could establish the defence of substantial impairment and a number of aspects of whether the prisoner had not acted under provocation.

       REGINA v Russell Alexander MARSH 
       
      
    FactsThe Appellant was convicted of 6 out of 8 counts which alleged sexual and physical abuse of a woman with whom he was having a relationship. The Appellant raised 9 grounds of appeal against the convictions. Among these were that the trial judge, Holt DCJ, erred in admitting evidence of assaults (both physical and sexual) that were not the subject of a count on the indictment, that his Honour did not give adequate directions concerning the use the jury could make of that evidence, that his Honour erred in admitting other evidence including two exhibits, R and S and that the trial miscarried by reason of the failure of trial counsel to object to evidence said to be inadmissible and by the failure of trial counsel to seek a discharge of the jury when that evidence was given.  
     
      
    Held(per Adams J, Spigelman CJ and Newman J agreeing)1 Each count on the indictment occurred in its own factual setting which provided an adequate context in which to evaluate and understand the allegation charged. His Honour erred in admitting, as “context” evidence, evidence of assaults that were not the subject of any count on the indictment. The evidence was highly prejudicial and not probative of the allegations in any of the counts. R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510, R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 discussed.2 His Honour erred in not directing the jury that it could not use the “context” evidence as tendency or propensity. B v The Queen (1992) 175 CLR 599, BRS v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 275 and Gipp v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 106 discussed.3 His Honour erred in admitting into evidence exhibits R and S.4 His Honour erred in admitting other material, particularly evidence of the complainant, into evidence despite defence counsel’s failure to object to some of that evidence. Discussion of the duty of prosecuting counsel to control his or her witnesses and to ensure that only admissible evidence is placed before the jury. 
     
      
    OrdersLeave to appeal granted; appeal allowed; convictions quashed and a new trial ordered.

       REGINA v Russell Alexander MARSH 
        
       JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Adams J. 
     
      
    2    NEWMAN J: I agree with the orders proposed by Adams J. 
     
      
    3    ADAMS J: On 17 September 1998, the appellant was convicted of a number of offences of violence, both sexual and non-sexual with one Fiona Field, following a trial lasting about five weeks. The counts in the indictment were as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Count 1 
        
       
       
        
        That he between 31 August 1994 and 1 October 1994, at Merrylands, in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with Fiona Field without the consent of the said Fiona Field knowing she was not consenting. 
        
       
       
       
        
        Count 2 
        
       
       
        
        Further that he on or about 2 July 1995, at Merrylands in the State of New South Wales, did assault Fiona Field. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3 
        
       
       
        
        Further that he on or about 4 December 1995, at Merrylands, in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with Fiona Field without the consent of the said Fiona Field, knowing she was not consenting. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4 
        
       
       
        
        Further that he on 4 December 1995, at Merrylands, in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with Fiona Field without the consent of the said Fiona Field, knowing she was not consenting. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 5 
        
       
       
        
        Further that he on 4 December 1995, at Merrylands in the State of New South Wales, did assault Fiona Field. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 6 
        
       
       
        
        Further that he between 31 January 1996 and 1 March 1996, at Belmont in the State of New South Wales did assault Fiona Field thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 7 
        
       
       
        
        Further that he between 31 January 1996 land 1 March 1996 at Belmont, in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with Fiona Field without the consent of the said Fiona Field knowing she was not consenting. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 8 
        
       
       
        
        Further that he between 31 January 1996 and 1 March 1996 at Belmont, in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with Fiona Field without the consent of the said Fiona Field, knowing she was not consenting.” 
        
       
      
    4    The jury were unable to agree in respect of count 3 and acquitted the appellant in respect of count 6. Before coming to the grounds of appeal, it is useful to set out in summary the evidence at the trial, since the grounds require consideration of that evidence to a greater or lesser degree. I have set out much more than is conventional since, in a number of significant respects, no summary can adequately reflect the actual course of the trial, in which the prosecution case was largely hijacked by the chief Crown witness, the complainant. 
     
      
    5    The evidence of the complainant commenced with an account of her first meeting with the appellant when she was about sixteen years old in 1990 and had undertaken work experience at Flemington Police Station where the appellant was then stationed. She saw him several times during that week. The following year, she contacted Flemington Police Station because she was having problems with somebody, as she put it, and the appellant answered the telephone and in due course, it seems, both went to court in connection with the matter. The complainant did not meet the appellant again until shortly after June 1994 when he telephoned her and asked if the two of them could meet. She said that he told her that he had liked her ever since she was sixteen when she did her work experience and that he would drive around the school looking for her. Shortly after, they met in the city for coffee. She said that the appellant was behaving oddly and was touching and trying to cuddle her and she left. The appellant then started telephoning her, sending her cards in the mail and once sending a big teddy bear and flowers. The complainant said that he would come to the house where she was living whilst he was on duty and that, on a couple of occasions, she visited his premises. She said that, on one of these occasions, she went over because she felt sorry for him when he told her that he was going to hurt himself because of his unhappy relationship with his ex-girlfriend and his hatred for the police he worked with. She said that she kept telling the appellant that she only wanted to be a friend, that he was a lot older than she was and that she had no feelings of attraction for him. However, he was persistent.  
     
      
       
      About late September 1994, the appellant moved to within walking distance from the complainant’s residence and telephoned her to invite her to inspect his premises. For some time, according to the complainant, the appellant had said to her that he loved her, wanted to get her pregnant and wanted her to have his baby. On the occasion when she first visited him in his new unit, he repeated these statements. She said that she told him that she was sick of this sort of talk and wanted just to be friends, that she did not care for him. The complainant alleged that the appellant then pushed her onto the bed and pulled her shorts down, tearing them. She told him that she did not want to fall pregnant, that she was near the middle of her cycle, and that she did not want to have sex with him. She tried ineffectively to push him off her but he succeeded in effecting sexual intercourse. The complainant said the appellant was laughing and it was all a big joke to him. She said that she was very angry and upset. The appellant told her that this was the first time he had had sex in four years and either on this occasion or shortly after said that he was sorry when she asked him if he realised that he had raped her. The appellant said to her that she could go the police if she wanted to but he would go to gaol and asked if that is what she wanted. She said that at that stage she did not want him to go to gaol “but you know, and I just felt sorry for him and I just shut up about it and thought we’d just stay friends”. The complainant said that she felt that probably nobody would believe her anyway, because “back then I had a lot of problems”.  
       
      
    6    When the complainant went home after the assault, she told her flatmate, Janys Young, what happened. Ms Young was called to give evidence in the trial. She said that the complainant had gone to the appellant’s house, in effect, one evening but had not come back until the following morning at about 6.30 or 7 o’clock when Ms Young was getting ready for work. Ms Young said that the complainant “sort of stumbled to the door looking extremely distressed and very disoriented...she looked like she could hardly walk...she was very pale, a little bit incoherent, I really couldn’t get much out of her at all”. She said that the complainant could not say much more, but told her “last night Russell assaulted me, I can’t believe he would do it”. Ms Young said that the complainant was still wearing shorts from the night before and pointed to a rip which she saw was along the front zipper. Over the next few days, Ms Young tried to encourage the complainant to tell her what had happened.  
     
      
    7    The account which emerged was that the complainant was exhausted and did not think she could manage to walk home. She had been trying to rest and had fallen asleep, or was close to falling asleep and that, whilst she was lying (semble, on the bed) she “sort of came to and Russell was on top of me trying to sort of force me into having sex with him”. She said that she told him not to, to just go away and kept struggling but that the appellant “kept getting rough with me, in fact he was even trying to get my shorts off and he got so frustrated he started ripping them”. This account, of course, differs significantly from that which the complainant had given in her evidence. The complainant said that the appellant had thrown her onto the bed following statements about loving her, wanting to get her pregnant and wanting her to have his child, and that the complainant had said that she did not wish to have a child, that she had problems of her own and would have a child only with someone whom she cared for and she did not care for him. She said that he had pushed her onto the bed, whereas she told Ms Young that she had been lying down and woke up to find him top of her. Ms Young said that she asked the complainant, “Did he rape you?” and that the complainant replied, “He assaulted me”, and that the complainant did not like to use the word “rape” at first until Ms Field questioned her further, asking, “Did he sexually assault you, do you think it was rape?” to which the complainant replied, “How could a friend rape someone they love?” Ms Young then asked, “Did he force himself on you, would you consider that to be rape?” and said that “In the end she said, ‘Yes, it is rape but I don’t know what to say’ and then just burst into tears”. She said, “I am just so stunned, I can’t believe he would do this to me”. She went on to say to Ms Young, “What will I do if I am pregnant? I don’t want a child and I definitely don’t want a child to Russell”.  
     
      
    8    The appellant’s account was, essentially, that the complainant came to the flat that evening, they were talking and at about 10 o’clock, he asked her if she wanted to stay the night and she said that she did and then consensual sexual intercourse took place on the bed in the bedroom. About twenty minutes later she said to him, “We shouldn’t have done that” and then got out of bed, got dressed and left. He denied saying that he wanted to get the complainant pregnant, that he wanted her to have his baby and that he loved her.  
     
      
    9    It was the sexual intercourse which occurred on this occasion which gave rise to the first count in the indictment. 
     
      
    10    His Honour undertook in his directions to the jury a somewhat curious course relating to the evidence of Janys Young. After briefly setting out the counts in the indictment and the occasions to which they referred, giving directions as to the onus and standard of proof and the elements of the offences, pointing out that the accused did not need to give evidence and that by doing so the onus of proof was not thereby changed, his Honour gave what he described as “the first set of directions [that] relate to the reliability of evidence” and then referred to a number of inconsistent statements made by several of the witnesses. He then said - 
     
      
       
        
        “The following evidence of Janys Young that Fiona Field told her that the accused had ‘sexually assaulted me, I’m really scared, I could be pregnant’, may be unreliable, and I warn you of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it, because the complainant’s evidence followed Ms Young asking her, ‘did he rape you?’ which, of course, was as you have heard elsewhere in this trial, a leading question.” 
        
       
      
    11    This direction, with respect, was somewhat confused. It suggested that the evidence of Ms Young might be unreliable, whereas the real point was that the allegation of rape made by the complainant might be unreliable because it had been elicited after leading questions. Indeed, as I have pointed out, the evidence of Ms Young was substantially not that it took only one leading question to elicit the allegation of rape but that the complainant was reluctant to make the allegation at all. The significance of this evidence was that the jury needed to evaluate whether the complainant’s allegations that she was raped were true in light of her reluctance to make the allegation to her flatmate. The point about evidence of this kind, of course, is that if the complaint is consistent with the evidence of the complainant, then the Crown is permitted to point to that fact as supportive of her credit. On the other hand, if there is a significant inconsistency, the jury must consider whether it regards the sworn testimony as reliable. In this respect, the learned trial Judge pointed out the first of these uses of the evidence when reading out the evidence of Ms Young which I have set out in summary above. His Honour did not at any stage explain to the jury the second use to which the evidence of Ms Young could be put.  
     
      
    12    The evidence of the complainant was that in the weeks following this act of intercourse, she discovered that she was pregnant and was unhappy as a result. Some months later, on Christmas Day, she told her father that she was pregnant by the appellant but that he “forced me and I fell pregnant”. 
     
      
    13    The complainant told the jury that, as she was having the appellant’s child, she thought that they “might as well try and work things out”, adding, “he sort of gave me the impression that no one else would want me anyway so...I pretty much just stayed with him”. The prosecutor asked the complainant what she meant by this evidence. The complainant, in effect, said that she stayed with him, despite his violence towards her including attempts to suffocate her by putting a pillow on her head, because she thought he would “change and maybe he’d be decent”.  
     
      
    14    This evidence was objected to as not relevant to the counts in the indictment but no ruling is apparent on the transcript. Nevertheless, the learned trial judge permitted the evidence to be given since the Crown prosecutor went on to seek details of the appellant’s behaviour. In brief, she said that at times the appellant would be nice but that at times he would be violent, bashing her head against the cupboard in his room, putting pillows on her head, strangling her, punching her in the stomach, even when she was pregnant, causing her to fall on the floor. This evidence, of course, was highly prejudicial. After it had been given, and carefully noted down by the trial judge, his Honour asked the prosecutor whether any of the matters related to any of the counts. The Crown prosecutor informed his Honour that they did not. The prosecutor submitted that the evidence was led to put the whole of the relationship of the complainant and the appellant before the jury to provide a context for the individual counts in the indictment.  
     
      
    15    In effect, the learned trial judge intimated that he would permit the evidence although there would be some limit because its prejudice could exceed its probative value. Defence counsel said that he “might leave it in the hands of the Crown at this stage” in the hope that, as the Crown had indicated, “it’s about to come to an end”. Regrettably, this was not only not the end, it was the beginning. His Honour invited defence counsel to raise a further objection at a later stage if he thought it necessary. I will deal at a later stage with defence counsel’s explanation in this court for the passive role he appears to have adopted. 
     
      
    16    It is not easy to discern what was meant by “context” in this submission. The counts in the indictment each occurred in its own factual setting which (as is shown below) provided an adequate context in which to evaluate and understand the allegation charged. The learned trial judge referred to, and apparently relied on, the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 at 515, where his Honour, referring to evidence of sexual activity other than that charged, considered that it may be relevant as evidencing a “guilty passion” or “sexual relationship”, or as necessary “in order to assist the jury to appreciate the full significance of what would otherwise appear to be an isolated act occurring without any apparent reason”. However, in the next paragraph of the Chief Judge at Common Law’s judgment, his Honour said (references omitted) - 
     
      
       
        
        “Evidence of sexual activity between the complainant and the accused other than that which is the subject of the charge is nevertheless frequently of a highly prejudicial nature, in that it tends to show a propensity on the part of the accused to commit crimes of the nature charged or crimes of a similar nature. Its admissibility has therefore always been subject to the well known discretion in criminal trials to exclude evidence where its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect ...If the judge declines to exercise that discretion to exclude the evidence of such other sexual activity, an explanation should invariably be given to the jury - as soon as the first of that evidence is given and, if necessary, again in the summing-up - as to the purpose for which the evidence is admitted, together with a warning to the jury that they must not either substitute evidence of such other sexual activity for the specific activity which is the subject of the offence charged or reason that, because the accused may have done something wrong with the complainant on some other occasion or occasions, he must also have done so on the occasion which is the subject of the offence charged.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour went on to say (30 NSWLR at 522) - 
       
       
        
        “So far as concerns the...the discretion to reject the evidence upon the basis that its probative weight is outweighed by its prejudicial effect..., the stage will inevitably be reached where the evidence of other sexual activity between the complainant and the accused will no longer reasonably be required either to establish the guilty passion (or the sexual desire or feelings) of the accused for the complainant or to place the evidence of the offence charged into a true and realistic context, and it does little or no more than emphasise that the accused has a propensity for committing crimes of the nature charged or crimes of a similar nature. When that stage has been reached, trial judges should be firm in excluding the evidence tendered.” 
        
       
       
      I set out the directions of the trial judge concerning this “context” evidence at a later stage. It is sufficient to point out here that there was no warning given by his Honour when the evidence was admitted, either at this stage or at any other stage during the trial, and the directions did not tell the jury that it must not use the evidence as “tendency” or “propensity”. 
       
      
    17    In B v The Queen (1992) 175 CLR 599, Dawson and Gaudron JJ said at 619 -  
     
      
       
        
        “Where, in a criminal case, [the trial judge] admits evidence admissible for one purpose but inadmissible for another - as he is ordinarily bound to do - he should direct the jury that they must not use the evidence for the purpose for which it is inadmissible, particularly where the use of the evidence for that purpose would be adverse to the accused.” 
        
       
       
      Reference might also be made to  
      BRS v The Queen 
       (1997) 191 CLR 275 at 295, 301 (where Gaudron J, citing the above passage from  
      B 
      , added, “Certainly, a direction of that kind must be given to avoid a perceptible risk of injustice”), 305, 321;  
      Gipp v The Queen 
       (1998) 194 CLR 106 at 155-6, 164. At 194 CLR 168, Callinan J said that he “would not accept that non-specific highly prejudicial evidence may be led by the prosecution, and juries told that it might provide ‘part of the essential background’ against which the other evidence is to be evaluated”. See also  
      R v MM 
       [2000] NSWCCA 78, esp per Powell JA at [46]-[49].  
       
      
    18    Where it is proposed to lead evidence of other offences as “context” it is essential that those offences be as precisely defined as possible as to time, place and character. The complainant should not be simply invited to make general allegations. The Crown prosecutor and, for that matter, the trial judge have a responsibility to ensure that all such evidence is elicited in such a way as will permit its true significance to be appropriately weighed in relation to the offences actually charged. The approach of the Crown prosecutor in this case was calculated to obscure, rather than clarify, the matters which were supposed to comprise context. Without precision and an appropriate measure of control, the task of assessing relevance and probative worth, which must be considered in relation to each substantial allegation of uncharged crimes, is impossible. It creates serious problems for the defence, both in making proper submissions on admissibility and responding with any evidence which might be available. It may be that more than the mere denial of the accused, which often sounds rather lame and inadequate, can be presented and, in fairness, ought to be adduced. This creates the real risk that the trial will be deflected from a consideration of the charges in the indictment to a substantial litigation about secondary issues. With respect, it seems to me that, rather than actually conducting this crucial assessment, the learned trial judge simply accepted the Crown prosecutor’s blandishments about admissibility. I say this because the material upon which the submission was based was completely lacking in the precision necessary to enable adequate evaluation of its true significance and the consequences for the conduct of the trial of its admission. 
     
      
    19    I leave aside any suggestion that the prosecution selected the allegations charged on the basis that they were “representative” incidents. This was never at any stage the approach of the prosecutor either at trial or in this Court. Again, the scope of the proposed evidence would have needed a great deal more clarity. At all events, I doubt that such an approach would be appropriate where the essence of the charges is non consensual sexual intercourse between adults, especially where consensual acts had also occurred.  
     
      
    20    The evidence adduced was not that of other sexual activity but of assaults, although it shortly after expanded to include other sexual activity. These assaults were not relied on in the Crown case - or, indeed, at any stage - to explain why the complainant “stayed with” the appellant after the initial sexual assault. The complainant said that she stayed despite them because she hoped for the appellant’s reformation. Not only was it highly prejudicial, but, in my opinion, it was not probative of the allegations in any of the counts in the indictment. There was no balance to be struck by the trial judge. The evidence was simply irrelevant. As the complainant herself conceded, there were a large number of consensual (though, she alleged, reluctant) acts of sexual intercourse between her and the appellant as well as, she alleged, a large number of assaults. This evidence might have described a social phenomenon but it made it virtually impossible, as it turned out, to focus the evidence on the charges alleged in the indictment, which occurred, essentially, only on four different occasions. This was not a case like that considered in R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359, where the Crown case was that the fact that there had been no protest made by the complainant on the occasions when she was allegedly sexually assaulted by the accused was explained by the history of violence inflicted on her by him and that this also demonstrated that the accused knew that the complainant had not consented to the acts in question. The history of violence in that case that characterised the relationship between the complainant and the accused was therefore directly relevant to the issues in the trial. 
     
      
    21    Most of the “context” evidence (and I refer to more such material below) was duly read out to the jury in his Honour’s summary of the Crown case. The only assistance that the jury received concerning it was at the commencement of the summing up - 
     
      
       
        
        “I turn now to what was described by, at least the Crown I think, as relationship evidence, concerning events that were not the subject of the charges. Of course, the Crown must identify specific acts and occasions for each count in the indictment and it must prove those particular acts and not some other acts on other occasions, that is fundamental to this case, that does not, however, mean that you may not take into account some wider history of the relationship between the complainant and the accused, if you find it proven.  
         
          
         
        There is evidence that other acts occurred during the course of their relationship and other evidence that filled in gaps between the various counts during the period of their relationship. You do not substitute these other acts for those charged in the indictment. This evidence is admissible in this case to enable you, the jury, to assess and evaluate the evidence upon which the Crown relies within a realistic conceptual setting.” 
        
       
      
    22    The final phrase may well have been misunderstood by the jury. It may have thought that the judge considered that the “relationship” evidence was itself “realistic”, that is to say, likely to be reliable. However, in my view, it did not provide such a setting in the circumstances of the case. There was evidence of a large number of sexual and non sexual assaults, very few of which were the subject of charges. In summarising the evidence, the trial judge did not identify that evidence which was “relationship” and that which was evidence of the charges in the indictment. Consideration of the crucial question, whether the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the assaults which were charged occurred, was not made any easier or more “realistic” by the evidence (if accepted) that many other offences were committed which were definitely not charged, unless the evidence was demonstrative of propensity, which could not be used in proof of the counts in the indictment. Indeed, even if the appellant did have a propensity to assault the complainant, that, of course, would not establish whether the assaults charged had actually occurred. The learned trial judge did not warn the jury, either at the stage of admission or when the jury were reminded of the evidence in the course of the trial judge’s summing up, that the appellant’s apparent propensity for violence and sexual assaults (if the complainant’s evidence as to these matters be accepted) must not be used in proof of his guilt of the charges in the indictment. In my view, the direction that the evidence was evidence of the relationship between the complainant and the appellant without such a warning would almost inevitably have led the jury to suppose that it might be used to conclude that the offences were but examples of typically violent assaults, sexual and otherwise, which the appellant had a propensity for committing and to move from that conclusion to accepting more readily that he had committed the offences in the indictment. 
     
      
    23    On resumption, the complainant said that she had mentioned “the main things I remember...there’s been so many he’s done”. She said that there were times when he had hurt her and she said to him that she thought she was going to die as a result. She said that although he hit her a lot whilst she was pregnant, the blow to the stomach which had caused her to fall to the ground (comprising count 2) occurred two weeks after she had given birth to their son, Stephen. The prosecutor then elicited evidence concerning the relationship between the appellant and the complainant in the ensuing period. She said that he was continuously violent towards her, slapping, punching, twisting her wrists, locking the door to his unit so she could not leave, and the like. She said, nevertheless, that she continued to visit him with Stephen because she “wanted him to be a part of my son’s life at that time”. She added, “I thought too, he raped me, he should help me to bring up this child, and I was really pretty much just trying to make a go of it. I wanted Stephen to know his Dad at that stage”. She said that the appellant would apologise to her all the time, that they would argue all the time and that she was very angry with him. She said that they would see each other frequently, sometimes daily. She said that when he hit her, he would lock the door and not let her use the phone. She said that if he hit her, he would say to her that she could not leave until she stopped crying, “because people will know something is wrong”. She said that she was reluctant to “take anything out” (I think this is a reference to an apprehended violence order (AVO)) because the appellant had guns and knives in his possession and she was frightened that “it would make things worse”. 
     
      
    24    Although the fact that the complainant eventually took out an AVO may have been relevant, since a number of the offences occurred despite it and a number of relevant communications involved its imposition, the reason for not taking it out before she did so was of only marginal, if any relevance. The defence sought to make something of this delay but that was responsive to the evidence which had been elicited by the Crown in chief: see Gipp, 194 CLR at 113, per Gaudron J as to the Crown pre-empting the defence case. It is not appropriate to elicit evidence of this kind which is prima facie inadmissible and leave it to the defence to object to discover whether delay in taking particular steps is an issue. This places the defence in the position of suggesting to the jury that the accused is attempting to conceal evidence that the Crown prosecutor thinks should be before it.  
     
      
    25    In my view, there was no basis for permitting the evidence concerning guns and knives to be adduced, whether as relationship or context. Moreover, except for the evidence as to the assault alleged in the second count, the evidence as to other assaults was irrelevant. The appellant was not charged with them, the evidence was so general as to make it impossible to evaluate its contextual relevance and it did not make the assault charged more understandable. It was highly prejudicial.  
     
      
    26    The complainant said that the events forming the third, fourth and fifth counts arose in December 1995 when she went to speak with the appellant about taking out an AVO. She said that the appellant, in effect, wanted to attempt to restore their relationship but she told him it was impossible. She said that she had a dizzy spell and crouched on the floor, feeling sick, that the appellant came up behind her and was rubbing against her as if he wanted to have sex, but she told him to get away and she wasn’t feeling well, that she went and lay on the bed in his bedroom for a while, that he came in, and started touching her, despite her protests that she was feeling sick and that at this time he put his fingers inside her vagina a couple of times, despite her telling him to stop. These acts comprised count 3 in the indictment.  
     
      
    27    The appellant then left the room, the complainant went to sleep for a little while. The appellant returned naked and started to undress the complainant as she woke up. Despite her protests, he had sex with her. Eventually she managed to push him off. This act comprised the fourth count. After this, the complainant rolled over to make it difficult for him to continue, but he again had sexual intercourse with her, threatening her as she struggled. She said - 
     
      
       
        
        “When I got him off that time he said to me - I was struggling around and that and he said to me, ‘If you don't stop it you'll get it up your backside’, that's what he used to say. I didn't want it there so I just let it go...”  
        
       
      
    28    The complainant added that she screamed at him when he got off her, she hit him in the chest and was very angry with him. The appellant apologised. The telephone rang and it was answered by the appellant. Ms Young called and asked to speak to the complainant who said that she mentioned something about the AVO and said she was going home shortly. As the complainant got to the door, the appellant told her that “an AVO is not going to stop me” and hit her nose, causing it to bleed, although the complainant said that she did not think he meant it. This blow comprised the fifth count. 
     
      
    29    The complainant’s comment about the threat of anal intercourse, that it was “what he used to say” was irrelevant and extremely prejudicial. It was not alleged that it was said in connection with any other charge.  
     
      
    30    The complainant drove from the appellant’s premises to Granville Police Station but only mentioned the assault and did not refer to the sexual assault as she was somewhat embarrassed. The complainant also spoke to Ms Young, who said she noticed the blood on her nose and bruises on her thighs, and said the complainant had told her that the appellant had tried to force her to have sex with him adding, “I’m sick of this, he never gives up”. This fell well short of an allegation of rape. The complainant said that she had told Ms Young that the appellant had hit her but did not recall if she said anything about the sexual assault because, “it was just embarrassing”. Similarly, she rang her father to tell him about the blow to the nose but again not about the sexual assault. Since her evidence was that she was uncertain whether the appellant’s striking her on the nose was intentional, the terms of the complaint to her flatmate and to her father might be thought to be somewhat surprising. The complainant said that she went to the medical centre and told a doctor that she had been hit and sexually assaulted and then made a police statement about what happened, describing both assaults. She was examined at Westmead Hospital where her nose and the bruises on her thighs were examined.  
     
      
    31    Following these events the appellant, according to the complainant, telephoned her frequently and she decided that she would go up to Belmont, near Newcastle. An interim AVO had been taken out on 5 December 1995, the day after the assaults. A further order was taken out the following week. The essence of the complainant’s evidence as to what was happening at this time, is contained in the following - 
     
      
       
        
        “Crown Prosecutor: Q And have you told us why you moved up there? 
         
        A Yeah, I just - I had enough of all the phone calls, it was just - I was just so confused, I didn’t know what was - he was ringing me, I’d see him and then we would talk and then I’d say to him, ‘We shouldn’t be talking.’ And I just got sick of the whole thing and the phone was ringing, like I said, non-stop, I felt fearful you know, as I say he’s - has firearms and things and he’s told me that he could get access to them, I’ve seen them at his house anyway and that sort of frightened me. So we left.” 
        
       
      
    32    No objection was taken to any of this evidence.  
     
      
    33    In early February, the complainant said she had been told by her father that the appellant had been ringing him and her flatmate and said that he knew where she was. She said that she panicked and travelled back to Sydney to stay with her family. The complainant said that she rang the appellant and asked him to stop harassing her family and friends and alleged that the appellant wanted her to come and see him, saying that he was going to kill himself if she did not, that he had a knife and was going to put it through his stomach. The complainant said that she did not want him to hurt himself and she decided to go to see him. In the circumstances, especially having regard to the allegations made by the complainant both before and after this evidence, this seems not a little odd. The complainant said that, although the appellant did have a knife, “he had no intention of putting it through his stomach”. He seemed happy to see her and she and the appellant engaged in conversation and talked for much of the night. The complainant spent the night at the unit with the appellant sleeping in another bed. She said that this did not bother her. In the morning, however, the appellant locked the door so that she could not leave but, when he left to go to court, she did so. She also went to court and spoke to a police officer, saying that she had gone to his unit and knew that she should not have done so.  
     
      
    34    The complainant returned to Belmont. Whilst there, a number of telephone conversations occurred between her and the appellant concerning access to Stephen and possible adjustments to the AVO to enable this to occur. The appellant, shortly after, arrived at the complainant’s Belmont premises. He stayed for several days before being ultimately arrested. It was during this time that the occasions giving rise to counts 6, 7 and 8 in the indictment allegedly occurred. Count 6 was an assault occasioned by the appellant head-butting the complainant whilst they were in bed, counts 7 and 8 comprised two occasions of vaginal intercourse. The complainant said that on the same occasion as count 8 the appellant committed anal intercourse with her which caused her to bleed, but this was not the subject of a separate count in the indictment.  
     
      
    35    The complainant was asked by the prosecutor why she did not tell the appellant to leave after he had first arrived and been at the unit for some hours. She said - 
     
      
       
        
         
        “How could I force him to leave? I mean just when you get - like if I have a go at him or that, he’s just going to hit me like he has before. We’d just fight and my son was there and as I later found out, he had big knives in his bag, you know...I found that out after he left, like who knows what would have happened, so I was not going to mess with him.” 
        
       
       
      Later on, the complainant was asked by the Crown prosecutor why she let him stay in her unit at Belmont until his arrest. She answered - 
       
       
        
        “It’s not exactly let him stay, I mean as I say I can’t - I wouldn’t have been big enough to physically - I was slimmer then, I wouldn’t have been big enough to physically force him out the door. As I said when he first came I did - I thought that he was wanting to work things out and I spoke to him about the AVO, I said I’d see a solicitor for him about giving him access to Stephen. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. To give him access to Stephen? 
         
        A. Yes. I always, all along I wanted that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you want him to have access to Stephen? 
         
        A. Because I wanted my son to know his father... 
        
       
       
        
        Crown Prosecutor: Q. You said you had these conversations with him where he wanted to work things out? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q What was that about, work what out? 
         
        A. Just to make it amicable, like none of this - like as I say, he was driving me mad, that’s why I left Sydney, I was a raving rat, I just couldn’t take it any more, I was - I was going made from it all. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was happening to you? 
         
        A. Back in Sydney before I moved? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes. 
         
        A. The things I said before, the assaults, the handcuffing, he had - I don’t know if I mentioned he had handcuffs, he used to cuff me, my hands together or to the bed and he’d tell me that I enjoyed everything and a lot of times I wanted to go to the police and Russell would say to me ‘Oh you better not do that.’ And ‘If you do I’ll drag you down.’ And he at that stage said to me that no one would believe and I believed it as well and he - there was also a time when my son was first born and Russell said that I was getting fat and I’d only just given birth and so I started starving and I became anorexic for a time there and had to get treatment. It was all just too much. And he took my son off me on one occasion. He went with another woman and they locked me out of the house and he refused to give my son back. Four days after my son was born. The only reason I got him back I was breastfeeding and I needed to get him and I rang the police and they came and went in and got my son. And I asked Russell why did he do that to me and he said he was sorry and he didn’t know why he did it. I think on that night they were alleging that I was just mad and I shouldn’t have a child and -- 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: I’m sorry, you can’t tell us what other people thought? 
         
        A. I’m sorry. 
        
       
       
        
        Crown Prosecutor: Q When you say they did that include the accused? 
         
        A. Russell and Liz - the lady that he went with. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did the accused say to you on that night? 
         
        A. Russell, all Russell said to me was he was really sorry that he did it and he didn’t know why he - ‘I don’t know why I did it.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Q And how old was Stephen? 
         
        A. Four days old, he was tiny. And so after that I went and got custody of him, I went straight and saw a chamber magistrate-- 
        
       
       
        
      Q. Did you get custody of Stephen formally? 
       
       A. Yes I did. 
       
       
        
        Q. And did you have any arrangements with the accused, formal arrangements-- 
        
       
        
      A. Yes. 
       
       
       Q. About having access to Stephen? 
       
        
        A. I showed him the - Russell the paperwork-- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When was this? 
         
        A. Not long after they took the baby from me. I was really angry and I thought well this isn’t happening again so it was only - it would be a few days after that.” 
         
        
       
      
    36    This evidence was followed by a large number of questions about the complainant’s attempts to get her child back, concluding with the following - 
     
      
       
        
        “Crown Prosecutor: Q. And when did you get Stephen back? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That night. I went to the house and I knocked on the door and the lady there was going crazy, ‘you’re not having your son’ and Russell stood inside with her and they locked the door on me and I remember it was really cold and I didn’t know what to do. I was sitting out in the car freezing and I went bashing on neighbours doors trying to get someone that would let me in. People didn’t want to sort of get involved and then one family let me in and I told them they won’t give my baby back, so they let me ring the police. The police from Merrylands came down and they spoke to Russell and Liz Skinner and then they spoke to me and I was very annoyed and in the end they said to Russell ‘you can’t keep the baby, you know, give the baby back to her.’ 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: Q. How old was the baby? 
        
       
      A. Four days old.” 
       
       
      This evidence had only the slightest, if any, relevance to any issues in the trial. It was highly prejudicial. I do not see how it could fairly be regarded as providing an essential context for any of the charges, let alone those that occurred at Belmont. Since the witness herself said that she was prepared to negotiate with the appellant concerning access to her son and for that purpose to negotiate some change to the terms of the AVO shortly before the offences which occurred in Belmont, the possible relevance of this material, that it demonstrated that she would be most unlikely to have invited the appellant to Belmont as he alleged, was removed. No objection was taken to it. Other prejudicial statements were made by the complainant, for example, immediately before the events giving rise to count 8, the complainant said, - 
       
       
        
        “I was sitting on my bed and Russell came and like kneeled across me and he lifted up my singlet top and my cossie and he started like trying to suck my breasts. He said that he was - made a comment about trying to get me off, like when I was breastfeeding, cause when I was breastfeeding he always used to ask me could he do that I would say, ‘Get lost.’ And I pushed his head away and he kept trying to do it and I just kept pushing him and he pulled his pants down a little, he still had the same clothes on and he pulled his pants down a little and like I was fighting him off. Like I said he was heaps heavy then, he wasn’t like - and yeah, and pulled my cossie bottoms down and –” 
        
       
       
      The comment of the complainant about the appellant’s approaches when she was breastfeeding was immaterial. 
       
      
    37    During cross-examination, the complainant took a combative approach to the appellant’s counsel. Thus, within the first few minutes the following appears - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And its the case, isn’t it, that after then, after you did your work experience you came in contact with Mr Marsh it seems by way of acquaintance that you, as it were, ran across him in the street, is that fair to say or not, after your work experience? 
         
        A. I saw him in the streets a couple of times and then I rang the station and he answered on another matter.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. You rang Flemington Station did you? 
         
        A. Rang, or attended, yes, and Russell - I attended one time, Russell was there, he was drunk on duty and he - 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He was? 
         
        A. Drunk on duty.”  
        
       
      
    38    Counsel compounded this problem, however, by asking the complainant how she could tell that the appellant was drunk and got the answer - 
     
      
       
        
        “A. He told me, ‘I was hitting the piss last night’, he stunk of alcohol, he was putting his feet on the table, he was carrying on just stupid.” 
        
       
       
      A few minutes further on the following appears - 
       
       
        
        “Q. I’m suggesting to you from the outset that you were desirous of having a child and you let the accused know? 
         
        A. That’s definitely, definitely not true, no, I especially wouldn’t choose him to father my child, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You wouldn’t choose him to father your child? 
         
        A. No, he was fat, overweight, alcoholic, he was mad back then, he had guns, he used to bash me, why would I want him?” 
        
       
       
      Of course, none of these alleged deficits, with the exception of the first three, had become apparent by the time of the first assault. Having regard to the complainant’s evidence in chief that she “used to feel sorry for him” and “I had no attraction to him, he was a lot older than me”, and that even after she had been raped she “just felt sorry for him...and then thought we’d just stay friends” together with the evidence that there were no assaults before September 1994, this answer was somewhat unexpected. When counsel, a few questions later, put it to the complainant that the appellant had never assaulted her and asked what was admittedly and, perhaps, foolishly, an open ended question, “What do you say about that?” the complainant responded with, “I disagree, he smashed me on the back of the head one time and I nearly passed out on the floor”, an allegation which had not hitherto surfaced. The complainant’s evidence was that sexual intercourse took place many times between her and the appellant and it was not the Crown case that each of these occasions either was, or involved, an assault. 
       
      
    39    In dealing, early in the cross-examination, with the complainant’s telephone conversations with the appellant before the September 1994 incident, counsel asked - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. But you rang him, you’ve indicated, is that right? 
         
        A. He rang my house every day he was ringing - I had to ring his inspector and ask him to stop calling me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You rang Mr Marsh’s inspector -- 
         
        A. And they said he was mad, he was playing Russian roulette with his service revolver, they already knew, they had had to take it from him...” 
        
       
       
      This, again, was completely unresponsive. Counsel simply continued with his cross-examination. In dealing with the first incident, counsel asked - 
       
       
        
        “Q. And is it the case that as soon as you arrived there, he’s come out, as you’ve described, ‘I want you to have my baby, I love you’ -- 
         
        A. Yes, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. As soon as you arrived there? 
         
        A. He always used to say that, he was crazy with that, he was obsessed with - he likes women notches on his belt, I found out. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He didn’t - I didn’t hear the last part? 
         
        A. I said he likes, it’s a notch on his belt, another notch on his belt, that’s all it was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In respect of what? 
         
        A. Getting me pregnant. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Getting you pregnant was a notch on his belt? 
         
        A. Yes, I found out more about Mr Marsh since this and that’s what it was, yes.” 
        
       
      
    40    Shortly after this evidence, counsel questioned the complainant about when she complained to her father of the sexual assault as a result of which she became pregnant and elicited that he had said to her that he knew the appellant would be trouble and she should have an abortion. Counsel proceeded - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And of course you did not have an abortion? 
         
        A. That was three months, I was three months pregnant by that time -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. and the reality is -- 
        
       
       
        
        Objection: Should be allowed to finish that answer. 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour. Q. Yes, did you have anything to add? 
         
        A. Yes your Honour. I was three months pregnant by that stage, I hadn’t had anyone to confide in afterwards, and I don’t have a mother around to go and say, well I am pregnant, you know, what do I do. By the time I old my father I was three months pregnant, they had already showed me the little ultra sound at Westmead, and I couldn’t have an abortion. Russell put a lot of pressure on me not to have an abortion, he came around one night, I had to call the police, he was threatening with violence, he was drunk. 
        
       
       
        
        Leybourne: Q When was that? 
         
        A. I don’t recall, Constable Jacobs came out. When I found out I was pregnant he was saying, ‘Don’t have an abortion Fee, I love you, I’ll stand by you, I’ll do everything for you, I’ll support you.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why didn’t you take a restraining order out then? 
         
        A. I was stupid, I really was, I should have, I should have. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The reality is, isn’t it Miss Field that Mr Marsh, was your partner as it were? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No, he was not, he was an acquaintance. Look, if I’d started making more trouble he told me he had guns, I’d seen knives at his house, he used to steal scalpels when we were down at the hospital, he’s weird. There was a fatal accident downstairs, he runs downstairs to take photos of the dead body. I mean - and you are telling me to take action against this man, I don’t think so. I was fearful at that stage.” 
         
        
       
      Except for the reference to guns and knives, this material had not been elicited in chief either generally as “context” or as an explanation for the delay in seeking an AVO. 
       
      
    41    Shortly after this counsel asked when, after the September 1994 sexual assault, was the next time she was assaulted or harassed by the accused. The complainant’s answer was - 
     
      
       
        
        “A. He used to hit me a lot. When I was pregnant I grabbed the keys of the flat and I ran, and I got out, and I ran up Merrylands Road and he tackled me. I was pregnant and he dragged me to the ground and dragged me back up to his house. It was all a game to him, he did it a lot.”  
        
       
      
    42    The complainant said that after she was pregnant for about five weeks, the appellant “was nice to me” but she just could not give an exact date of when he assaulted her again. Counsel attempted then to elicit what it was that occurred five weeks after the pregnancy when the appellant stopped being nice, but the complainant corrected him and said that she had meant that when, at five weeks, she found out that she was pregnant, the appellant was then being nice and she could not say “when he went nasty”. Counsel then asked - 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Q. Well, to the stage where he stopped being nice, what did he do from then on? 
         
        A. I’m just trying to think of the point where it did stop being nice.  
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: Well just take your time. 
         
        A. That you. Yeah, I think there wasn’t an actual point, just throughout my pregnancy when we’d discuss marriage and things, I’d get annoyed because I didn’t want to marry him, and I’d get a hit to the mouth or something like that, or if I didn’t-- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What stage was that, you see I’ve got a note here and I’ve just got lost - ‘when I knew I was pregnant he was being nice to me’, now how long after that was it that an incident, if any occurred, did occur? 
         
        A. He slapped me around a lot, I couldn’t be specific until after my son was born, the ones I mentioned after my son was born that were a bit more serious, but throughout my pregnancy, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did he do? 
         
        A. He used to hit me, he used to try and strangle, if I didn’t do what he wanted, he used to twist my arm back, he used to be in the Army before the police and used to do this pressure point think on my hand, said that he knew how to hurt me and he, yes, and I forget exactly how he did it, but it used to really hurt.” 
        
       
      
    43    Counsel attempted to explore the inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence concerning whether the appellant wished to marry her. The cross-examination took this form - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. I'd put to you that in conjunction with this engagement ring that was spoken of that a number of times prior, in the latter stages of pregnancy, that you indicated to Russell Marsh that you wanted to get married?  
         
        A. No. I had every opportunity. After my son was born I did put it on him when things went bad I said, ""Oh would you still marry me now?"", you know things had gone bad and I realised at that point it had all just been a set-up, he'd never had any intention of anything. But as I say I have plenty of cards to prove that he wanted to marry me. If I wanted to I could have. I did not want to.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. You said at some stage you could prove it was a set-up, is that right?  
         
        A. No, I started feeling that it had all been a set-up after my son was born and things went really bad and I used to say things to him like, ‘It was all bull wasn't it.’ You know, ""You never - this is just a set-up, you just set out to get me pregnant and you never had any intention of marriage or moving in, it was just to con me. 
        
       
       
        
        ... 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And the con was to get you pregnant? 
         
        A. No, just being manipulative, trying to act the nice guy, marry me, marry me, I’ll be there for you, I’ll help you with the child-- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Stopping you there is I could, are you suggesting by a con or set-up that Mr Marsh was to gain a benefit from this? 
         
        A. Oh he wanted a child, yes. I found out things, he loves making children with different people.” 
        
       
      
    44    I might add that the complainant said that, in April and May 1995, in the latter stages of her pregnancy with Stephen, she considered that she and the appellant were friends.  
     
      
    45    Taking up some earlier evidence from the witness, counsel suggested to her that on her evidence there was a break in assaults from the time of Stephen’s birth for approximately six weeks. This was objected to as not representing her evidence and the learned trial judge said to counsel that this was not what the witness had said but rather that the appellant had assaulted her a fortnight after the birth, to which the complainant added without any further question, “Yes, and raped me a fortnight after”, an allegation made in evidence for the first time. The complainant’s earlier evidence had certainly been that the next assault following the birth of her son occurred fourteen days later. Counsel put the following - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. When Stephen was born, I understand 25 or 26 June ’95 -- 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. --that for the next 14 days thereabouts there was no violence, he did not assault you? 
         
        A. Yes he did, two weeks after, he punched me in the stomach, he had sex with me two weeks later, he made me bleed. I was telling him it was painful on the lounge at Bennalong Street. I went to the doctor who said I had miscarriage, I was haemorrhaging and everything from him having sex with me so soon.” 
        
       
       
      This was not responsive. Counsel had not suggested there was no violence, nor did he ask what had occurred. 
       
       
      The point of these questions perhaps was shown by counsel’s next question - 
       
        
        “Q. And of course it still remains the fact, doesn’t it, putting aside what you’ve said, it’s still early December of 1995 before you even seek a restraining order? 
        
       
        
      A. That is true.” 
       
      
    46    A conversation which occurred in late 1995 between the appellant and the complainant was tape recorded by him and part of that conversation was put to the complainant. The clear thrust of it was that she was berating the appellant for not marrying her. I pass over the apparent illogicality of her explanation for these statements, which certainly did not add to the complainant’s credibility. Counsel asked - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. He’d pursued you wanting to get married? 
         
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And then at what point did he not want to marry you? 
         
        A. I don’t know if he - I actually said to him, see there were many conversations - this is one of many, and he’s picked out the most incriminating for me. Yeah, but he did want to marry me, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It is incriminating, isn’t it? 
         
        A. We have - I have things that are in my favour too, there’s a lot to come yet.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. And I’d ask in respect to that matter, you’d agree wouldn’t you that you wanted him to marry you -- 
         
        A. No, no. No. There was a previous conversation where I’d put it on him, just bluffing him, ‘I’ll move in with you now. I’ll marry you now’. Just trying to test him out, and he died, he was just like, oh no, and I realised then that he’d pursued me, got me pregnant and then I was worthless. I don’t find this totally incriminating because you can see it’s sheer frustration, if you can read between the lines, I’d just had enough.” 
        
       
       
      Counsel quoted a comment by the complainant which suggested (rightly, in my opinion) that in fact she did wish to “become involved with him, but he’s rejecting you, is that right?” 
       
       
        
        “A. No. I don’t know about this rejection, I said to him, ‘I’ll move in with you’ and I was just bluffing you know, testing him and I realised as I said at that stage he’d never wanted - he just set me up to get me pregnant and I was furious. He destroyed my life, I said that in there, ‘You’ve ruined my life, you wanted the baby’. 
        
       
       
        
        A. And...he says, ‘how many times have I tried - have I try and get you to move in’? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Exactly, and I didn’t want to. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you said, ‘Yeah, well I told you that that ain’t good enough’. I’m suggesting to you, you wanted to marry him? 
         
        A. No, I had plenty of opportunity had I wanted to marry this man. I started to find out things about him that were just unbelievable and I wouldn’t want to be with a man like that. And I hate the fact that I even had a child to a man like that.” 
        
       
      
    47    The complainant then said that the appellant had been threatening her and the following ensued - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. He did not threaten you, do you agree with that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, he did, he said he’d bring me down if I said anything because there are things in my past that wouldn’t sound too good, he said, ‘I’ll drag you down if you ever-- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you were very-- 
         
        OBJECTION  
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Do you have anything further on that? 
         
        A. Just basically about he said he’d bring me down and he had firearms and then he could get access to them and I’d be best to keep my mouth shut.” 
        
       
       
      Of course, this opened up the question of guns, which simply went from bad to worse -  
       
        
        “Leybourne: Q. It is the fact, isn’t it that when Mr Marsh was a serving police officer that in mid, approximately mid-1995 that he displaced himself of his guns, he gave his guns away, don't you agree with that?  
         
        A. All I know about the firearms is the police took them from him, he came to my home very drunk one night threatening, begging me not to have an abortion, Granville police took his firearms from him, there was a ton of them in the back of the car, we went and got them back, that was the last I heard he had them, I don't know what happened from there on.  
        
       
      
      
     
      
       
        
        Q. I am trying to put a time perspective on this because this conversation October/November and you get your restraining order or interim order in early December. I'm suggesting as far back as June/July 1995 that he didn't have his guns?  
        
       
      
      
     
      
       
        
        OBJECTION.  
         
         A. There were firearms in the home.  
         
          
         
        HIS HONOUR: Just one moment. Just rephrase the question if you would.  
         
          
         
        LEYBOURNE: Q. You have heard - I suggest to you it was mid-1995 that he did not have his guns, what do you say about that?  
         
        A. Mid-1995? As I said the last I saw of them he took them back to his home, I have no knowledge if he had them but he used to tell me that he could get them, he had a friend watching them on the phone conversations...I don’t know what happened from there on.” 
        
       
        
      
    48    The prosecution tendered by consent a statement from a Senior Constable of police which established that, on his arrest, the appellant had in his possession what is described as a dingo rescue knife and a black bear classic knife. Although this evidence was tendered by consent, its relevance to the issues in the trial was slight, since there was no suggestion that the complainant was aware of their presence or that the appellant threatened to use a knife. It simply underscored the complainant’s evidence that she was frightened of him and that this fear was justified by what was later found in the appellant’s possession. The complainant’s evidence about this matter was not admissible when it was given and its prejudicial nature was inappropriately emphasised by the tender of the officer’s statement which, of course, was with the jury during its deliberations.  
     
      
    49    The prosecutor called evidence without objection from Detective Senior Constable Martinsons of the allegations made by the complainant concerning the events of 4 December 1995. As I understand it, this evidence was admitted as evidence of complaint. The prosecutor also tendered, without objection, a statement in virtually identical terms as that of Constable Martinsons made by his offsider. I cannot see how this added to the case, except to give emphasis to an out of court statement by the complainant. There was no proper basis for its tender, the result of which was, of course, to give the jury access to it in the course of their deliberations. The police arranged for the complainant to be examined by a doctor. The doctor gave evidence without objection of the complaint and the written history tendered without objection together with the sexual assault kit. 
     
      
    50    Also tendered by the Crown was a hand written note made by the complainant concerning the appellant’s behaviour not only on the occasion on which she got pregnant, but subsequently. This note was left at the Granville Police Station on 1 December 1995. Parts were objected to. The note as tendered is set out below, with those parts admitted over objection (the actual extent of which, however, is not completely clear) in italics. The transcript does not reveal the basis for its tender or the rulings made by the learned trial judge.  
     
      
    51    Exhibit R -  
     
      
       
      * always bashing me during pregnancy 
       
      * raped and got pregnant - torn clothes 
       
      * punched in the stomach 2 weeks after Stephen was born.. 
       
      * knocked on the back of the head - slight concussion 
       
      * keys - tried to set me up 
       
      * tape recording me 
       
      * masturbating in front of Stephen  
       
      * refused to leave my home 
       
      * tried to force me into sex Wed night - bit me - again last night 
       
      * threatens to kill himself & me 
       
      * drinking again

      * took the baby from me - 5 days old 
       
      * tried to get me to kill myself in the car - he rigged it up 
       
      * I didn’t get him charged with anything because he always said no one would believe me over him because of my past and I believed him 
       
      *

      * got angry when I refused to marry him, said he’ll get me 
       
      * always threatens me but say I’m threatening him - makes people believe he’s the good guy 
       
        
      
    52    The mere fact that there was or may have been some dispute between the appellant and the complainant as to the matters referred to in the note should not have led to its admission under s 108(3)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995 (as submitted in this Court by the Crown prosecutor) since the note was not in any real sense probative the matter in issue, let alone any issue of relevance in the trial, whilst its prejudicial effect was overwhelming. Although some of these matters were referred to by the complainant in cross examination (a matter to which I will return), this was not true of all the allegations. As to the others, I do not see how that provided a proper basis for its admission. In order to admit a prior consistent statement under s 108(3)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995, leave is necessary. No leave appears to have been sought, nor is the requirement adverted to by the trial judge, let alone the matters required by s 192 of the Act to be considered before leave is granted. In my view, with the possible exception of the complaints concerning counts 1 and 2, the material in the note was entirely inadmissible. The other allegations were extremely prejudicial and the mere fact that the complainant had made them in writing was scarcely, if at all, probative. Moreover, they were either irrelevant or so peripheral to the issues in the trial as to substantially deflect the proper course of the trial from an appropriate consideration of the charges in the indictment if their resolution was thought by the jury to be important. The fact that the note was itself an exhibit gave these questions completely inappropriate prominence. In my opinion, the proper application of s 192 of the Evidence Act 1995 would have required exclusion of the note. 
     
      
    53    Exhibit S comprised the notebook entries made by Senior Constable Clapham on 1 December 1995. These reflected the following allegations made by the complainant: that she was raped by the appellant, as a result of which she fell pregnant; that she had been assaulted on several occasions on which at least two she required medical treatment; that she had twice observed him masturbating in front of Stephen; that he tape recorded conversations with her which he edited, threatened to hide his guns and “get” the complainant if she took out an AVO, frequently told the complainant that no one would believe her claims because of her past, frequently demanded sex and tried to force her to comply, bit her on the neck so that people would think it was a love bite, was drinking alcohol more and used to have a drinking problem and punched the complainant in the stomach two weeks after Stephen was born; that she feared that the welfare authorities would try to take Stephen “from them” if they knew of the situation or if an AVO was taken out; and that, if she moved, the appellant would access the police computer to get information to locate her, saying (however) that she didn’t think Stephen was in danger from the appellant and wanted the baby to be able to see his father. The note concluded with the complainant saying that she would return on 4 December with her father to make a statement with a view to applying for an AVO. 
     
      
    54    Defence counsel indicated that, subject to the rulings made as to the handwritten notes, Exhibit R, he had no objection to the tender of the entirety of the notebook. It is somewhat uncertain what counsel intended to convey by this concession but I think that, his objections to the contents of the note having been largely overruled, he was merely acknowledging that, by parity of reasoning, the same matters in the note book would be admitted. There was certainly no indication that he had withdrawn his objections to the admission of the matters earlier specified. I gather from an exchange between counsel and the learned trial judge that the basis for admission was whether the matter “came into evidence”. I cannot see how this provided an adequate ground for admitting documentary allegations of an extremely prejudicial kind and having only the most marginal, if any, relevance to the issues in the trial. Even if relevant and adequately probative, consideration should have been given to the appropriateness tendering the notes as distinct from reading them to the jury. For the same reasons as should have led to the rejection of the note, Exhibit R, the evidence in these notes should have been excluded and, certainly, the notebook should not have become an exhibit. 
     
      
    55    Also part of Exhibit S was another note made by Const Clapham on 4 December 1995, stating she had received a telephone call from the complainant to say that the complainant did not wish to make a statement because the appellant was very angry and she feared what he would do to her and the baby if an AVO was taken out and that she believed that he would shoot her. Const Clapham noted that the complainant sounded very distressed. She noted that the complainant said her flatmate was going away for three weeks and that she was scared of what might happen while she was be alone with Stephen. Tender of this part of the notebook was not objected to, but the basis of its admission was not articulated, at least in the transcript. I infer that it was tendered because evidence to the same effect had been given by the complainant. Again, I cannot see a proper basis for its tender. 
     
      
    56    The notebook also contained an account of an interview between the appellant and Inspector Teen on 10 January 1996 (following his arrest in Belmont) relating to an alleged breach of his AVO. There was discussion concerning the possession of firearms by the appellant including the appellant’s statements that he had given his firearms to a named police officer. I find it difficult to see how any of these notebook entries could be property admitted, although some were consented to; nor does there appear to be any relevance in the discussions concerning the firearms. Also tendered was a miscellaneous property receipt, showing that a large number of firearms was seized from the appellant on 8 November 1994 and returned to him on 10 September 1995. All this material was admitted without objection of counsel for the appellant. 
     
      
    57    The complainant was cross examined by defence counsel concerning certain conversations with a Ms Ainsworth with whom her father had a brief relationship. When counsel told the complainant that he proposed to ask her questions about a conversation with Ms Ainsworth, the complainant responded that it was all lies, that she had a falling out with her father, and that she “actually lived with a convicted serial rapist”. Undeterred, counsel suggested to her that she told Ms Ainsworth that the appellant did not rape her and that the allegations she had made against the appellant were “a setup” agreed between her and her father. The complainant denied this, saying that she had told Ms Ainsworth “everything he’d done to me, how he had abused me”. Counsel put it to the complainant that she told Ms Ainsworth that she had invited the appellant to Belmont, inveigled him into having sexual intercourse with her, started a fight and then alleged rape. This allegation was emphatically denied. The prosecutor, in re examination, elicited from the complainant, not only that she had told Ms Ainsworth of the events giving rise to the allegations in the indictment, but of a large number of other allegations, including that “he was a weirdo”, that he had attempted to get her to commit suicide, that, when she went into labour at the hospital he started to get an erection and said “he was turned on seeing me in so much pain”, that she “used to say thank God I never had a daughter, I wouldn’t let him near a little girl”. The suicide allegation had already been elicited by the Crown in re examination concerning a remark made by the complainant during a taped telephone conversation with the appellant - 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. How did you feel about the accused at the time of this conversation, Miss Field?  
         
        A. Very angry.  
         
          
         
        Q. And I think you told us the reasons why you were very angry?  
         
        A. Yes, I mean I wanted him to help with the baby and everything, but sometimes he'd come around and just start treating me bad so I would say just go, and I'd just say to him, ‘why can't you treat me decent?’, I always used to say that.  
         
          
         
        HIS HONOUR: Q. You say he came around and what?  
         
        A. He used to come around like I wanted him to help with the baby and everything, but he'd just start treating me bad or you know, like one day trying to convince me to gas myself in my flatmate's car, and I’d just say to him, ‘just go, you know, until you can treat me decent’.”  
        
       
       
      Following objection by defence counsel, the trial judge struck out the evidence concerning the car. When the allegation was repeated, in greater detail (the complainant adding that the appellant had actually attached a hose from the vacuum cleaner to the exhaust and into the car window, inviting her to “get in the car and kill myself”), defence counsel neither objected nor sought a discharge of the jury. The rest was new. None of this was admissible, despite defence counsel’s failure to object. It may have been proper to re examine the complainant about what she had told Ms Ainsworth concerning the matters put by defence counsel and, perhaps, the offences charged. This was just open slather. It could serve only to inflame the jury against the appellant. The trial had long since stopped being a trial of the issues posed by the indictment for determination. 
       
      
    58    The appellant tendered in this Court an affidavit by his counsel at trial. Amongst other the things, counsel said - 
     
      
       
        
        “The complainant quite often had a rapid fire type answer and she said things that were quite new to me and not responsive to the question. I realise now that I should have objected to, or had struck out, these answers or parts of answers, as they were prejudicial to the appellant, but at the time I thought that she was doing damage to herself.” 
        
       
      
    59    Counsel is placed in a difficult position when a witness makes an objectionable and prejudicial answer, whether to other counsel or him or herself. Objections may be perceived by the jury as attempts to conceal serious wrongdoing behind legal technicalities. Where the Crown prosecutor elicits such objectionable evidence, he or she should not leave it to defence counsel to object but has an independent duty to ensure that only admissible material is placed before the jury. Moreover, it is the duty of the Crown prosecutor to control the witness and ask questions directed to ensure, so far as is possible, that only such evidence is adduced. It will be seen from a number of the examples set out above that evidence was elicited from the complainant by the prosecutor that could not sensibly have been regarded as admissible. It is difficult to avoid the suspicion that the prosecutor was prepared to take forensic advantage of that material and, as a matter of tactics, place defence counsel in the position of attracting the obloquy of objecting. In this case the effect was the forensic equivalent of forcing him to drink from a fire hose. I read the passage in counsel’s affidavit as little more than reflecting the need to make a virtue out of necessity. However, he undoubtedly made things worse by himself asking open ended questions in cross-examination.  
     
      
    60    In order to raise here grounds of appeal depending on answers to questions not objected to, leave must be obtained: Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules: see R v Meier (unreported, NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 21 May 1996) per Gleeson CJ at 10. Leave will only be granted “where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings” (R v Tripodina (1988) 35 A Crim R 183) or “it is necessary to grant leave in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice”(R v Clarke (1995) 78 A Crim R 226 per Hunt CJ at CL at 230); see also R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536. 
     
      
    61    In R v Harvey (unreported, NSWCCA, 11 December 1996), Beazley JA, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said - 
     
      
       
        
        “The ‘essential requirement of the law’ relevant here is the requirement which is at the very heart of the criminal justice system, namely, that an accused person ‘have a fair trial according to law’:  
        R v Pemble 
         (1971) 124 CCR 107 per Barwick CJ at 117. See also  
        Stirland v DPP 
         [1944] AC 315 at 327. That requirement operates, where necessary, even in the face of deliberate decisions taken at trial: see  
        Meier 
         per Gleeson CJ at 19-20. This case could not be described as a strong Crown case. It depended very much on the jury's acceptance of the children's evidence. It is not apparent whether counsel's failure to object to this evidence was deliberate. It may have been that counsel, having been overruled on the objection taken earlier, felt constrained not to object further. It may be that he considered it was preferable to be as ‘low-key’ as possible on any questions that went to this issue, for fear of emphasising evidence which was adverse to his client. However, it is neither necessary to speculate as to the reason for counsel's failure nor to excuse him for the failure. The point at issue is different. It is whether the admission of the evidence was such as to amount to a miscarriage of justice such that, first, leave to raise the ground of appeal should be granted and, secondly, the ground should be upheld.” 
        
       
       
      I would not go so far as saying that the Crown case here was not strong, although it was certainly far from overwhelming. As has been pointed out, counsel for the defence, at all events, did object to certain extremely prejudicial parts of the evidence which, in my opinion, should have been excluded.  
       
      
    62    The grounds of appeal included the following - 
     
      
       
        
        “1. His Honour erred in admitting evidence of incidents of sexual assault that was not the subject of a count on the indictment. 
         
         
        2. His Honour erred in not giving adequate directions about the use the jury could make of this evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        3. His Honour erred in admitting exhibits R and S. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The trial miscarried by reason of the failure of trial counsel to object to inadmissible and prejudicial evidence and/or by his failure to seek a discharge of the jury when such evidence was given.” 
        
       
      
    63    For the reasons I have given, I consider that these grounds should be upheld and, in so far as it is necessary to grant leave to do so, I propose that leave be granted. The consequence is that the convictions should be quashed and a new trial of all counts be ordered. In the circumstances, it is unnecessary to consider the other grounds of appeal.

     JUDGMENT (Re the word ‘solicit’. See p60 of transcript) 
    The issue was whether ‘solicit’ in the context of the Jury Act has a special or confined meaning which requires a direction of law or a common meaning which should be left to the jury.HELD:1. The expression ‘solicit’ according to the standard definitions includes a wide range of synonyms. In the light of that circumstance and of the further circumstance that the defence contended that it should be understood in a limited sense involving a degree of pressure or persuasion, it was proper to determine, as a matter of law, whether it had a special or particular meaning in the context of the Jury Act. R v H (1993) NZLR 129;  Brutus v Cozens (1973) AC 854 distinguished.. 1. The language of the section is clear and unambiguous. The word ‘solicit’ means to ask or make a request for information, or to attempt to obtain something. It does not require harassment, pressure or importuning.Sweeney v Astle (1923) NZLR 1198; Azzopardi NSWCCA 1 October 1998; Murat Ay NSWCCA 30 October 1998 applied. Forgione  (1969) SASR 248; Herring NSWCCA 24 November 1998;  Rinaldi (1993) 68 ACrimR 284 considered

     JUDGMENT (Re the word 'solicit'. See p60 of transcript.) 
     3   HIS HONOUR: At the close of the Crown case Mr Terracini SC, for the accused, has raised a question concerning the manner in which the case is to be left to the jury in relation to the soliciting element of the charge that has been preferred under s68A of the Jury Act. The submission advanced has not been pursued in the context of a no case submission, but its resolution is said to affect the way in which the defence case might proceed. 
    4   Although it is somewhat irregular for such a matter to be raised absent a no case submission, prior to the close of the evidence, it is convenient for it to be dealt with now since it will need to be resolved before the matter is left to the jury. 
    5   The short point at issue is whether the meaning to be given to the expression ""solicit"" in S68A is a question of fact for the jury, or whether it involves a question of statutory construction, and hence a matter of law as to which a direction needs to be given. The Section provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “(1) A person shall not solicit information from, or harass, a juror or former juror for the purpose of obtaining information on the deliberations of a jury. 
         
        
        Maximum penalty on indictment: imprisonment for 7 years. 
        
        
         
         (2) The deliberations of a jury include statements made, opinions expressed, arguments advanced or votes cast by members of the jury in the course of their deliberations. 
         
        
        
         
         (3) Subsection (1) does not prohibit a person from soliciting information from a juror or former juror in accordance with an authority granted by the Attorney-General for the conduct of a research project into matters relating to juries or jury service.” 
         
        
       
      
    6   The submission advanced on the part of the defence relies upon the observations of Lord Reid in Brutus v Cozens (1973) AC 854 at 861 as follows: 
     
      
       
       ""The meaning of an ordinary word of the English language is not a question of law. The proper construction of a statute is a question of law. If the context shows that a word is used in an unusual sense the court will determine in other words what that unusual sense is. But here there is in my opinion no question of the word ""insulting"" being used in any unusual sense. It appears to me, for reasons which I shall give later, to be intended to have its ordinary meaning. It is for the tribunal which decides the case to consider not as law but as fact, whether in the whole circumstances the words of the statute do or do not as a matter of ordinary usage of the English language cover or apply to facts which have been proved."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    7   It was submitted that if the word “solicit” is used in the present section to have its common meaning, then that meaning is a question of fact for the jury. So that it would be inappropriate for me, as the trial judge, to attempt to give any definition to it by way of a direction of law. However, if it has a special or an unusual meaning, then its construction becomes a matter of law and a direction is needed. 
    8   The context in which this submission was advanced needs to be understood. The Crown contends that the expression ""solicit"" information from a juror or former juror relevantly for this case involves, amongst its other meaning, ""ask for"" or ""request"" information from such a person. It relies, in particular, upon what was said by Sully J in the context of the offence to solicit to murder (s26 of the Crimes Act (NSW) in Azzopardi NSW CCA 1 October 1998). His Honour, with whom Spigelman CJ and Hidden J agreed, cited with approval, at page 13, what had fallen from Stout CJ in Sweeney v Astle (1923) NZLR 1198 at 1002: 
     
      
       
       "" 
       The word 'solicit' is a common English word, and it means, in a simplified form, 'to ask'. In various English dictionaries this simple meaning is given, but other simple words are also used to explain other meanings it possesses, such as 'to call for', 'to make a request', 'to petition', 'to entreat', 'to persuade', 'to prefer a request'."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    9    Azzopardi was itself cited with approval by Smart J, with whom Ireland and Dunford JJ agreed, in R v Murat Ay NSWCCA, 30 October 1998 at page 19, where his Honour expressly noted that the expression ""to solicit"" in this context meant, amongst other things, ""to ask"". 
    10   Mr Terracini contends that although the expression ""solicit"" may include, amongst its common or dictionary meanings, ""ask for"" or ""request"", it also embraces those forms of conduct that involve more than a mere asking or request of a juror for information, but rather calls for a degree of persuasion or influence to be associated with that request. So it was that he submitted that the word should be understood by the jury within the context of s68A as being synonymous with concepts such as earnestly ask, entreat, implore, ask in an aggressive fashion, pester, lobby, vigorously urge, importune, beseech, plead and so on, that is, something a good deal stronger or more forceful or persuasive than a mere ""asking"" or ""request"" for information. 
    11   Herein lies a paradox since, so it seems to me, Mr Terracini wishes to assign to the expression ""solicit"", where used in the section, a meaning that would exclude some of the meanings attributed to it in common parlance or in standard dictionaries. For example, the meanings which appear in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary and in the Macquarie Dictionary, which include the meanings which the Crown advances.  
    12   This submission is pursued in the context of the Jury Act and by reference to a legislative intent said to be disclosed in the second reading speeches when the legislation was introduced in the House. 
    13   Specifically it was submitted that respect needs to be paid to the freedom of speech of jurors, and to a presumed intention that the legislature would not have wished to penalise simple or routine enquiries of jurors, or former jurors, made by friends or relatives as to what had transpired in the course of their deliberations. To quote the relevant submission, it was put that it is inconceivable that the intention of the legislature was to catch every single person who directed an innocuous request or enquiry to a friend or relative who had been on a jury as to what had happened in relation to their deliberations. Rather, it was put that the perceived intention was to stop genuine harassment and intrusion of jurors, for the purpose of obtaining information in relation to their deliberations. 
    14   Further, it was submitted that the decision in Azzopardi, and in similar cases, was to be understood in its particular context of a request by an accused to another to commit an act that would be unlawful. In the present case, however, a request of a former juror to speak about the deliberative process of that juror, or of the jury upon which he or she served, would not be a request to that person to do something that, on his or her part, would be unlawful, since once a trial is at an end, a juror is entitled to speak about the matter if he or she chooses; that is, so long as the juror initiates the conversation. 
    15   As I understand these submissions, if I was to accept that the word ""solicit"" has this more confined or special meaning, then I should direct the jury accordingly. However, if I was of a view that it had, in its common use or parlance, those meanings advanced by the Crown as well as the additional meanings advanced by the accused, then I should not venture into that aspect at all, leaving it to the jury to work out what was meant. 
    16   The issue thus raised seems to me to turn upon whether, in the context of the Jury Act, the relevant expression has the special or more confined meaning upon which the defence relies and excludes some of the meanings that, according to dictionary definitions and ordinary parlance, fall within the umbrella of its common meaning. That seems to me to involve a question of law. If, in his address, Mr Terracini invites the jury to place a special or limited meaning upon the term ""solicit"", dependent upon it being associated with a degree of pressure or entreaty or the like, then unless that point is made good as a matter of law, I consider that I would have to give a direction that in the present context it is not to be so limited or read down.  
    17   When the point at issue is analysed in this way, I do not consider that there is anything in the line of authority, based upon the observations of Lord Reid in Cozens v Brutus and applied in the several decisions cited by Mr Terracini, namely R v Feely (1973) 1 QB 530, R v Glenister (1982) NSWLR 597, Czarniak v R (1985) 118 FLR 36, Peninsular Care Pty Ltd v Bishop (1991) 108 A Crim R 459 or R v H (1993) 1 NZLR 129, which leads to any other conclusion.  
    18   By taking the course which I have identified, I would strictly not be attempting to give a definition of the meaning of an ordinary word in the English language, rather, consistent with authority, I would be making it clear, that as a matter of construction, the law, assuming it to be such, does not call for any gloss upon or attribution of a special meaning to the word ""solicit"" that it does not bear in common parlance. 
    19   In understanding the decisions cited by Mr Terracini, it is necessary to respect the distinction between determining the meaning of a word used in a statute, and determining whether the words used in that statute, do or do not, as a matter of ordinary usage of the English language, apply to the facts which have been proved. The former can involve a question of law when the issue is whether a particular meaning, wider or narrower than its natural meaning, should be attracted to a word or expression employed in a statute and also when the issue is whether one of several possible meanings is or is not embraced by it. The distinction between questions of fact and of law in this context were succinctly explained by Mason J in Hope v Bathurst City Council (1980) 144 CLR 1 at p7 and by Jordan CJ in Australian Gaslight Company v Valuer General (1940) 57 WN 53. 
    20   Moreover, it is not to be overlooked that the observations of Lord Reid in Cozens v Brutus were directed towards ordinary words of the English language or, as Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest put it (at 864), words which are in general use and which present “no difficulty in explanation or understanding.” 
    21   In R v H Hardie Boys J noted at 13, in the context of the expression in a statute, ""living with him as a member of his family"": 
     
      
       
       ""These are ordinary English words, used in their popular sense and not with any legal or technical connotation. Whether as a matter of ordinary usage they applied to the proved facts was a question for the jury:  
        Cozens v Brutus  
       and it was for the judge on the s347 application to consider whether a reasonable jury, properly directed, could conclude they did apply. Nonetheless, as Lord Denning, MR pointed out in 
        Dyson Holdings Limited v Fox 
        (1976) QB 503, it is important that tribunals of fact should apply the words of a statute in the same way. Thus the Court, in appropriate cases, is entitled to give a definitive ruling. And where the words are general rather than specific, or are susceptible of more than one significant shade of meaning, the Judge in his summing-up will need to direct the jury as to the way in which they should be understood in their particular statutory context."" 
       
      
    22   Reference might also be made to the passage in Cross on Evidence, sixth edition, at 276 as follows: 
     
      
       
       ""The proper construction of a statute may require a judge to do more than decide whether words are used in an unusual sense and, if so, what the sense is. The judge may have to choose between a variety of possible meanings, including ordinary meanings of which there are sometimes more than one, and this will result in a direction on the law."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    23   The expression ""solicit"" is not one that is likely to fall from the lips of the average juror in common speech very often or if at all, and as the standard dictionary definitions show, it can embrace a range of synonyms or concepts varying from a simple request to a vigorous urging. In those circumstances it is, in my view, appropriate to determine, as a question of law, whether it has a special meaning in the present context which would exclude some of those meanings, ie whether it bears the meaning advanced by the Crown or is subject to the gloss suggested by the defence. 
    24   In addition to the cases previously mentioned, in support of the word ""solicit"" having, amongst its other meanings, that of asking or requesting or attempting to try to obtain something, is the decision in R v Forgione (1969) SASR 248 where the Full Court stated at 251: 
     
      
       
       "" 
       We do not agree with Mr Moran that the word 'solicit' in this section is restricted to the meaning of 'to importune, to entreat or implore'. Importuning, entreating or imploring may of course be 'soliciting', but so may something less dramatic and less vehement. In our view, a request or a proposal to A that he should murder B, would be a soliciting within the meaning of the section,  
       if seriously made 
       ."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    25    Forgione was itself applied in R v Williams (1978) SASR 423 and in R v Azzopardi where Sully J held that in the circumstances of that case it would have been sufficient, that is, appropriate for the judge to have told the jury that to solicit somebody to commit a murder meant, relevantly for that case, 'to ask' or 'to request' the other person to do that thing. 
    26   Further support for the absence of the gloss for which the defence contends can be seen in the dicta of this court in R v Rinaldi (1993) 68 A Crim R 284 at 291 where the Court, constituted by Curruthers, Sully and Abadee JJ said: 
     
      
       
       ""The point should be made, as forcefully as possible, that any member of the legal profession who questions a juror about matters which have occurred within the jury room runs the risk of offending against s68A of the Jury Act, as well as the possibility of breaching proper professional standards. 
        
         
        
        The point should also be made, no less forcefully, about persons, apart from members of the legal profession who have been involved in any particular trial. An attempt by anybody, be the person lawyer, police officer, court official, journalist or any other member of the public, to breach the privacy and confidentiality of jury deliberations runs the risk, to say the least, of offending against s68A of the Jury Act."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    27    To similar effect are observations in R v Herring NSWCCA 24 November 1998 where the Court, comprised by McInerney, Studdert and Simpson JJ said at page 108: 
     
      
       
       ""It is appropriate again to remind members of the legal profession who have been involved in a criminal trial of the undesirability of engaging in discussions with individuals who have served as members of the jury. Such an observation was made in 
        Rinaldi 
        and attention was there drawn to the provisions of s68A of the Jury Act 1977. Those provisions then prohibited any person soliciting information from jurors for the purpose of obtaining information on the deliberations of the jury for the purposes of publication. By recent amendment (Jury Amendment Act 1997 No. 15) which commenced 1 July 1998 the words ""for inclusion in any material to be published or any matter to be broadcast"" have been deleted. It is an offence to solicit information from jurors for the purpose of obtaining information about the deliberations. Practitioners who engage in discussions with former jurors expose themselves to the risk of contravening the section. Although in this regard it is appropriate to take into account the description of events given by Ms Llardo that the gathering in the hotel took place the day after the verdict was delivered, it remains unwise for the legal representatives of the parties to permit themselves to be in a position where there is a real possibility that they will encounter members of the jury. Where they do so unintentionally or unexpectedly, they should refrain from being drawn into discussion about the trial."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    28   I am not persuaded there is any reason to give the word ""solicit"" a different meaning, in the present context, from that adopted in these decisions, either for the reasons identified by Mr Terracini or otherwise. 
    29   The objective behind the present legislation, I am satisfied, was the perceived need to protect jury confidentiality and anonymity; to encourage the finality of jury verdicts; to foster confidence in jurors, both serving and potential, that their privacy will be respected, and that they will not be pursued or asked to justify their decisions; to protect their right to freedom of speech, in particular their ability to speak candidly in the jury room; to maintain public confidence in the jury system, and to avoid the risk of exposure of their reasoning to public scrutiny or stricture particularly in high profile cases. 
    30   The public interest in maintaining jury secrecy and in providing a significant measure of protection to jurors from intrusion into their affairs by outsiders has been extensively and authoritatively discussed in decisions such as Ellis v Deheer (1922) 2 Kings Bench 113, especially per Lord Justice Atkin at 121; the Prothonotary v Jackson (1976) 2 NSWLR 457; Minarowska and Kozial NSW CCA 23 October 1995. It is also discussed in the report of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission “Criminal Process Report The Jury in a Criminal Trial"" LRC 48 March 1986, chapter 11. 
    31   The report of the Law Reform Commission and the Second Reading speeches identify this objective with clarity. Moreover, the presence of the word ""harass"" in s 68A, disjunctively alongside the word ""solicit"", tends to indicate that the latter expression was intended to involve something not attended to by the kind of pressure that would amount to harassment. 
    32   Further, the presence of that word tends to show that it was the alternative which the Attorney-General had in mind when in the course of the Second Reading speech reference was made to the fact that the Bill would prohibit ""the harassment of jurors and former jurors for information"". 
    33   I am further encouraged to the conclusion that the expression “solicit” does not involve any measure of pressure or importuning by S 68A(3), which makes soliciting permissible where carried out for a jury research project. Those authorised to conduct such a form of research are unlikely to have resorted to pressure or persuasion to obtain information, yet the existence of the exception contemplates that their inquiries of a jury member would otherwise have amounted to a “soliciting”.  
    34   I am not satisfied that the case is one where it is appropriate, consistently with current rules of statutory construction to use either the Law Reform report or the Second Reading speech to construe the word ""solicit"" in the way in which Mr Terracini contends. Nor do I see anything in section 33 of the Interpretation Act 1985, or in the rules concerning the interpretation of legislation which may affect the liberty of a subject that would call for such a result, as noted for example in Orcher (1999) 48 NSWLR 273. Additionally, I see nothing in the current rules of statutory interpretation conveniently collected by Spigelman CJ in Regina v Young (1999) 46 NSWLR 681 which would warrant such a result. 
    35   I am similarly not persuaded that there is anything absurd or extraordinary in the legislation if it is not limited in the fashion suggested. True it may be that unwitting breaches of the law may occur if requests are made of former jurors for information concerning their deliberations. That, however, is not a reason for a gloss to be given to the section having regard to the objective which I perceive to have been behind the section, namely, the reinforcement of the sanctity of the jury process. 
    36   In my view, the language used in the section is clear and unambiguous. Moreover, a polite or private inquiry of a juror as to what occurred in the jury room may well not stop there if answered. It is in the nature of human discourse and affairs that the content of such an exchange will be disseminated on a wider basis, and eventually end up in the public arena, thereby attracting the vice to which the subject section is directed. 
    37   The trial should proceed upon the basis I have outlined.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JTuesday, 29 August 200070011/00 - REGINA v Daniel Raymond CAVEJUDGMENT1   HIS HONOUR: The accused, Daniel Raymond Cave, has been arraigned on the charge that on 22 October 1999 at Glen Elgin he murdered Douglas Cave. He has pleaded not guilty on the ground of mental illness. On 21 August 1999, a day before that fixed for the commencement of his trial, after receiving advice from his counsel, Mr Parker, the accused elected for trial by judge alone. The Crown has consented to that manner of trial. I am satisfied that when he made his election the accused possessed the appropriate mental capacity and received appropriate advice. 
     
      
    2   The accused was born on 13 September 1963 in Glen Innes, and grew up there. He left school at fifteen to take up a job as a roof tiler. He completed his apprenticeship in that trade and continued to follow it for a few years. He also did contract fencing, broke in horses and did other farm work. 
     
      
    3   The offender’s father was of English and Irish extraction and his mother was of Aboriginal descent. His mother died of coronary artery disease in about 1996, and it was at about that time that the accused suffered his first episode of psychotic illness. He began suffering from auditory hallucinations and was admitted to Banksia House, a psychiatric hospital at Tamworth. 
     
      
    4   The voices that he heard spoke to him and to each other. They were dead spirits and were saying that his father was killing his Aboriginal ancestors. The same or other voices told him that he was God’s son and was going to be special one day and take over the world. 
     
      
    5   He had arguments with his father about what the voices were telling him, but did not become violent. 
     
      
    6   He remained in Banksia House for about two months and was treated with drugs. 
     
      
    7   After his release he was followed up for twelve months and was faring well. He was not hearing the voices. He stopped taking his medication. 
     
      
    8   In 1997 the symptoms repeated themselves and he was admitted to hospital again, this time for three weeks. Again he was discharged, feeling well, and was followed up for six months. He stopped seeing the psychiatrist then, because he was feeling well, and stopped taking the drugs prescribed for him. 
     
      
    9   In about June 1999 he took some amphetamines and about one week before the events giving rise to the charge he smoked cannabis. 
     
      
    10   The voices spoke to him again and on Friday 22 October 1999 he was so concerned about what they were telling him that he tried to get his father to admit that he had killed the accused’s aboriginal ancestors. He dragged him out of the house where they lived and began assaulting him, trying to make him admit what he had done. He dragged him to the front of the house, bound his legs with rope and tied him to the back of his own car. He drove the car off, dragging him for a short distance. He got out and looked at him. His father was still breathing. He drove a further five hundred metres to a bridge and there stopped. His father was still alive. He untied the rope from the car and fastened it to the guardrail, then threw his father over the bridge and left him hanging there. He went home and had a cup of coffee and a cigarette. He returned to the bridge and it seemed to him that his father was dead, so he released the rope and allowed his father’s body to fall to the creek bed below. He climbed down, dragged the body under the bridge and covered it with rocks. 
     
      
    11   He drove some forty-five kilometres to Glen Innes and told relatives that he had just killed his father. The relatives informed the police, who went to look for the accused. When they stopped him he gave himself up. They asked him where his father was and he told them everything that had happened. He took them and showed them where he had buried his father’s body. 
     
      
    12   The accused has been seen by Julie Hendy, neuro-psychologist and by Dr Bruce Westmore, psychiatrist. He told Ms Hendy that God and the spirits had been talking to him and telling him that his father had killed his ancestors. He described the sequence of events that led to the death of his father. He now dreams about his father. He felt very sorry about what had happened. By the time the accused saw Ms Hendy, of course, he had been arrested and appropriate drugs were being administered to him. Ms Hendy found that he was of low average intellectual ability and that his behaviour was socially appropriate. Ms Hendy formed the view that he was answering questions to the best of his abilities. She thought that there were no features of any organic brain impairment. He was lucid and was not exhibiting features of his schizophrenia. 
     
      
    13   The accused told Dr Westmore that he was feeling sad and sorry about what had happened. He gave Dr Westmore a detailed account of the attack which I have summarised above. He told him that he had stopped drinking six years ago after being diagnosed with hepatitis C. He told him about the amphetamines and the cannabis that I have mentioned. Dr Westmore observed that the accused’s mood state was subdued but thought that he was not suffering from a major depressive illness. He was no longer suffering auditory hallucinations, they having stopped about five months earlier. He no longer had any delusional beliefs about his father. They, too, had resolved several months earlier. He was a generally alert and attentive historian. 
     
      
    14   Dr Westmore reviewed the documents recording the accused’s two previous admissions to Banksia House and his scheduling under the Mental Health Act on those occasions. He thought that the accused had responded well to anti-psychotic medication over the last six months. He noted the accused’s history of chronic schizophrenia complicated with non-compliance with medication and heavy cannabis use. He felt that the accused had been unwell for some time before he killed his father. 
     
      
    15   Dr Westmore’s opinion is that the accused was suffering schizophrenia when he killed his father and that the episode may have been precipitated by his use of cannabis and amphetamines. He considered that the disease would have totally deprived the accused of the capacity to know that he ought not to do the act causing death and that the act was wrong. Accordingly, Dr Westmore is of the view that the defence of mental illness is available to the accused. 
     
      
    16   I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did the act which caused the death of Mr Cave and that when he did so he intended to kill him. 
     
      
    17   I am satisfied about the existence of all the facts upon which Dr Westmore has expressed his opinion. I accept Dr Westmore’s opinion and I think that the accused has established the defence of mental illness. I am satisfied that when he killed his father he did not know that he ought not to do so and that it was wrong. Accordingly, I find that the accused is not guilty on the ground of mental illness. I order that he be detained in strict custody in Long Bay hospital and such other place as the Mental Health Review Tribunal shall determine until released by due process of law.

     TUESDAY 29 AUGUST 2000 
     
     REGINA v. KENNETH ALFRED SMITH 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   MASON, P: I ask Greg James, J. to deliver the first judgment. 
    2   GREG JAMES, J: The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals to this court against the asserted inadequacy of a sentence imposed upon the respondent in the District Court of New South Wales on one charge of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent under s.61J of the Crimes Act 1900, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. 
    3   The notice of appeal to this court was signed by and purported to be on behalf of the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions. The appeal is however brought by him under delegation and we were provided with evidence of his authorisation from the Director, thus there is compliance with the requirement of s.5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
    4   On an appeal under s.5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the principles are well understood (see Everett v. The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295 and Regina v. Allpass (1994) 72 A. Crim. R. 561). It is only necessary that I refer to certain aspects of them. 
    5   In its consideration of the appeal, the court will not only have regard to the question of whether there has been an error in principle calling for the court's intervention but also whether the court should stay its hand in the exercise of discretion (see The Queen v. Hayes (1987) 29 A. Crim. R. 452). In the event that the court is minded to intervene, it will have regard to the double jeopardy in which the respondent has been placed, in that the respondent is at risk of having the primary sentence overturned and being re-sentenced (see The Queen v. Warfield (1994) 34 NSWLR 2000). In addition, should the appeal be upheld, a lesser sentence will usually be imposed than that which could have been imposed below. Indeed, some of the authorities suggest that the appropriate sentence to be substituted would be the lowest sentence that might have been available at first instance (see The Queen v. Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2). 
    6   In the present matter, the Crown asserts two errors on the part of the learned sentencing judge. The first, that in all the circumstances the sentence was manifestly inadequate, the second, that the sentencing judge erroneously backdated the sentence to the date of the respondent's arrest on 29 April 1999. That latter submission is made on the basis that the respondent was that day also arrested for other offences and sentences had been passed on him by a magistrate in respect of those unrelated offences to commence that day so that the respondent was not in custody from that day solely for the offence in question. 
    7   In respect of the aggravated sexual assault charge, the learned trial judge passed a head sentence of three years and six months with a non-parole period of 20 months, to commence on 29 April 1999, the other sentences to which I have referred passed by the learned magistrate were entirely concurrent. It is argued that the sentence should not have backdated to that date since that is to deprive the magistrate's sentences of any real significance, although it is conceded that the matter was a matter for the discretion of the learned trial judge.  
    8   Mr. Game of Senior Counsel on behalf of the respondent has conceded that there is a dearth of adequate reasoning expressed in the trial judge's remarks on sentence to show the basis upon which the trial judge backdated the sentence and in that sense there at least exists the sort of procedural error identified by the High Court in The Queen v. Fleming (1998) 158 ALR 379 but it is submitted by Mr. Game and conceded also by the learned Crown Prosecutor that there was a basis for a discretion to be exercised by the trial judge to so backdate on sentencing. 
    9   In those circumstances, for my part I would not intervene for the asserted error in the result on that basis. However, when one comes to examine the asserted inadequacy of the sentence passed by the learned trial judge for the offence of sexual assault, the circumstances seem to me different. 
    10   The learned trial judge found, in accordance with a statement of facts tendered to him by consent, that at a time when the complainant was some 11 years old, she went to stay at Christmas in a family home at which her cousin, the offender, was also present. When she was asleep in her bedroom, the offender came into the bedroom, shut the door, removed his track pants and her pyjama top and bottom, lay on top of her and had penile vaginal intercourse with her against her will. In consequence of that intercourse, she became pregnant and gave birth to a child. It was quite clear in all the circumstances that that child was the child of the offender. 
    11   His Honour quite properly adverted to the Crown's contention that the legislature had recognised the seriousness of sexual molestation of children by adults by providing for the increased penalties for such offences when the victims are under 16 years of age. His Honour referred to the necessity to impose a heavy penalty. He referred to the aggravating circumstance of the offender taking advantage of the family context in the home of the victim's grandparent. His Honour did not find that breach of trust, which would have existed had the offender been in a position of actual authority over the victim. However, his Honour did refer to the circumstance that the family relationship had operated to prevent the victim from complaining or notifying what the offender had done. His Honour inferred that the victim would suffer psychological harm. His Honour has expressed findings which are in accordance with the authorities and which plainly show the serious gravity of an offence of this kind. 
    12   His Honour gave to the offender the benefit of the plea of guilty and the benefit of a finding of remorse and contrition. In particular, his Honour made reference to the utilitarian effect of the offender's plea and the saving of the young child from the trauma and embarrassment of court proceedings.  
    13   In Hartikainen v. The Queen (CCA unreported 8 June 1993), Gleeson, CJ. said at 3:- 
     
      
       
       ""In my view, the Crown is correct when it says that his Honour failed to pay due regard to the objective seriousness of the facts of the case. It was pointed out by his Honour in his remarks on sentence that the sexual intercourse was not accompanied by additional violence of the kind that is sometimes encountered in cases of rape. However, non-consensual sexual intercourse is itself an extreme form of violence and one the community expects will be taken very seriously by the courts."" 
       
      
    14   In this case, his Honour has adverted to the very matters to which the court had regard in Hartikainen (supra). The question remains however whether the sentence actually imposed reflects his Honour's appreciation in the upshot of his sentencing task of those factors. 
    15   His Honour turned to the facts personal to the prisoner. At the time the offender came forward for sentence he was 27 years of age. He had had a shiftless and itinerant existence working on farms. He had had a significant problem with alcohol and his Honour held that that had been a significant ""issue as to his offending"". He had sought help for this problem. The prisoner has been assessed by psychologists. His drug and alcohol problems had been identified but at that time there was no reference to a matter of which this court was apprised in evidence today for the first time, of his psychological problems to which I will later refer. His family circumstances were dysfunctional. He did however enjoy for some time the assistance of an elderly couple who supported him. He has had a number of relationships but those relationships have been terminated and we are informed today that his latest relationship has also been terminated. His Honour referred to the offender's prior record including offences for matters of break, enter and steal, assault and other entries. His Honour noted however that this sexual assault was the first offence of this kind which a court had to take into consideration. 
    16   In embarking on the intuitive synthesis required of a sentencing judge having had regard to the objective circumstances of the offence, to the policy matters to which a sentencing judge must have regard and the personal circumstances of the offender, his Honour gave weight to the particular vulnerability of children in the family situation, to the particular brutality of sexual assaults on a young child, particularly involving full penile intercourse producing a pregnancy on a young girl of that age. His Honour was of the view that a deterrent sentence was called for, embodying elements of both personal and general deterrents. 
    17   His Honour had regard to s.5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989 in relation to the proportions of the sentence. However, it becomes apparent when one examines the sentence passed by his Honour that he in fact was dealing with the application of that Act's successor, that is the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. His Honour applied the provisions of the former Act and found special circumstances such as to permit the variation of the proportions. His Honour made orders that the prisoner be released to a supervised parole after serving the non-parole period and orders that the prisoner accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. 
    18   On behalf of the prisoner, both on appeal and on the exercise of the court's intervention to intervene, there have been filed three affidavits. The affidavit of the prisoner deposes to circumstances in which he has been detained, in which he has been subjected to and at risk of serious physical violence. One can accept from that material that the effect of the sentence, or at least the custodial portion of it, on the prisoner is more onerous than that on prisoners sentenced for other crimes.  
    19   In addition, there is provided to us a psychiatric report which indicates that the prisoner has been suffering since the age of 18 from auditory hallucinations and some depression.  
    20   In addition to that report, we have been provided with a report from Dr. Parmegiani dated 25 August 2000 which examines the psychiatric condition of the respondent in greater detail. He is diagnosed by the psychiatrist as suffering from schizo-effective disorder. It is apparent that that schizo-effective disorder may have underlain his antisocial and shiftless history. The psychiatric condition may well underlie the alcohol and drug problems the prisoner has experienced. He will need to remain under psychiatric care, according to the psychiatrist. 
    21   The submission is put that the psychiatric illness is relevant both to the subjective circumstances of the offender on sentence and also to the discretion but it is particularly put that although the psychiatric condition does not bear directly on the commission of the offence, it is a matter that should be taken into account as requiring a longer than usual parole period for supervision in the sentence (see The Queen v. Letteri (CCA, unreported 18 March 1992). 
    22   Reference is also made to the more onerous conditions of custody as suggesting that a shorter custodial period than might otherwise be the case would be appropriate.  
    23   In offences such as this, what has been said by this court on numerous occasions concerning the offence being an offence of severe violence, even if not accompanied by circumstances of other brutality and threats must always be borne in mind. In my view, the trial judge has averted to the relevant considerations but he has failed to translate those considerations into the sentence that he imposed. 
    24   There is no particular range or tariff or precisely corresponding comparable for any one case of this kind. Cases such as The Queen v. PVH (CCA, unreported 2 May 1996); The Queen v. Morrow [1999] NSWCCA 64; The Queen v. May [1999] NSWCCA 40 and Hartikainen (supra), to which I have referred illustrate the diversity of matters that may need to be considered and which may produce different penalties. It is necessary, however, on an appeal such as this to evaluate each case on its own facts and then to examine the sentence passed. It is the function and duty of this court on an appeal under s.5D, absent some matter occasioning the exercise of the discretion, if the court is of the view that the sentence is manifestly inadequate, to intervene insofar as is necessary to correct an error of general principle. Such an error exists where the sentence is so far outside the permissible range of the exercise of a proper discretion as to show error of principle (see Griffiths v. The Queen (1997) 137 CLR 293 and Everett (supra). 
    25   In this case I have concluded that the sentence imposed by the learned sentencing judge was manifestly inadequate. As far as the exercise of discretion is concerned, I am of the view that this sentence, having regard to the totality of circumstances, so differs from that which ought to have been imposed that I would not for myself consider that the court should stay its hand in the exercise of discretion. I am of the view however that we should particularly have regard to the materials to which I have referred provided to the court on this appeal concerning the circumstances in which the respondent is presently detained and his psychiatric condition, and conclude that the sentence that should be passed should not only reflect those matters, the double jeopardy reduction effect to which I have referred, but also in accordance with the recent decision of this court in Regina v. Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309 there should be a discount for the plea of guilty in the circumstances of some 20%. 
    26   I have concluded that an appropriate sentence would be a total sentence to date from 29 April 1999 of four years six months with a non-parole period of 27 months to date from that day. That non-parole period would expire on 28 July 2001. Otherwise, I would confirm the orders made by the sentencing judge concerning supervised parole and the directions that should be given in respect of that supervision by the Probation and Parole office. In accordance with s.48 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I would specify 28 July 2001 as the earliest day on which it appears that the respondent will become entitled to release from custody or eligible to be released on parole. Those sentences should be concurrent with the sentences that had been passed upon the respondent for those other crimes to which I have referred as dated to commence from 29 April 1999. 
    27   MASON, P: I agree. 
    28   LEVINE, J: I agree. 
    29   MASON, P: The orders will be as indicated by Greg James, J.

      REGINA v JOHN DAYEIAN 
      
    1    LEVINE J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the asserted severity of the sentence imposed upon him by his Honour Acting Judge Ford at the Campbelltown District Court on 12 November 1999.  
    2    The applicant had pleaded not guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent (s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900) and not guilty to three counts of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation (s 61J).  
    3    He was found guilty by the jury of the charge in the first count. With respect to the other three counts the jury did not find acts of aggravation, but found the applicant guilty of the available alternative under section 61I. 
    4    Thus the applicant stood to be sentenced in relation to four jury findings of guilt in relation to four counts, each carrying the maximum of fourteen years penal servitude as then provided. 
    5    It was in respect of the fourth count in the indictment that the applicant was sentenced to a minimum term of two years penal servitude to commence on 12 November 1999 and to expire on 11 November 2001 and an additional term of two years. With respect to each of the other counts, a fixed term of twelve months to be served concurrently was imposed. 
    6    The jury's verdict clearly reflected the failure of the Crown to satisfy that tribunal beyond reasonable doubt of the attendant circumstances of aggravation in respect of the three counts under section 61J.  
    7    The four acts of sexual intercourse were digital. The first count relating to anal intercourse in that sense, the remaining three counts vaginal. The applicant and the complainant were husband and wife. The acts of sexual intercourse took place over a period of about five months between September 1997 and March 1998. I do not consider it necessary to elucidate further the facts of each incident, save to remark that perhaps in the scheme of things, if I might use that phrase in a non-technical sense, an idiosyncratic predilection on the part of the applicant in relation to sexual conduct was connected with the act the subject of the first count.  
    8    The grounds of appeal are that the sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly excessive, and outside of any appropriate range. 
    9    It has been submitted, in a two-pronged attack as it were, on the sentence that his Honour, without explanation, seized upon the fourth count to impose the four year sentence structured, as I have indicated. In reality, it was submitted, the conduct founding the verdict on that count was no different to that in respect of the second and third, though is different from the first by reason of anatomical considerations. 
    10    The explanation, in my view, for the imposition of the two plus two years sentence is implicit when one reads his Honour's remarks on sentence. It was founded upon his Honour, in my view, quite properly in the circumstances (at the conclusion of the trial over which he had presided), sentencing this applicant for a series of four separate acts committed over a period of five months. The absence of any express indication by his Honour as to why the fourth count was selected, in my view, exposes no error in procedure, principle or in due course substantively on the matters attending sentence. His Honour, in effect, can be seen to have imposed a sentence reflecting a view of the criminality involved in the four offences of which the applicant had been found guilty and had chosen that which was the most recent in time, the last in the series. 
    11    The second attack made upon the sentence rests upon what is asserted to be his Honour not having taken into account material said to have been available to him on the subject of “special circumstances”. It was submitted that in that part of his Honour's remarks on sentence where he refers to special circumstances, he deals with but few of what are said to have been the many components of such circumstances.  
    12    The relevant part of his Honour's remarks on sentence are, true enough, brief and appear on page four, where his Honour says: 
     
      
       
       ""Special circumstances arise because, in my view, the prisoner would require assistance when he is released back into the community to overcome or try to keep in check his tendency to drink too much and resort to other matters of allaying depression"". 
       
      
    13    That part of his Honour's remarks on sentence follows upon his Honour's remarks at page two where he states, 
     
      
       
       ""It has been pointed out to me that the prisoner suffers quite significant defects, not only as a matter of personality, but also in relation to social contacts and intercourse. I do not doubt that the over-indulgence of intoxicating liquor did lead to the commission of these offences. Dr Hooper regards Mr Dayeian as having an alcohol dependence disorder. He also, according to Dr Hooper, had an adjustment disorder reactive depression relating to charges made against him and it is quite possible that he had suicidal tendencies"". 
       
      
    14    Speaking for myself, bearing in mind those remarks at page two, the brief nature of his Honour's comments at page four, on any reasonable view, can be taken to have encapsulated, embraced and included the matters to which he referred on page two. It is nonetheless still contended that his Honour overlooked a catalogue of characteristics on the subject of special circumstances ranging from very poor education, parenting difficulties, addictive personality, difficulty in human relationships, unemployment, and what is said to be linguistic impairment or language impairment. But when one takes a view of what his Honour said and of the material his Honour undoubtedly had before him made up of not only Dr Hooper's report, the psychologist's report and the pre-sentence report, his Honour, with some economy of language, nonetheless can still, in my view, be taken to have turned his mind to each of those matters to which Mr Radojev has referred. 
    15    It is clear to me that his Honour took into account the objective seriousness of these four offences which this Court has described, time and again, as acts of violence, serious acts of violence, and acts of humiliation. His Honour clearly took into account that this applicant had no criminal antecedents. His Honour rejected, and properly so in my view, submissions made by trial counsel that the case fell within “exceptional” circumstances, thus calling for the dispensation of the requirement for a custodial sentence. 
    16    In the context of having rejected the submission as to “exceptional” circumstances, his Honour appears to me, as I have said, to have made a finding as to available special circumstances and conducted the sentencing exercise that reflected the proper measuring of the objective seriousness of those offences of which the applicant had been found guilty and the subjective circumstances attending the applicant. His Honour arrived at a sentence which cannot be impugned on either of the bases advanced for the applicant, and which viewed in all the circumstances could not be said to be manifestly excessive in the sense generally understood.  
    17    It is not a light sentence, but as far as I am concerned, no error having been exposed in the process at which his Honour arrived at it, no basis for intervention by this Court has been established. The relevant authority as to the objective seriousness of the offence is clear: Regina v Hartikainen (unreported CCA, 8 June 1993) being the judgement of the Chief Justice (see p 3). The authorities in relation to the rejection of “exceptional” circumstances also being clear Regina v May [1999] NSWCCA 40 and see also Regina v Crisologo (1997) 99 ACR 178 at 191. 
     
      
     This case has had an appellate history insofar as this is the second bench to which it has come. Also the unusual and, in my view, quite sad and peculiar facts attending the verdicts of guilty warrant the grant of leave. However, as I have said, nothing warrants appellate intervention. I would propose therefore that leave be granted and that the appeal be dismissed. 
      
    18    MASON P: I agree. 
    19    GREG JAMES J: I do also. 
    20    MASON P: The orders of the Court will be as indicated.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JWednesday, 30 August 200070010/00 - REGINA v Leonard Lawrence BATEMANSENTENCE1   HIS HONOUR: The offender, Leonard Lawrence Bateman, was charged with the murder on 4 August 1999 of his wife Doreen Louise Bateman. On 28 August 2000, the day fixed for the commencement of his trial, he pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter and the Crown accepted the plea in full discharge of the indictment. 
     
      
    2   The offender and the deceased, Doreen Louise Bateman, were married for fifty-one years. By all accounts it was a happy marriage and the offender and the deceased used to do everything together. However, they both experienced illness as they grew older. The deceased was three years older than the offender and in 1998, when she was seventy-six years old, she underwent cardiac surgery. Before and after the surgery she was rendered weak and unable to manage very well. The offender himself was suffering from a number of complaints, including inflammatory bowel disease and was experiencing arthritic joint pain. All the work of the household fell onto him and he began to worry whether he could look after the deceased properly and attend to all his responsibilities. 
     
      
    3   Then, in April 1999, their house was badly damaged in a hailstorm. The roof was wrecked and there was a good deal of water damage. The offender took on the responsibility of engaging a tiler to restore the roof. His symptoms continued and he sought medical help for his abdominal complaint. He lost a lot of weight. In July 1999 a community health worker visited him at home and thought that he was depressed, but he was reluctant to seek treatment. His general practitioner prescribed anti-depressant medicine. 
     
      
    4   The offender’s concerns increased and he become convinced, contrary to the fact, that the tradesman who was tiling the roof was not performing his job satisfactorily. The evidence of their son, Wayne Bateman, shows that the offender had become obsessed about the damage to the roof and had convinced himself unreasonably that he himself had ruined the house by choosing an incompetent tiler. Members of the offender’s family knew that he was not well but did not realise how very seriously ill he was. 
     
      
    5   On 3 August 1999 the offender and the deceased retired to bed as usual. Early in the hours of the following morning the offender took a hammer and beat the deceased about the head as she slept. He telephoned the police and told them that he thought that he had killed her. He dressed and waited for them to arrive. He told them that he had just snapped and that it had been working up for a while since the storm had taken off the roof. Later on he was formally interviewed and said that his intention was to put the deceased out of her misery. He said that things had become different following the storm and that he had struck the deceased to stop any pain she might be feeling. 
     
      
    6   After his arrest the offender was admitted to D Ward at Long Bay Prison Hospital and on 6 August was seen by the Senior Psychiatric Registrar, Dr Farago. The clinical notes taken at that time describe disturbed sleep, depression, significant weight loss and hallucinations. The diagnosis was psychotic depression. On the following day Dr Mastroianni diagnosed major depression with psychotic features. 
     
      
    7   On 17 August the offender was seen by Dr Olav Nielssen who thought him clearly severely depressed and reached a diagnosis of psychotic depression. 
     
      
    8   The offender continued under the management of the psychiatric staff of the gaol hospital and when bail was granted on 7 September it was conditional upon his entering a hospital for treatment. 
     
      
    9   Unfortunately, his depression did not respond satisfactorily to anti-depressant and anti-psychotic medication. He continued to exhibit depressive and psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations of his wife’s voice and a belief that insects were attracted to him because his body was giving off the smell of rotting flesh. Accordingly, a course of electro-convulsive therapy was recommended. Since the offender was considered to lack the insight and judgment necessary to decide about that, he was made an involuntary patient under the provisions of the Mental Health Act. Some indication of the seriousness of his illness is gained from the fact that it took eighteen treatments, compared to a normal course of six to eight, before a satisfactory result was achieved. After about fifteen treatments improvement was noticed and the offender’s mood was much improved. He began enjoying food, his affect became more appropriate, he began to be able to sleep and regained his lost energy. He regained insight and judgment. 
     
      
    10   He is now progressing satisfactorily and feels much more at ease and at peace. He appears to be no longer depressed and is not suicidal. He has taken up again some of the pursuits he enjoyed before these events. He plays tennis and has resumed visiting his children and spending time with them. 
     
      
    11   A number of psychiatrists have given evidence, namely Dr Nielssen, Dr Mastroianni, Dr Shome, the consultant psychogeriatrician at the Sutherland Hospital and Dr Jeremy O’Dea, who has not treated the offender but has provided a report on behalf of the Crown. All seem to agree that the offender’s serious depressive episode was precipitated by the problems he encountered after the house was damaged in the hailstorm. The result was that his reasoning, judgment and insight were significantly influenced by his depressed mood. His abnormality of mind substantially impaired his capacity to make a proper judgment and to control himself. 
     
      
    12   At the present time there is in force a treatment plan approved by the Mental Health Review Tribunal under the terms of a Community Treatment Order. Broadly, the plan requires the offender to attend the Sutherland Community Health Centre at regular intervals, to keep in touch with his case manager and, where it is arranged, to see Dr Shome, to take medication prescribed by Dr Shome and to accept other contact with the case manager, including home visits where they are considered necessary. 
     
      
    13   Those who have reported on the offender agree that if he continues to receive this psychiatric oversight and care the risk of his offending again will be negligible. I accept that assessment. 
     
      
    14   The offender has expressed deep remorse for his actions and I accept that he is genuine. He has suffered greatly himself. But for his illness he would not have acted as he did. There is in my opinion no need to pass any sentence which gives any significant weight to deterrence. He himself needs no deterrence, for he will not reoffend. 
     
      
    15   In my opinion the just and proper way to deal with the matter is to make the offender the subject of a bond, a condition of which will ensure that he continues to be seen, assessed and if appropriate treated by those who have the continuing responsibility for his psychiatric care. 
     
      
    16   Leonard Lawrence Bateman, in lieu of imposing a sentence of imprisonment upon you I direct that you enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of five years from today upon the following conditions - 
     
      
       
      1. That you appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during that term; 
       
       
      2. That you be of good behaviour; 
       
       
      3. That you inform the Registrar of the Supreme Court of any change in your residential address during the term of the bond; and 
       
       
      4. That you continue to abide by the conditions of the treatment plan approved by the Mental Health Review Tribunal or any treatment plan which may be substituted therefor.

     REGINA v. LEE STONES 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   FOSTER, AJA. I agree with the judgment of Greg James, J.2   DUNFORD, J: I agree with Greg James, J. 
    3   GREG JAMES, J: The appellant was convicted on two counts after pleas of not guilty following a trial in the Sydney District Court on 19 July 1999. 
    4   Count one was:- 
     
      
       
       ""That he on 29 April 1998 at Turramurra in the State of New South Wales, being then armed with an offensive weapon, to wit, a knife, did rob John Thearle of certain property, namely, a quantity of jewellery and a sum of money."" 
       
      
    5   Count two was:- 
     
      
       
       ""That he on 29 April 1998 at Turramurra in the State of New South Wales, did allow himself to be carried in a conveyance, namely, motor vehicle bearing registration number GKR 603 knowing that the conveyance was taken without the consent of Alexander Johnston, the person in lawful possession of the said conveyance."" 
       
      
    6   The maximum penalty for the armed robbery offence was 20 years penal servitude and for the motor vehicle offence, five years penal servitude. Both sentences are now to be as understood as sentences of imprisonment consequent on the passing of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 1999. 
    7   On 26 August 1999, the appellant was sentenced as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""Count 1 Minimum term of four years and six months penal servitude to commence on 5 January 1999 and to expire on 4 July 2003. 
       
      
      
       
        Additional term of two years and six months to commence on 5 July 2003 and to expire on 4 January 2006. 
       
      
      
       
       Count 2 Fixed term of one year penal servitude to commence on 5 January 1999 and to expire on 4 January 2000."" 
       
      
    8   The appeal is brought on the ground that:- 
     
      
       
       ""There has been a miscarriage of justice in that the verdicts of the jury:- 
       
      
      
       
       (a) are unsafe and unsatisfactory as it was not upon the whole of the evidence, open for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty."" 
       
      
    9   Leave to appeal is also sought on the ground that the sentences imposed are, in all the circumstances, excessive. 
    10   The ground of appeal asserted in respect of conviction invokes s.6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which requires:- 
     
      
       
       ""… the appeal to be allowed if the court is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence … or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice."" 
       
      
    11   Since the decision in Fleming v. The Queen (1998) 158 ALR 379 and that of this court in The Queen v. Giam (1999) 104 A. Crim. R. 416, the formula ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"" which does not reflect the precise bases referred to in the section, is preferably to be avoided and it is appropriate to identify the ground of appeal or basis for miscarriage with some degree of particularity. 
    12   The written and oral submissions of the appellant presented by Mr. Jeffreys with his customary skill and diligence, identify the basis upon which it is contended the appeal should be upheld and assert that ""the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the appellant's guilt"" (Regina v. M (1994) 181 CLR 487; Jones v. The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439). Such a submission contends that the evidence properly considered in the context of a jury's advantage at trial is inadequate or lacks credibility such as to support the verdict. Such a submission contends that an appellate court upon consideration of all the evidence would, properly directing itself, experience a doubt as to the guilt of the appellant in concluding that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted. 
    13   It was the Crown case that a two-door Toyota motor vehicle, registration GKR 603, mustard in colour, was stolen at some time after about 6.00 pm on Saturday 25 April and before 6.00 am the following day. When the vehicle was located by police on 29 April approximately a half an hour after the robbery involved in the first count, it contained items including a knife consistent with having been used in the robbery, and also two newspapers, one dated 26 April on which was found the thumb print of the appellant and one dated 29 April. Subsequently, that vehicle (although mistakenly identified as a Datsun) was noted by a witness, Mr. Herbert, as transporting away from the jewellery shop, at which premises was committed the second of the offences charged, persons Mr. Herbert had seen running past him, he having seen them earlier in the vicinity of the jewellery shop. 
    14   There were in that vehicle, in addition to the objects to which I have referred, documents including an envelope in the name of David Cowan. Mr. Cowan was the subject of a theft when his bag was stolen in the Manly area on 26 April at about 2.00 pm. Subsequently, to police he identified Paul Edgar as the thief. The man, Paul Edgar was shown by photographs provided to us to bear a degree of resemblance to the appellant. Indeed, it was contended that when Mr. Thearle, the victim of the robbery, attended a line-up (which did not include the appellant) he was suspicious about a person to the end of the line of men present which person was apparently the person Paul Edgar. 
    15   Mr. Herbert gave evidence that around midday on a day in April 1998, while at work, he noticed two men. He described one man as about 5' 8"" tall, stocky build, short dark hair, moustache and aged in his early twenties. He was wearing jeans and carrying a grey calico coloured rucksack. The other man he described as aged in his early twenties, short blond hair, and unshaven. He wore a distinctive royal blue coloured top with white marks on the sleeves, jeans and wraparound sunglasses. 
    16   Several minutes after first observing the two men, Mr. Herbert saw the man wearing the distinctive royal blue coloured top in a jewellers located on the upper level of the building. A few minutes later in a different part of the complex, Mr. Herbert observed the other man running with his rucksack in front of him. Mr. Herbert went to a nearby bakers and on his return he again saw the man in the distinctive royal blue coloured top. This man made a comment to Mr. Herbert regarding the time and Mr. Herbert observed his face for ""a matter of moments"" from a distance of less than a metre. He observed the man get into the mustard coloured Datsun motor vehicle. The man he had previously seen carrying the rucksack was already seated in the driver's seat of the motor vehicle. Mr. Herbert observed the facial profile of the man in the passenger seat before he saw the car drive off along Gilroy Lane towards Eastern Road. Mr. Herbert noted the vehicle registration number. 
    17   On 18 August 1998, Mr. Herbert attended Hornsby Police Station where he viewed a video of photographs. He identified the person pictured in photograph six as the taller man wearing the distinctive royal blue coloured top who he saw in the passenger side of the vehicle. The identification video and a video of Mr. Herbert watching the video were played to the jury. 
    18   John Anthony Thearle gave evidence that he owned Turramurra Jewellers situated at 2/1296 Pacific Highway, Turramurra. On 29 April 1998 at about 1.00 pm, a man (""the first man"") came in and enquired about gold chains. Mr. Thearle spoke with the first man from a distance of 60 centimetres across the showcase. The first man was wearing navy blue tracksuit trousers, a red t-shirt with the Nike insignia at the top. 
    19   The first man left the shop and was next seen by Mr. Thearle about five minutes later to walk past the rear of a shop with another man, ""the second man"". Mr. Thearle saw both men look into the front window of the jewellers for a period of three to five minutes. Mr. Thearle said that for a period of a minute or two, he observed the face of the first man from a distance of five metres. The two men moved off after and shortly after they both returned and entered the jewellers. The first man produced a knife tucked into his trouser waist and pointed it towards him. The first man grabbed the witness and said, ""where is the cash?"". When the first man was unable to open the cash register, he threatened the witness with the knife. The witness opened the registry and took out $425. Following a further threat, the witness opened the safe and the first man took items from it. After making a further demand for cash, the first man cut the telephone line and the two men left. The witness estimated the men were in the shop about 10 to 15 minutes and that during some of the time he was face to face with the first man. 
    20   Mr. Thearle gave a further description of the first man. He added, inter alia, that the man was ""about six feet tall, short copped hair, a very bony angular face, thin, he had blemishes on his cheeks, he was unshaven, sort of day, two days growth perhaps"". He said his hair was ""dark underneath with sort of unbleached highlights"". He said his complexion was ""pale, slight tan"". He also gave a further description of the second man. 
    21   He drew a sketch of the knife used in the robbery which he gave to police. In his evidence he gave a description of the knife. Mr. Thearle viewed the video of photographs at Hornsby Police Station on 15 August 1998. He identified photograph number six as the first man. At the line up at Hornsby Police Station on 26 June 1998 to which I have referred he did not make a positive identification. 
    22   In cross-examination, Mr. Thearle accepted that in his evidence given at the earlier trial and before a magistrate in committal proceedings, he said that the first man was in the jewellers before the woman customer entered the jewellers. 
    23   Mr. Thearle stated in his examination in chief that he later observed the two men looking into the shop window from outside for a period of three to five minutes. In cross-examination, Mr. Thearle accepted that he did not make reference to this observation in his statement dated 29 April 1998 or when he gave evidence in the previous trial. 
    24   In his examination in chief, Mr. Thearle stated that the first man had short cropped dark hair with ""sort of unbleached highlights"". He described the first man's complexion as ""pale, slight tan"". In cross-examination, Mr. Thearle accepted that in his statement of 29 April 1998 he described the first man's complexion as being of slight Lebanese appearance. He also accepted that when he gave evidence in the committal proceedings he described the first man's hair as ""dark coloured short straight hair, dark hair on his arms"". 
    25   In cross-examination, Mr. Thearle agreed that between the time of the robbery and attending a line up at the police station, he saw people in the street who he thought may have robbed him and this made him feel ""jumpy"". He accepted that in the previous trial he gave evidence that he was ""being jumpy, paranoid"". 
    26   Mr. Thearle also agreed in cross-examination that when he attended the line up on 26 June, he thought it was possible that a suspect would be in the line up. He was suspicious of the person at number six in the line up because he had a jaw line that resembled one of the robbers. Mr. Thearle agreed that at a previous trial he was shown a photograph of a person on the line up. On that occasion he could not say whether or not he was the man in the line up about whom he held suspicions. Mr. Thearle asserted that the person in the photograph was not the person he had suspicions about. Mr. Thearle said that his memory had changed to the extent it had become ""sharper"". 
    27   When, at the request of police, Mr. Thearle attended the second identification procedure, the video line up, he expected to see a robber. He viewed the whole video twice and then asked to look further at picture number six, which he viewed the picture for about 30 seconds. He then viewed picture number nine for about 10 to 15 seconds. He then viewed the whole of the video again and looked at picture number six for a further 28 seconds before he positively identified the man pictured in photograph six. 
    28   Mr. Thearle was cross-examined about his state of mind prior to attending the video line up. He agreed that in his cross-examination at the committal proceedings and when he gave evidence in the previous trial he had admitted that he held an expectation that one of the individuals on the video would be a robber. 
    29   Mr. Thearle initially informed the police that one of the robbers was wearing a red coloured t-shirt with a Nike emblem. In his examination in chief he said the offender was wearing the t-shirt when he came into the jewellers prior to the robbery. He was not able to say what he was wearing at the time of the robbery. He said he was able to distinguish the colour red from the colour blue. 
    30   In addition, there was evidence that Mr. Thearle gave a description of offenders to police shortly after the event, describing the first man as ""six feet, slim build, short copped, brown to grey hair, thin face, 30-35 years old, Australian, dark complexion, very thin face and thin nose"". Mr. Thearle positively identified photograph number six as the man who robbed him at a video parade on 15 August 1998 as had Mr. Herbert. 
    31   In addition to the critical evidence of Mr. Herbert and Mr. Thearle, there was other evidence including from Mr. Donald Cowan at the North Turramurra Bowling Club, describing persons who, having come to that Club, telephoned for a taxi and evidence from the taxi driver who took persons from that Club to Wynyard Railway Station. 
    32   The learned trial judge directed the jury, as far as the robbery offence was concerned, that:- 
     
      
       
       ""Unless the identification evidence is reliable, the thumbprint does not take you anywhere."" 
       
      
    33   The appellant gave evidence denying his involvement in the robbery and asserting that he had been given a lift by a man who wanted to purchase heroin to Cabramatta in the vehicle which he did not, at the time he was driven in it, believe to be stolen. 
    34   His account involved an assertion that the stranger had not only driver him to Cabramatta but had given him $150 cash with which to purchase heroin and that he had gone to the premises of a heroin dealer alone with the money, purchased the heroin, but on his return found that the man and vehicle had disappeared. 
    35   It is perhaps sufficient to say that under the test of cross-examination, his account might well have been found by the jury to be wanting. 
    36   As to conviction, the sole ground argued was that upon a consideration of the whole of the evidence the court should be of the view that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt and for that reason the convictions should be quashed. The argument appeared to be put upon the basis that unless there could be satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was one of the persons seen by Mr. Herbert to be entering the vehicle shortly after the robbery, then his association with the vehicle would not be sufficient to support count two in the indictment. 
    37   It was put expressly that, having regard to the inconsistencies, particularly in the evidence of Mr. Thearle, internally, and the inconsistency between that evidence and the evidence of Mr. Herbert, considered in the context where there was no positive identification by others, including, in particular, Mr. Cowan from the bowling club and the taxi driver; where Mr. Edgar bore such a resemblance to the accused and where there had been what it was submitted was some doubt on the line up identification attendant on Mr. Thearle's rejection of those men in the line up as having been the robbers, that the conviction could not stand. Particularly is this submitted in the context of a description of the accused given by Mr. Cowan which made note of the scar on the left cheek of one of the persons he describes and some degree of confusion attendant upon the different coloured tops and the distinctively coloured backpack that it is said the robbers had with them. 
    38   The court was taken in detail to the evidence. In particular, the submission pointed to the timing involved and how little time was available to Mr. Herbert to make any dependable or reliable observation, this was particularly emphasised, since Mr. Thearle's evidence was, in some respects as I have remarked, apparently inconsistent. 
    39   The challenge was essentially to the reliability of the evidence, not to honesty. In each case, the witness had expressed their personal view that their identification of the robber from the video pictures was ""beyond reasonable doubt"" or ""100% accurate"". 
    40   Whilst the appellant's account in evidence was not left to the jury as being so incredible as to amount to a lie showing consciousness of the guilt of the two offences charged, nonetheless, if it were put to one side as failing in itself even to raise a reasonable doubt, one is still left with the various accounts of Mr. Thearle and Mr. Herbert which are mutually supportive. I consider it would be in error to disregard entirely the association with the vehicle which, on the evidence of Mr. Herbert, was tied in so crucially with the robbery. Notwithstanding the submission that Mr. Herbert had in various episodes totalling five seconds, too limited an opportunity to make a reliable observation and that Mr. Thearle's evidence was unreliable because of the inconsistencies asserted, the different descriptions given within half an hour of the event to the police, the display of some doubt by him during the line up, having regard to the matters involving the clothing, an asserted willingness by Mr. Thearle to defend his description and the experience of courts that there have been, on occasions, errors in identification, I am not persuaded that the verdict in this case is attended by any real doubt. Except for one of the descriptions given by Mr. Thearle, all relevant descriptions given of the robber were entirely consistent, albeit, some features might have been omitted by individual witnesses. Mr. Herbert's account was powerful, notwithstanding the short and episodic nature of his observations. 
    41   Mr. Thearle was able to observe the robber for a period of some minutes. The distinction between the various descriptions given by him is only really of substance when distinguishing between Lebanese appearance and a dark complexion, dark coloured hair and brown to grey hair. The various observations and the association with the car are all mutually supportive of reliability of the witness' individual accounts. 
    42   The jury had the fullest opportunity to observe the evidence being given. There is no complaint as to the directions given to the jury and I do not accept that the witness' testimony in each case is impugned necessarily by the confidence attendant upon their identification individually of the same man whose fingerprint just happens to have been found on the newspaper in the stolen car. 
    43   I do not consider that the jury's verdict is attended by any doubt or lack of support in the evidence. 
    44   In my view, the appeal on conviction should be dismissed. 
    45   There was also an application for leave to appeal against sentence. It was contended that the sentence was manifestly excessive, having regard to the applicant having been 26 years of age at the time of the offence, and that it was his first time for sentence in the District Court. It was further contended that it was his first offence of violence if one disregarded his conviction for stealing from the person. 
    46   It was submitted that regard should be had to his drug addiction as at least prescribing a context which suggested a lack of prior planning. In this regard, of course, the stealing of the car and the evidence of Mr. Herbert and Mr. Thearle suggest some degree of planning on the applicant's behalf. Even for a drug addict, the robbery of a jewellery store involves some degree of planning. He apparently, to some extent, prepared for the robbery. 
    47   The challenge is only brought against the sentence for armed robbery. In addition to that sentence and the sentence for the offence of s.154A of the Crimes Act 1900, the prisoner had also appeared for sentence in respect of two further offences of larceny and common assault. It was in that context that her Honour came to impose the sentence of penal servitude for seven years, comprising a minimum term of four and a half years and an additional term of two and a half years, that she did in respect of the armed robbery offence. 
    48   She had regard to the guideline decision in Regina v. Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 and, in particular, to those matters which, in her view and in the Crown's submission, properly took the appropriate sentence for that offence above those sentences to which that guideline related. There was no plea of guilty. A substantial amount was taken. The offence was committed whilst the offender was on a recognizance and the offence was committed in the light of other unlawful conduct for which her Honour was sentencing. 
    49   I see no error in the sentence passed by her Honour and, in any event in my view, that sentence was plainly within the range of appropriate sentences. I would grant leave to appeal on sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
    50   The orders I propose are: appeal against conviction dismissed; leave to appeal against sentence granted; appeal dismissed.

       JUDGMENT 
       
       
       
      
    1    HEYDON JA: 
     
      
      Background 
       
       
      Shortly after midnight on the night of 6-7 May 1988 the appellant was found by police sitting near the corpse of his de facto wife, Janice Maree Goodwin, at their home in Umina. She had been punched, and she had suffered 35 stab wounds, one of which had severed her carotid artery and caused death. He was charged with murder. He was tried on that charge in May 1990 before Lusher AJ and a jury and convicted. At that trial he was not legally represented. An appeal, on which he was legally represented, succeeded on the ground that inadmissible evidence had been received:  
      R v Frawley 
       (1993) 69 A Crim R 209. On 2 August 1994, a second trial, at which he was legally represented, began before Abadee J and a jury. On 30 August 1994 he was convicted. On 6 December 1994 he was sentenced to life imprisonment. He appeals against that conviction and that sentence. 
       
      
    2    The evidence given by the accused in relation to events just before and just after the killing was as follows. In the 48 hours up to 6 pm on 6 May 1988 he drank 38 cans of beer and 6-8 glasses of wine. On 6 May he ingested three types of medication intended to relieve back pain, including Mogadon. He said that some time after 6 pm he decided to sleep in the car in order to relieve his back pain. His next recollection was that the victim said to him: “I have scratched all of your face”. He remembered kneeling beside the victim, who said “Say my prayers” or “Help me say my prayers”. He leant over and said “Hail Mary”, “Our Father” and “Act of Contrition”. The victim followed him in the prayers. He next remembered being on the back verandah holding a rope and trying to tie a knot. He then remembered cutting his right arm with a razor blade but dropping the razor blade. He could not remember telephoning a Roman Catholic priest, Father R J McCann, who alerted the police to the killing. He could not remember the arrival of the police officers at the house, nor leaving it by ambulance, nor being at the hospital to which it took him. He could not remember the questions asked or the answers given in a police record of interview. He could remember being photographed and charged (3/537-550).  
     
      
    3    The police evidence was that they arrived after a call from Father McCann. The police found the victim lying on her back in the hallway. The appellant was sitting nearby at a kitchen table. There were signs of a violent and lengthy struggle both downstairs and upstairs. 
     
      
    4    At the second trial, the arguments of the appellant which received most attention in evidence, addresses and summing up centred on the contention that he was so intoxicated or affected by drugs or both that, assuming that he had inflicted the wounds which caused the victim’s death, he lacked the mental element necessary if murder were to be established. He contended that his acts were not voluntary or willed by reason of intoxication operating on a sound mind, or by reason of intoxication causing insanity. He contended that the Crown had failed to prove that he intended to kill the victim or inflict grievous bodily harm on her. He submitted that if the elements of murder had been made out, he was entitled to a verdict of manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility. He contended that if there was a reasonable doubt about his intention to kill the deceased or inflict grievous bodily harm on her, he was not guilty of manslaughter. But apart from these defences centring on his mental state, the accused also contended that the Crown had failed to prove that he committed the acts causing death. The trial judge gave the jury directions in relation to the burden of proof on the Crown in that respect by reference to the evidence bearing on the question (pages 25/26.8-27.1, 32.4, 32.8, 66.6-68.8, 71.9-72.8, 75.4-75.6, 78.1-91.5 and 120.1-123.5 of the summing up, and question 1 of the document handed to the jury entitled “Issues for the Jury To Consider In Arriving At Its Verdict”).  
     
      
       
      Structure of the Appeal 
      
    5    The appellant’s Notice of Appeal, filed on 2 February 1995, said that the appellant desired to appeal against both conviction and sentence, but stated no grounds. However, none of the grounds of appeal which were later formulated go to the sentence, and no argument was directed to criticism of it. The appeal against sentence must therefore be dismissed.  
     
      
    6    An extraordinarily long period elapsed between the filing of the Notice of Appeal and the hearing of the appeal. This is explained by the inability of the appellant to obtain legal aid until quite late. Even then, the grant did not extend to all the grounds of appeal. Further, the appellant, who was born in 1938, has been in very bad health. He has had bad chronic back pain for many years, only partly alleviated by drugs which affect his capacity for mental work. He has had surgery several times for his spinal condition, for bowel cancer and for heart trouble. This has affected his ability to prepare the appeal, and has caused various fixtures to be vacated. 
     
      
    7    At the hearing of the appeal counsel presented oral argument on two groups of grounds and the appellant presented oral argument on aspects of them and on aspects of some other grounds. The appellant also filed written submissions which fell into three groups. First, a prison friend of his prepared a statement of three grounds of appeal and put detailed written argument, with reference to the authorities on the first ground, concerning relationship evidence. Secondly, the appellant’s solicitor presented a capable written argument on the third ground of appeal, relating to certain DNA evidence not tendered at the trial. Thirdly, the appellant himself prepared the following written submissions: 41 pages (with a further 25 pages of annexures) on the grounds relating to DNA; 33 pages (with a further 7 pages of annexures) on a ground relating to the admissibility of a record of interview; 15 pages (with a further 27 pages of annexures) on a ground relating to the admissibility of Dr Wong’s evidence; a further 13 pages on the grounds relating to DNA; 10 pages (with a further 9 pages of annexures) in reply to the Crown’s submissions on the DNA grounds; 11 pages (with a further 8 pages of annexures) in reply to various of the Crown’s submissions; and one page on the relationship evidence ground. The appellant’s submissions used a different numbering system from that employed below, but no confusion was caused by this.  
     
      
    8    It is convenient to group the grounds of appeal relied on as follows. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: Relationship Evidence 
      
    9    Ground 1 was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. (a) The learned trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of Jeacle (Relationship Evidence); 
        
       
       
        
        Alternately; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) The learned trial judge erred in failing to properly and/or fully exercise his discretion to exclude the evidence of Jeacle; 
        
       
       
        
        Alternately; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) The learned trial judge erred in his directions to the jury in relation to Jeacle’s evidence, in particular, (i) the directions were likely to have been confusing and misleading; (ii) the jury should have been directed on the limited use which they could make of that evidence and specifically, that they could not use it as evidence of ‘motive’ or evidence that may assist them in determining the question of ‘intention’ or for any other reason, other than for what it may have properly been admitted; and (iii) they should disregard and put out of their minds evidence from Jeacle that the appellant had made advances toward her. 
        
       
       
        
        Alternately; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The learned trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that if they were intending to rely upon the evidence as assisting them in regard to motive or intention, then before they could do so, they should specifically be satisfied of the truthfulness of such evidence beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
       
      
    10    On 11 August 1994 Mrs Jeacle began to give her evidence. It was to the following effect. Mrs Jeacle was the next door neighbour of the victim, her husband and their two daughters when the victim’s family lived in Canberra. In 1984 the victim’s husband departed. The appellant began to visit the victim at her home from about April 1986 and moved into the house shortly thereafter. Just before Christmas 1987 Mrs Jeacle noticed that the relationship between the victim and the appellant had become strained. They began to have arguments about once a week in their house which were audible in Mrs Jeacle’s house. She often overheard the appellant calling the victim a “bitch” and sometimes a “slut”. He also said that she was “crazy”. During this period there were occasions when the appellant would come over to Mrs Jeacle’s home in a drunken condition. He would say that he had had a fight with the victim and that he wanted to move out. He always called her a “crazy bitch” and occasionally referred to her as a “slut”. On at least one occasion he said he hated her. A few weeks prior to the move by the appellant and the deceased from Canberra to Umina, Mrs Jeacle received a telephone call from the appellant at her place of work. He said he wanted to talk to her about the victim. Mrs Jeacle eventually agreed to meet him. He told her that he had had enough and was not going to move with the victim “and then he made some advances towards me”. He said that the victim was not being generous towards him with her money and he was tired of always begging for money. The appellant asked Mrs Jeacle if he could rent a room from her but she refused. The deceased and the appellant moved in March or April 1988 (3/426-428).  
     
      
    11    Before that evidence was given on 11 August, on 5 August 1994 the trial judge heard argument about its admissibility (2/192-194). He ruled that it was admissible, giving detailed reasons for judgment.  
     
      
    12    Ground 1(a) complains of the admission of Mrs Jeacle’s evidence as a matter of law. The appellant put five arguments. First, it was said that the trial judge wrongly had regard to what transpired in the appeal after the first trial: Gleeson CJ had said, obiter, that Mrs Jeacle’s evidence was admissible. Secondly, it was submitted that what Mrs Jeacle described was both too brief in time and too remote in time to be relevant, and stress was placed on Barwick CJ’s reference to “the nature of the current relationship” in Wilson v R (1970) 123 CLR 334 at 337. Thirdly, it was said that the evidence “was not admitted on the basis of motive or indeed as evidence which could assist the jury in determining the question of ‘intention’”, and there was no other basis on which it was relevant. Fourthly, the appellant in oral argument contended that Mrs Jeacle’s evidence was unreliable in various ways. Fifthly, the appellant in one of the written submissions composed by him submitted that an answer by Mrs Jeacle to a question about how her daughters got on with the appellant was inadmissible.  
     
      
    13    In relation to the first point, Gleeson CJ referred to Mrs Jeacle’s evidence in order to illustrate a contrast between admissible relationship evidence and the evidence which, the Court of Criminal Appeal went on to hold, had been incorrectly admitted at the first trial. It is true that Gleeson CJ’s words were obiter dicta, and no doubt defence counsel at the second trial was correct in saying that he conceded admissibility before the Court of Criminal Appeal, so that Gleeson CJ’s opinions about admissibility, being propounded without the benefit of argument, did not constitute a decision on the point (2/192.8). However, it was not wrong for the trial judge to adopt Gleeson CJ’s reasoning as his own after the point had been fully argued before him and after defence counsel’s submission about the lack of argument in the first appeal had been noted, as he did on page 5 of his reasons for judgment. Further, the primary support for the trial judge’s conclusion was not Gleeson CJ’s opinion in the first appeal, but the decision of the High Court in Wilson v R (1970) 123 CLR 334 at 335. 
     
      
    14    So far as the second argument based on lack of contemporaneity is concerned, Mrs Jeacle’s experience of the appellant’s relationship with the victim extended over the period April 1986 to March or April 1988. The killing was on 6 May 1988. The trial judge was entitled to treat the gap of at most six weeks as being too small to be significant. He was also entitled to treat the period about which the evidence of past relationship was given - about four months - as sufficiently lengthy to permit its reception.  
     
      
    15    The third point is sound to the extent that motive was not in issue. But it is not sound in suggesting that “intention” was not in issue. The appellant contended at the trial that he did not have any intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. He supported that contention with his evidence - received through his account of the events of 6 May 1988, the contents of his admissions, and otherwise - that the relationship was a loving and affectionate one, and in particular that it was “tremendous” (3/553.9). The Crown was entitled (and in effect obliged, if only because of its foreknowledge, derived from the first trial, that this was a likely defence line) to endeavour to meet that issue in its own case by calling evidence that the relationship had a tense, bitter and hostile side, and that the appellant had shown signs of a desire to end it. Mutual enmity between husband and wife can go to the issue of whether a killing was deliberate or accidental: Wilson v R (1970) 123 CLR 334 at 337 per Barwick CJ and 344 per Menzies J; R v Frawley (1993) 69 A Crim R 208 at 225.2 per Sheller JA . It is true that the trial judge did indicate, at the close of Mrs Jeacle’s evidence in chief on Thursday 11 August 1994, while debating with counsel what direction should be given about Mrs Jeacle’s evidence and whether it should be given not only in the summing up but also before the approaching weekend, that he was proposing to say, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “The statements are not to be treated as any evidence of the fact that the accused did wish, or intended to kill or inflict serious bodily harm or otherwise harm the deceased” (3/429). 
        
       
       
      However, the trial judge said these were only his “preliminary thoughts”, and he asked counsel to consider the matter overnight. The next day he indicated some directions he proposed to give which did not include the above words (3/430.1-.2), and then gave those directions to the jury (3/430.2-.3). In his summing up the trial judge directed the jury that Mrs Jeacle’s evidence touched on whether the relationship was a “sweet and loving”, “happy” or “loving and passionate” one (pages 17 and 120), or a “tremendous” one (page 122). The evidence was relevant to the appellant’s intention, and the trial judge so treated it in the summing up.  
       
      
    16    The fourth matter raised was the unreliability of Mrs Jeacle’s evidence. The jury was well placed to choose between Mrs Jeacle’s version and the appellant’s substantial though not complete contradiction of it. Her evidence was not shown to be so unreliable as to be inadmissible or as to be the source of a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    17    Finally, the answer complained of was supplied to a question in cross-examination - that is, a question put by the appellant’s counsel. The answer may or may not have been correct, but that was a matter for the appellant’s counsel to deal with at the time.  
     
      
    18    In ground 1(b) the appellant complained that the trial judge gave no reasons for not rejecting the evidence on the ground that its prejudicial effect exceeded its probative value. In my opinion it was not obligatory for him to do so. His failure to give reasons does not indicate any overlooking of the argument. He noted the argument (page 3.5 of his 5 August 1994 reasons for judgment). That argument was evidently put as a secondary position, being recorded in one sentence (2/193.8), while the balance of defence counsel’s argument on admissibility is recorded in more than a page (2/192.7-193.8). Defence counsel is not recorded as making any complaint about whatever argument he advanced on discretionary exclusion not being dealt with when judgment was given (2/194). The extreme unlikelihood of the trial judge overlooking defence counsel’s submission is also supported by his acceptance of a similar submission immediately after the ruling on Mrs Jeacle’s evidence (2/194.2-.7 and judgment of 5 August 1994), and also by his rejection of part of Mrs Jeacle’s evidence on grounds which included that ground at the close of her evidence in chief (3/431.9). In any event, it would not have been correct to reject Mrs Jeacle’s evidence on discretionary grounds. Though the appellant submitted there was a possibility of concoction or error, these possibilities were not so strong as to create unfair prejudice. If accepted, the evidence in its principal elements had some probative force in meeting one of the appellant’s lines of defence, and it had no unfairly prejudicial effect: the only prejudice to the appellant flowed from the probative force. 
     
      
    19    Ground 1(c) contains three complaints about the trial judge’s directions on Mrs Jeacle’s evidence. The trial judge on two occasions before the summing up debated the form of the directions on this subject with counsel. During the summing up, the trial judge adopted the practice of inviting counsel at every adjournment to comment on his directions in the absence of the jury and make suggestions for the curing of any perceived problems. Neither counsel made the complaints now made. The appellant’s counsel at the trial had very considerable experience and skill in conducting heavy criminal trials, and a perusal of the transcript reveals very diligent application to the appellant’s interests. His earnest arguments on both the admissibility of and the directions about Mrs Jeacle’s evidence reveal that his failure to complain about the summing up in this respect was not an oversight and point against any injustice having been perceived at the time. Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules requires leave for these grounds to be advanced. I would refuse that leave. In any event, the grounds would fail even if leave were granted. The directions were not confusing or misleading. It was not necessary to tell the jury not to use the evidence as evidence of motive, and the directions adequately guided them on other issues in accordance with Wilson v R (1970) 123 CLR 334. Very brief evidence about the appellant’s advances towards Mrs Jeacle, which was arguably not responsive to the Crown prosecutor’s question, pointed, though not very strongly, against the appellant’s case that his relationship with the victim was “tremendous”; its prejudicial effect was also very weak; but even if this evidence was technically inadmissible, it is a clear case for applying the proviso.  
     
      
    20    As to ground 1(d), the evidence was not tendered to prove motive, and hence the motive cases relied on, R v Murphy (1985) 4 NSWLR 42 and Penney v R (1998) 155 ALR 605 at [26], are not in point. In any event, the jury were directed on the standard of proof (eg pages 21-22, 25/26, 52-53 and 63) in a fashion which could not have left them with the impression that any lower than normal standard applied to Mrs Jeacle. This complaint, too, cannot be agitated without leave pursuant to rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. For the reasons given in relation to ground 1(c), I would refuse leave.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1: Application of Proviso 
      
    21    It is convenient at this point to consider whether, assuming, contrary to what has just been said, any part of ground 1 had been made out, the appeal should nonetheless be dismissed because of the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The proviso permits dismissal of the appeal if this Court “considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred”. The question is whether “an appropriately instructed jury acting reasonably on the evidence before them and applying the correct onus and standard of proof would inevitably have convicted the accused”: Wilde v R (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 372. 
     
      
       
        
        “[In] determining the question, it will be appropriate to have regard to the strengths and weaknesses of the prosecution and defence cases in order to assess the gravity and significance of the error”:  
        Glennon v R 
         (1994) 179 CLR 1 at 8. 
        
       
       
      The question of whether the proviso can be applied has relevance to the other grounds of appeal as well, to the extent that they can be made out.  
       
        
          
        
       
      
    22    On the evidence, there was a strong case that the accused was responsible for the victim’s death. The strength of the case rested on various items of circumstantial evidence and on numerous admissions the appellant made of having killed her. The circumstantial evidence included the fact that the death occurred at the house at Umina in which the appellant and the victim lived, the fact that on his own evidence the appellant was on the premises that night sleeping in the car, the fact that the appellant made a telephone call from the premises soon after death and was found there by police a little later, the fact that a violent struggle had taken place both in the immediate neighbourhood of the victim’s body downstairs and upstairs, the fact that the appellant’s wrist watch, pendant and ring were found on the floor near the deceased, the fact that the appellant’s “Uncle Henry” brand folding knife was found next to the deceased’s head and had been used as the weapon which killed her, the lack of any real evidence that any intruder was present, or had any motive for the killing, the fact that no valuables were missing, and the fact that the accused was wearing a torn shirt covered with blood.  
     
      
    23    The only explanation for the ring, pendant and watch which the appellant offered was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellant’s watch was silver with a metal band that was broken. If the watch had been ripped off his arm the skin would have been cut. The coins on the floor of the middle landing showed that the appellant emptied his pockets of money and could have removed his watch and ring and neck chain and placed them on the table. The appellant says that the killer had the ring, watch and neck chain when he assaulted the deceased and lost them in the assault.” 
        
       
       
      That was not an explanation given by the appellant in evidence: he could not explain how the watch, ring and pendant came to be on the living room floor (3/550.5-.9 and 605.6-606.6). The appellant gave evidence of a practice, on going to bed at night, of placing his coins, jewellery and watch on a table (3/564.2). This practice cannot have been followed that night if the appellant was correct in his evidence that he went to sleep in the car. The submission thus does not explain away the adverse inferences from the circumstantial evidence. Nor was any of the other circumstantial evidence explained in such a way as to raise a reasonable doubt in the appellant’s favour.  
       
      
    24    The admissions were as follows. 
     
      
    25    At about 11.30 pm on 6 May 1988 the appellant telephoned Father McCann, a Roman Catholic parish priest at Campbelltown with whom he was acquainted. According to Father McCann: “He told me that he had just stabbed Jane [sic] in the neck and she was dead” (2/7). Father McCann also testified that the appellant said: “I know I’ve done it but I don’t know why I’ve done it” (2/15.9-16.5 and 16.9). 
     
      
    26    Shortly after 12.26 am on 7 May 1988, when Sergeant Fogg and Constable Schultz entered the couple’s house, the following conversation occurred between Sergeant Fogg and the appellant. Sergeant Fogg said: “Have you got a gun or a knife?” The appellant said: “I’ve got nothing, it’s all over”. Sergeant Fogg then walked to where the appellant was seated, and the appellant said: “I’ve just done something terrible to the most beautiful person in the world”. Sergeant Fogg said: “Mate, what have you done?” The appellant gestured with his arms towards the deceased and said “She’s the most beautiful person in the world and I’ve done this” (2/80.8-81.2). Constable Schultz corroborated this (2/178.9-179.3).  
     
      
    27    A little later Sergeant Lawley, who arrived after Sergeant Fogg and Constable Schultz, heard the appellant say: “No-one else did it, I did it”. Sergeant Lawley said: “Is there anyone else in the house?” The appellant answered: “No” (2/186.1 and 187.1). Constable Schultz corroborated this (2/179.9-180.1).  
     
      
    28    On the way to Gosford District Hospital, in the ambulance, the appellant said in the presence of Mr D W McClenahan, an ambulance paramedic, and Constable Hogan: “I don’t know what I did it for to Jan, she deserves respect” (2/133.4).  
     
      
    29    After admission to Gosford District Hospital, the appellant said to Mr D A Brown, a nurse: “I killed the most beautiful woman in the world. I killed her, I will write it down if you like” (2/117.6).  
     
      
    30    All these admissions were spontaneous, voluntary and volunteered in every sense. There was no challenge to their admissibility and no challenge to the evidence that they were made. Most of them were supported by contemporaneous notes of persons accustomed to taking notes. Some of them were confirmed in the record of interview made later that night.  
     
      
    31    After the appellant had been taken from the hospital to Gosford Police Station, Detective O’Brien told the accused he wished to ask some questions in relation to the death of the victim. The appellant replied: “I have done a terrible thing” (2/238.8).  
     
      
    32    The appellant was then interviewed by Detective O’Brien at 3.40 am and a record of that interview was made by Detective Ashton. Questions 29-31 and the answers to them are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q29. Could you tell me how the blood got on your knife?  
        
       
       
        
        A. There is only one way the blood could have got on the knife. 
        
       
       
        
        Q30. How? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I must have stabbed her. She had this ugly big wound in her throat. It couldn’t have been anyone else. I walked around her a few times, I stepped over her, I touched her. I don’t know what time it happened. I usually walk away from arguments you can go back through my history. 
        
       
       
        
        Q31. Is there anything else you can tell us? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Can I stop now I don’t want to say anything more. Except I know you are going to charge me with murder. I am guilty of a terrible thing, I know that there is no way I can defend this and I don’t want to. Can we finish up now?” 
        
       
       
      
    33    In my opinion no jury acting reasonably could have avoided concluding that the appellant killed the victim, and (unless it accepted some argument based on his mental state, which neither jury did) convicting on the admissions alone. The circumstantial evidence strengthened the conclusion that the appellant was the killer. If the appellant were to have avoided an otherwise inevitable conviction, there would have to have been evidence pointing to the reasonable possibility of innocence consistently with the circumstantial evidence (that is, evidence of an intruder) and consistently with the admissions. The trial judge directed the jury along the following lines about the admissions made before the record of interview (page 82): 
     
      
       
        
        “… you will also have regard, to the extent that you consider it appropriate, to the suggestion that even a person who has had a blackout or memory loss can perhaps confabulate or, as Dr Wong said, confabulation occurs when a person is unable to remember something and fills in the gaps, or as Dr Quinn said, confabulation is when a person appears to remember that which is random or spurious.” 
        
       
       
      The trial judge suggested that the jury bear in mind that Mr McClenahan, an experienced ambulance officer, did not regard the appellant as particularly affected by drink or drugs (page 84). He pointed out that the detail of non-controversial material given in answers, as well as the acknowledgments of earlier admissions, as recorded in the record of interview raised a question for them going to whether it pointed against the appellant being in a state of blackout or amnesia, or as confabulating (pages 87-90). The proposition that the appellant made incorrect admissions of killing immediately afterwards while later professing a complete absence of recollection is not one that a jury would regard as a reasonable possibility without assistance from expert evidence. This Court was taken to none and it appears that none was forthcoming (see Dr Wong at 3/491.9 and 526.2-.9, and Dr Quinn at 4/804-806).  
       
      
    34    The strength of the prosecution case that the appellant killed the victim may be gauged from certain observations of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the first appeal, at a time when the relationship evidence presently objected to was not objected to and at a time when none of the other current grounds of appeal were being advanced. Gleeson CJ said (R v Frawley (1993) 69 A Crim R 208 at 209): 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence against the appellant established beyond any doubt that on 6 May 1988, following a violent argument and a struggle, he stabbed and killed Janice Maree Goodwin, who was his de facto wife.” 
        
       
       
      Sheller JA said at 224: 
       
        
        “the evidence against the appellant established beyond any doubt that on 6 May 1988, following a violent argument and a struggle, he stabbed and killed … his de facto wife.” 
        
       
       
      These remarks related to the identify of the killer. On the other group of defences raised, Gleeson CJ said at 215: 
       
        
        “The Crown case against the appellant was very strong. The issue upon which the defence focussed, i.e. the ingestion of alcohol and drugs on the evening of the killing, was one that was fraught with risk for the defence. There was an obvious danger that a jury might treat the alcohol and drugs as the explanation of the conduct of the appellant, but not an excuse for it. There were inherent difficulties about some aspects of the appellant’s claimed amnesia. For example, when he was interviewed by the police in the early hours of the morning following the killing, he gave rational and coherent answers to all the questions that he was asked, but at his trial he claimed that he could not remember the interview.” 
        
       
       
      On that subject, Gleeson CJ said at 213: 
       
        
        “The record of interview, which was taken at about 3 am, and which was tendered in evidence, shows the appellant giving perfectly rational answers to the questions that he was asked. They were exculpatory, in the sense that he denied any recollection of the actual killing of the deceased, but there is nothing about the contents of the record of interview that would cast any doubt upon the reasoning powers or mental capacity of the appellant at the time he was interviewed.” 
        
       
       
      Gleeson CJ said at 223.9-224.1: 
       
        
        “The evidence that [the appellant] ferociously attacked and killed the deceased is overwhelming and, having regard to the circumstances of her death, the suggestion that he did not at least intend to cause her grievous bodily harm, even allowing for his ingestion of alcohol and drugs, is barely plausible.” 
        
       
       
      
    35    The relationship evidence, and any errors made in dealing with it, go to the appellant’s mental state. But the admissions, the appellant’s conduct in ringing Father McCann and conversing with the persons he dealt with that night, point strongly towards the voluntariness of his conduct. In my judgment the evidence in the case apart from the relationship evidence made a conviction inevitable. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Voluntariness of Record of Interview 
      
    36    Ground 2 reads as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Evidence of admissions in the record of interview were not made voluntarily and were improperly admitted in evidence.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    37    The interview which was recorded took place between 3.40 am and 6.17 am on 7 May 1988.  
     
      
    38    The appellant’s submissions refer to Father McCann’s evidence about how his voice sounded during the telephone call at about 11.30 pm on 6 May 1988, Constable Ashton’s evidence that the appellant seemed stunned and smelled of liquor and that eleven Mogadon tablets were missing, Mr McClenahan’s evidence that the appellant was not inebriated and Dr Collits’ evidence that the appellant was inebriated. The appellant then set out calculations suggesting that each question during the interview took three minutes thirty-five seconds to answer, while in the witness box he answered each question in twenty seconds. He submitted that this showed that his ability to answer questions during the interview had been diminished to about ten percent of the ability he showed at the 1994 trial. The appellant also pointed to evidence that he was suffering from back pain in the early hours of 7 May. The appellant submitted that there was no evidence of what happened to him between 2 am and 3.20 am. He pointed to documentary material suggesting the inadvisability of taking Mogadon and alcohol simultaneously. 
     
      
    39    In my opinion this ground of appeal must fail. Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. No objection was taken to the record of interview at the second trial. Had an objection been taken, some of the conclusions which the appellant seeks to draw from a review of the evidence might have been more fully tested. For that reason, leave to pursue this ground should be refused. In any event, the record of interview, so far as it can be confirmed, is substantially correct. The police officers had no access to knowledge of the facts which can be confirmed other than through what the appellant told them. Though the appellant was not responding quickly to questions put by any of the persons he encountered on the night of 6-7 May 1988, the record of interview reveals that the appellant was giving rational answers. That is no doubt why the appellant’s counsel did not object to the tender of the record of interview, which to a large extent was exculpatory.  
     
      
    40    What was admitted in the record of interview goes no further than numerous earlier admissions to the same effect which are not challenged, so that even if the record of interview ought to have been excluded, the proviso should be applied. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 3 and 5: the DNA Evidence 
      
    41    Ground 3 is: 
     
      
       
        
        “DNA evidence is now available in relation to hair said to have been found in the deceased’s hand, which the appellant contends, had it been available at the time of his trial, in conjunction with photogrammetry evidence and the evidence of observations made at the post-mortem in relation to the hairs length and colour, it would tend to prove that the hair came from someone other than the appellant or the deceased and that the appellant has therefore been denied the opportunity of an acquittal that may have otherwise been open to him.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    42    Ground 5 complains of the refusal of defence counsel to carry out instructions given by the appellant for and during the trial resulting in a denial of the appellant’s rights and the withholding from the appellant and the court of DNA evidence that would have resulted in the accused’s acquittal.  
     
      
    43    In relation to ground 3 considered by itself, the first step in the appellant’s argument was to point to the opening of the Crown at the first trial to the effect that two clumps of hair found on the television room floor, and hair found in the deceased’s hand, were the victim’s hair, and that she had “very long hair and the accused much shorter”. Sergeant Steele said at the first trial that the average length was 20-25 centimetres, which was consistent with the deceased’s hair, as was the colour. 
     
      
    44    In 1994 Sergeant Steele said the hair in the deceased’s hand, when compared with the deceased’s hair, “was the same texture, colour and approximately 20-28 centimetres in length, which was average for the deceased’s head hair” (2/37.5 and 49.4-50.2). He also said the hair in her hand was different from the appellant’s (2/50.2-.5).  
     
      
    45    That evidence was supported by Sergeant O’Brien, who said the hair in the victim’s hand resembled her hair and not the appellant’s (3/418.7-.9). 
     
      
    46    However, though Sergeant Steele was not asked in chief about the two clumps of hair, in cross-examination he changed his 1990 evidence about the two clumps of hair. In 1994 he said that the hair in the two clumps was different from that of the victim, but not dissimilar from that of the appellant, though he admitted that he took no samples of the appellant’s hair (2/52.1-.5). He adhered to this in re-examination, basing that view on the texture, colouring and length of the hair, even though he made no specific comparison with the hair on the accused’s head (2/64.2).  
     
      
    47    The trial judge said in his summing up (page 75): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown says if you look at the objective facts, you look at what took place upstairs - a very violent attack upstairs, with up to 35 injuries perhaps excluding the final stabbing in the throat on the middle level, you look at the items of personal apparel there, the watch, the ring and the pendant, the Crown says you would have no doubt whatsoever that it was the accused that assaulted the victim. The Crown argues that if you add to that the fact that there was blood of the victim, the evidence of the knife attack, and add to that the fact that the knife which was produced was open, then the Crown says those objective facts together with the existence of little clumps of hair found upstairs, which the Crown says despite some conflict of the evidence were probably clumps of hair being pulled out by the deceased when she was perhaps being assaulted upstairs, you will have no doubt whatsoever, ladies and gentlemen, that the stabbing that took place ultimately on the middle level after the victim fled downstairs.” 
        
       
       
      The “conflict of evidence” is no doubt the conflict between Sergeant Steele and Sergeant O’Brien in relation to the two clumps of hair on the floor.  
       
      
    48    On 27 July 1994, just before the start of the second trial, the appellant’s solicitor requested tests of samples from the three clumps of hair and a sample from the appellant. The person conducting the tests was Dr Mathijs. On Sunday 31 July 1994 he told the solicitor: 
     
      
       
        
        “The specimen taken from the hair of Maurice Frawley recently contained an extra faint band … I am unable to see this band in the sample taken from the hand of the deceased.” 
        
       
       
      On 1 August 1994 he told the solicitor: 
       
        
        “The marker I referred to yesterday is puzzling. The hair is different and the sample found in the hair of the deceased does not look like that of Maurice Frawley. Further tests will be run tomorrow. The two specimens found in the TV room do not look the same - completely different. The only conclusion that I can presently come to is that there is a band in Frawley’s hair which was not in the hair found in the deceased’s hand and that the hair cannot be his.” 
        
       
       
      On 1 August 1994 a jury was empanelled, but the appellant’s counsel obtained an adjournment until the next day “on the basis that some inquiries were being pursued, the results of which may materially affect the way the case is conducted on behalf of the accused” (2/1). As the note of the solicitor for the Crown put it, this was because the defence were “awaiting results of DNA testing re hair samples”.  
       
       
        
       
      
    49    On 2 August 1994 the appellant’s solicitor was told the following matters by Dr Mathijs: 
     
      
       
        
        “The DNA is of poor quality and the results of the tests are inconclusive … There are differences but these are just ‘artifacts’. I will repeat the tests today … DNA decomposes over time in poor conditions and this may be an explanation for the differences in the test results … The three samples are too old, although the hair taken from Frawley is good.”  
        
       
       
      The appellant’s solicitor recollects that in later conversations Dr Mathijs expressed the view that further tests were inconclusive. No written report came into existence until 12 September 1994 (after the appellant had been convicted). A report by Dr Mathijs bearing that date said of a Y chromosome PCR test that “The conclusion from this test suggests that the four specimens are of male origin”. The report concluded: “The tests performed on these four (4) specimens do not generate a conclusion of exclusion of the suspect”. Dr Mathijs also provided a report on, apparently, 6 December 1995.  
       
      
    50    So far as Dr Mathijs’ 12 September 1994 test established that all the hair was of male origin, it showed that the police evidence about the hair in the deceased’s hand was incorrect. The appellant’s argument was that assuming that the police evidence that the hair in the deceased’s hand was not the appellant’s was correct; assuming that Dr. Mathijs was correct about the band in the appellant’s hair not being in the hair in the deceased’s hand; taking into account that the hair in the deceased’s hand cannot have been hers, since Dr Mathijs thought all the hair was from males; and noting that there was no evidence that any clumps of hair were missing from either the victim’s head or the appellant’s, the hair can only have been that of a third person - an intruder who lost it in the violent struggle preceding the killing of which he must have been the perpetrator.  
     
      
    51    The following difficulties exist with the argument. First, it depends in part on Dr Mathijs’ view about the band in the appellant’s hair: yet that was not a view he recorded in his 12 September 1994 report and it appears to have been withdrawn by his statement to the appellant’s solicitor on 2 August that “The DNA is of poor quality and the results of the tests are inconclusive”. Secondly, so far as the appellant’s argument depends on the statement in that report about all four samples being samples of male hair, it is unclear, by reason of the ambiguity in the word “suggests”, how confident Dr Mathijs was. Thirdly, on 6 December 1995 a second report of Dr Mathijs stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The quality of the DNA extracted from the specimens is very poor and, I believe that further tests will not generate a clear pattern. This may be due to a contamination of the hairs or severe breakdown of the nucleic material.” 
        
       
       
      Fourthly, so far as the appellant’s argument depends on some analogical conclusion of inadequate police investigations inferred from the fact that Sergeant Steele conceded at the first trial that “certain blood samples were perhaps not submitted for analysis because there was a known offender”, it has little materiality: so far as anything could be made of the matter, it was known to the appellant’s counsel at the second trial, and in any event the appellant’s submissions conceded, and there was evidence (3/419.9 and 455.3-.6), that relevant DNA testing was not possible in 1988. Fifthly, even if all the hair was male hair, the evidence only excludes the appellant if Sergeant O’Brien’s evidence that the clumps of hair on the floor were from the deceased is correct, and the evidence of both police officers that the hair in the victim’s hand was that of the deceased is correct. But that evidence cannot be correct if the DNA testing is correct: the police evidence was that, by a comparison with the victim’s hair, the hair in issue was hers rather than the appellant’s; yet the DNA evidence meant it cannot have been the victim’s hair since she was not male. The appellant’s argument is internally contradictory, in that part of it depends on the police evidence being correct, but another part depends on the same police evidence being incorrect. Finally, the appellant’s argument depends on exploiting particular parts of the DNA evidence while ignoring other parts. In order to judge whether untendered evidence would have made a difference at a trial, it is necessary to postulate that it be placed in admissible form. Even if Dr Mathijs’ oral utterances and his two reports had been available, they would not have been admitted, in a practical sense, without being distilled into a proof of evidence to which admissible oral evidence would have conformed. And in evaluating whether that evidence would have made a difference in the sense of creating a significant possibility that a reasonable jury could have acquitted, it is necessary to make some allowance for the inroads which a cross-examiner might reasonably be expected to make. A distillation of all Dr Mathijs’ utterances and reports into admissible oral evidence would probably have resulted in a statement by him of inability, once all his qualifications, doubts and ambiguities had been factored in, to arrive at an opinion excluding the appellant. And if his oral evidence had risen higher than that, it is very unlikely that it would have survived cross-examination. 
       
      
    52    So far as the appellant’s argument depends on the proposition that there is no evidence that either the victim or the appellant were missing clumps of hair, the difficulty is that there is no evidence that the clumps in question were of a sufficient size to leave noticeable gaps.  
     
      
    53    A further argument appeared to suggest that Dr. Mathijs’ report of 6 December 1995 indicated that samples of hair came from different people. It does not appear to do so: rather, it is inconclusive.  
     
      
    54    Among the difficulties with the police identification of the hair is that in part it depended on the use of photographs, in relation to which the use of artificial light may affect the appearance of the hair (2/49.8), and in part Sergeant Steele was not confident about identifying the colour of female hair (2/49.9). A further difficulty is that no sample of the appellant’s hair was taken in 1988 (2/51.1). The police officers also had only limited opportunities of observing the appellant’s hair in 1988 (2/30-31, 238 and 244; 3/392-393).  
     
      
    55    Without the DNA evidence, the hair evidence, confused as it was, was not such that the jury ought to have experienced a reasonable doubt. The DNA evidence, at best heavily qualified as it was, did not improve the appellant’s position. So far as it went, taken at its highest it tended to damage parts of already vulnerable police evidence which lacked any probative value either way, but other parts of that police evidence were needed if there were to be created a “significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, could have acquitted the [appellant] of the charge if the new evidence had been before it at the trial”: Gallagher v R (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 402; Mickelberg v R (1989) 167 CLR 259 at 288 and 301. Not only did the possibility appealed to depend in part on the vulnerable police evidence that the clumps of hair on the floor were not the appellant’s, but it had to be considered against the background of the rest of the evidence implicating the appellant, which was very strong. The weakness of the hair evidence, with or without DNA analysis, is so great that the jury would necessarily have to have looked to other material; the DNA analysis was too weak to cause a reasonable doubt to arise in the light of other material.  
     
      
    56    The parties put some effort during the appeal into establishing that the DNA evidence was, or was not, available or known to the appellant. The significance of this dispute was that if the evidence was “new” in the sense of being unavailable at the trial, the test was that stated in Gallagher v R (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 402, see above. If it was not “new” in that sense, the test was said to be more onerous. It seems that at least the following evidence was “new”: Dr Mathijs’ first report; Dr Mathijs’ view that all four samples of hair comprised hair from males (which was not communicated until his first report); and Dr Mathijs’ second report. Dr Mathijs’ view based on the band in the appellant’s hair was probably not “new”, but it was soon followed by his view that the results of the tests were inconclusive, communicated to the appellant’s solicitor on the first day of the trial, and thus the “band” evidence for practical purposes had a useful life of only a day or two: it could not have been deployed at the trial to any advantage. The material which came to the attention of the solicitor for the appellant in ensuing days from Dr Mathijs about the inconclusiveness of his further testing was not favourable and not useful to the appellant. There is a dispute between the appellant’s solicitor, who gave evidence to the effect that Dr Mathijs’ view of the inconclusive character of the tests was passed on to the appellant, who in turn gave instructions to proceed with the trial without raising the evidence of the DNA testing, and the appellant, who denied this. The contemporary documentation was extremely sparse and indecisive. It is not necessary to resolve this dispute about events occurring six years ago. It would suffice for the operation of any restrictive test based on the characterisation of evidence as not “new” that the appellant’s representatives were aware of the evidence but what they were aware of was not useful; what they were not aware of was “new”, but was not useful either. 
     
      
    57    Accordingly the DNA evidence appears to be too weak to permit ground 3 to succeed. 
     
      
    58    Turning to ground 5, the appellant’s written submissions complained that defence counsel “refused to carry out the appellant’s instructions given in writing prior to the trial and verbally during the trial and the appellant says that this was a denial of the appellant's rights and resulted in a guilty verdict instead of a not guilty verdict.” 
     
      
    59    On the appeal the appellant filed and read an affidavit dated 16 November 1999. Apart from referring to a request to his solicitor to apply for an adjournment of the second trial to allow the appellant to have a bowel operation, that affidavit did not refer to any written or oral instructions. In oral evidence on the appeal the appellant did not give evidence of any such instructions, though he did give evidence of having asked for the DNA results. Towards the end of the argument attention was directed to the fact that any instructions on which the appellant wished to rely on in the appeal had to be proved. The appellant was then re-sworn. He gave further evidence about his instructions on two matters. One concerned the tender of a page from an edition of what is known as MIMS, an annual publication which serves as a drug reference system for health care professionals in Australia, referring to the effects of Mogadon: the appellant said he gave instructions that the relevant edition be one near the time of the events in issue in 1988, not one near the time of the second trial. The page which the appellant wished to have tendered contained the following passages: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Precautions 
         As with other hypnotics, alcohol should be avoided while under the influence of the treatment, since the individual response cannot be foreseen … 
        
       
       
        
        Adverse Reactions 
         … Increased dreaming has been reported early in treatment. Slurred speech and poor coordination are uncommon.” 
        
       
      
    60    The other matter on which the appellant contended that instructions had been given concerned the tender of a demonstrative device in the nature of a wig made out of strips of coloured paper of various lengths which the appellant wished his counsel to have placed on his head, so as to show the radical difference between hair of the length which the appellant said he had in 1988 and hair of the length which the police evidence attributed to the victim in 1988. No evidence of any written instructions beyond the relevant page from MIMS was tendered.  
     
      
    61    Forming a judgment about the reliability of any testimony given by the appellant years after the events in issue would be difficult. The effects of the grave health difficulties from which the appellant has suffered since about 1986 and the effects of the abuse of alcohol for most of his adult life until 1988, not to mention the effects of the twelve years which the appellant has spent in gaol, are such that his powers of observation, recall and concentration may be gravely defective. His demeanour while giving evidence and presenting argument gives strength to those possibilities. It seems very likely that inherent in his convictions is the fact that two juries have rejected key aspects of his evidence. In the circumstances it is undesirable to make any findings about what the appellant did in relation to instructions unless absolutely necessary.  
     
      
    62    Assuming, without deciding, that the appellant did give instructions to seek an adjournment on health grounds, and assuming, without deciding, that no application was made (these being propositions which the appellant’s solicitor did not deny in his affidavit read by the Crown, but was not cross-examined about by the appellant’s counsel), it has not been demonstrated that that failure affected the outcome of the second trial.  
     
      
    63    Assuming, without deciding, that the appellant gave particular instructions about the page from MIMS, and assuming, without deciding, that if given they were not carried out (these being propositions which the appellant’s solicitor, who heard them being advanced in oral evidence, was not called by the Crown to deny), it has not been demonstrated that that affected the outcome of the second trial. The tender of one page of MIMS rather than another in relation to the effects of mixing alcohol and Mogadon and other effects of Mogadon can have had no impact in a trial in which expert evidence was given about the effect of alcohol and drugs on the accused apart and in combination. Dr Judith Perl was called by the Crown to give evidence on that subject. Dr Wong, who was called by the Crown, gave some evidence about it in cross-examination. Dr G B Chesher was called by the appellant to give evidence about it. So was Professor G A Starmer. It would be a matter for the latter two witnesses in particular to suggest what documents should be tendered, or what information based on documents should be conveyed to the court testimonially. If their evidence was not enough to carry the day, a page from MIMS would not have turned the scales.  
     
      
    64    The final matter is the appellant’s instructions about the device demonstrating different hair lengths. The employment of such a device was entirely within the discretion of defence counsel. Assuming, but not deciding, both that the instructions were given and that they were not complied with (these being propositions which the appellant’s solicitor referred to in evidence during the appeal but which he was not called by the Crown to deny), the failure to comply with them could not have caused any miscarriage of justice. The hair evidence was confused. The police officers giving evidence on hair agreed that the hair in the victim’s hand was hers. The police evidence was contradictory in relation to the hair in the two clumps: Sergeant Steele said that it was the appellant’s, Sergeant O’Brien said it was the victim’s. While Sergeant Steele’s tenuous evidence was mildly adverse to the appellant, Sergeant O’Brien’s evidence did not exclude him. If the appellant’s hair was shorter than the victim’s, that supported Sergeant O’Brien. It was a matter for the judgment of defence counsel how the hair issue should be handled. The appellant’s solicitor gave evidence that in his judgment, while the appellant’s hair was much shorter in 1994 than in 1988, in 1988 his hair was fifteen centimetres long in parts. That may well have caused counsel to regard it as a dangerous issue to highlight. Defence counsel’s task in arriving at an appropriate tactical judgment was a difficult one, given the appellant’s professed inability to remember anything about whether he had or had not fought with the victim. Neither the evidence called from the police officers nor the DNA evidence not called excluded the appellant and supported the intruder theory. Neither counsel appears to have addressed about it in a manner leaving more than a trace in the summing up, which scarcely mentions hair. The use of the device demonstrating different hair lengths could not in these circumstances have been such as to bring into existence a significant chance of acquittal which did not otherwise exist.  
     
      
    65    The appellant made a related complaint concerning his counsel’s failure to cross-examine Sergeant Steele about his change of evidence and about his prior evidence in the 1990 trial. The appellant submitted in his 9 August 1999 submissions that he gave written instructions about Sergeant Steele’s 1990 evidence. There is no evidence of these instructions. He also submitted that he instructed his solicitor that he wanted his counsel to read to Sergeant Steele the 1990 evidence, but counsel “refused to carry out the appellant’s instructions”. There is no evidence of these instructions. If they were given, there are understandable reasons why they were not carried out. Counsel did press Sergeant Steele (2/52.1-.7 and 56.2-.4), but without success. Counsel may well have thought that to have pressed him further might make the evidence both more firm and more likely to strike the jury as significant. As it happened, the re-examination weakened the evidence given in cross-examination (2/64.2), but counsel was not to know that this would happen. The Crown evidently did not see the evidence as pointing to guilt, since it failed to elicit it in chief from Sergeant Steele. Defence counsel may well have thought that to put to Sergeant Steele his evidence at the first trial could have had the undesirable by-product of reminding the jury more than was necessary that one jury had already found the Crown case proved beyond reasonable doubt. Defence counsel had made an unsuccessful application for discharge of the jury because of a reference to the first trial (2/99).  
     
      
    66    Some of the appellant’s complaints relate to not being told of the DNA evidence. While the appellant gave evidence that he asked his lawyers “at different times at the start of the trial about the DNA results” and was told that they were not available, there is no evidence to suggest that any helpful version of them was available. There is no evidence that the appellant’s legal representatives learned of the 12 September 1994 report before the end of the trial. The appellant’s solicitor gave evidence that he did not receive it until 15 September 1994, and there is no evidence to the contrary. Hence there is no basis for the appellant’s submission that his lawyers deceived him about it, let alone any basis for his submission that his lawyers were engaged in a conspiracy with the Crown lawyers to suppress it. On the evidence, all that the appellant’s lawyers heard after the false hopes raised on the weekend before the trial about the appellant’s hair being different from the two clumps found on the floor and the hair in the victim’s hand was that the results were inconclusive.  
     
      
    67    Whether the appellant is correct in saying that this information was not passed on to him, or whether the appellant’s solicitor is correct in saying that it was and that he gave instructions to proceed without DNA evidence does not matter. This is because even if there was a failure on the part of the appellant’s lawyers to tender whatever DNA evidence they had available, and even if it were all available, it would not have made a difference. The appellant submitted: “In fact … Det. Sgt. O’Brien’s evidence and Det. Sgt. Steele’s original evidence together with the DNA report shows/proves the appellant’s innocence”. That is not so for the reasons given in paragraph 51 above.  
     
      
    68    The reliance of the appellant on the grounds related to DNA evidence essentially operates to support the conclusion that there was a reasonable doubt whether or not an intruder killed the victim. Other points to the same effect were advanced.  
     
      
    69    One argument was that the appellant’s recollection of the victim saying she had scratched his face, coupled with the absence of scratches, pointed to her having scratched an intruder. This argument was available at the trial and depended in part on the jury’s estimation of the appellant’s reliability. They were entitled to reject his reliability. 
     
      
    70    Another argument was that there was evidence of blood stains in parts of the house outside the areas where the assault took place. That blood was not sent for testing. The appellant submitted that it was possible that the victim’s dog bit her attacker, and that this could have caused some of the blood. He submitted that the failure of the police to have all the blood tested deprived him of a means of establishing his innocence. By themselves, these arguments would not inevitably raise a reasonable doubt; they do not do so even taken with others; they were available at the trial; if counsel chose not to run them, that was an understandable course; and if the jury chose to reject them, that was understandable also.  
     
      
    71    A further issue, raised only in reply, concerned a piece of finger nail found in the victim’s hair. The appellant submitted the evidence showed that it came neither from the victim nor from him, and this proves that there was an intruder. It was the jury’s task to determine what was found and what the explanation of the finding was. The evidence pointed to does not suggest that the jury ought to have experienced a reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    72    In short, to the extent that the appellant’s submissions on the DNA tests included arguments advanced that do not depend on the DNA tests, they were available at the time of the trial on the basis of the evidence given and they do not suggest any miscarriage of justice. The same is true of other arguments in those submissions which depend on evidence not called at the trial and which are not the subject of any ground of appeal.  
     
      
    73    I would reject ground 5 as well as ground 3. Even if those grounds were made out, the strength of the remaining evidence calls for application of the proviso.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4: Dr Wong’s Evidence 
      
    74    This ground was that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Dr Wong’s evidence should not have been allowed because the circumstance surrounding his interview with the appellant renders his evidence … inadmissible.” 
        
       
      
    75    The interview referred to was an interview between Dr Wong, a forensic psychiatrist called by the Crown, on 6 November 1988. Putting aside many irrelevant submissions in support of this ground, it is necessary to deal with the following. The appellant contended that he was bullied by his then counsel into attending the interview and that he did not in reality consent to it. (The counsel in question was not the counsel who appeared on the first appeal and at the second trial, nor the counsel who appeared on the second appeal). The appellant submitted that Dr Wong should have been prevented from giving evidence derived from the medical examination. The appellant also submitted in effect that because the trial judge at the first trial prevented Dr Wong from giving the history which the appellant had given him, the trial judge at the second trial should have done the same. The appellant further submitted that Dr Wong should not have been permitted to give “an opinion on intent” because “no person is able to say what another person is thinking”. 
     
      
    76    This ground should be rejected for the following reasons. 
     
      
    77    First, so far as the argument depends on the appellant having been bullied by counsel, it lacks any evidentiary foundation: the appellant made no reference to this in either his affidavit or his oral evidence in chief on his return to the witness box towards the end of the argument on appeal. 
     
      
    78    Secondly, the appellant’s counsel at the second trial did not object to Dr Wong’s evidence on any of the grounds advanced save that he objected to questions about the appellant’s sanity which the Crown then withdrew. There is no reason why leave should be granted pursuant to Rule 4.  
     
      
    79    Thirdly, there was no identification of which particular answers fell foul of the supposed rule against giving an “opinion of intent”.  
     
      
    80    Finally, it is unclear why the trial judge at the first trial rejected the evidence of history, and on the face of it it seems that he was not correct to do so, except perhaps as an act of generosity to an unrepresented litigant on a murder charge.

    81    In my opinion the appeal against both conviction and sentence should be dismissed.

     REGINA v. GREGORY ALLAN MAGRIN 
      
     REGINA v. GRAEME JOSEPH WATSON 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   MASON, P: I invite Greg James, J. to deliver the first judgment. 
    2   GREG JAMES, J: Both of these matters are appeals by the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of sentences imposed in the District Court by his Honour Judge Ford. It is convenient to deal with both together. 
    3   The appeals are brought under s.5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It is asserted in respect of each sentence that it is inadequate. I understand that it is intended to assert by this that the sentences were ""in error in point of principle"", as is referred to by Sir Garfield Barwick in Griffiths v. The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293 at 310 and if allowed to stand would be productive of the kind of manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing standards as is referred to by the High Court in Everett v. The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 300. Appeals brought in those circumstances are appeals in which the Director exercises the exceptional power vested in him by s.5D to invoke the court's function to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of sentencing courts in such circumstances as apply in the instant cases. 
    4   It is the submission made here, and as I understand it underlying the appeal, that each of the sentences is in their duration and nature so far outside the permissible range of the exercise of a proper discretion by the sentencing judge as to require the intervention by this court and that, notwithstanding the exercise of the court's well known discretion either to refrain from intervening or, on intervention, to pass a substituted sentence less than that which might otherwise have been appropriate at first instance. 
    5   The principles relating to appeals in these circumstances have been set forth in such authorities as The Queen v. Allpass (1994) 72 A. Crim. R. 561; The Queen v. Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2. 
    6   Insofar as the appeal is an appeal against a discretionary judgment below, it is necessary to have regard to the performance by the primary judge of a discretionary function in which, in the intuitive synthesis required, that judge balances the various appropriate matters to be taken into account on sentence. The judge's findings of fact are not brought in question on such an appeal unless they are insupportable. However, in the event that there was error below, even though the precise nature of that error cannot be identified, this court might intervene (Cranssen v. The King (1936) 55 CLR 509 at 519 to 520). 
    7   In Histollo v. The Director General of National Parks and Wildlife Services (CCA, unreported 10 December 1998), the court examined rights of appeal to this court and in particular referred to what had been said concerning appeals in relation to sentence by Hunt, CJ. at CL. in The Queen v. Symonds (1995) 79 A. Crim. R. 31 at 35. There, his Honour pointed out that the appeal is not by way of re-hearing and this court does not re-canvass findings for which an adequate basis existed below. 
    8   Again, in The Queen v Kurtic (1996) 85 A. Crim. R. 57, this court returned to that theme, concluding that this court sits as a Court of Appeal, not for the purpose of re-hearing evidence to re-determine facts, but for dealing with error of law. 
    9   In the present case, it is contended that the sentences were in error. In the case of Mr. Watson, after his plea of not guilty to the offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm, for which a maximum of seven years imprisonment is provided, there was a lengthy trial. He was found guilty and was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention. He had been charged with the aggravated form of the maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm offence but the jury did not find the element involved in that offence, that is, that he intended the infliction of grievous bodily harm. 
    10   Mr. Magrin was charged with being an accessory to the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm, that offence too was punishable by a maximum of seven years imprisonment. To that offence, after the trial, which for medical reasons he was unable to attend, he pleaded guilty. The Crown accepted that plea in full discharge of an indictment which had originally, as with Mr. Watson, charged him with the more serious offence. Having regard to 52 days pre-trial custody, the trial judge sentenced him to imprisonment for 16 months, involving a minimum term of 12 months and an additional term of four months. 
    11   At trial, two co-accused, Messrs. Foxton and Hamilton, were also found guilty of offences arising from their involvement in a plan to have the victim, Mr. Hank Baard, assaulted by one Faber who, the trial judge found, inflicted upon the victim with considerable brutally the most appalling injuries which caused permanent brain damage and sight defects. 
    12   The Crown, in its submissions to this court, refers to the sentences passed upon those others, Messrs. Foxton and Hamilton. Mr. Foxton was sentenced to imprisonment for 20 months with a minimum term of 15 months; Mr. Hamilton to receive the benefit of the deferral of sentence upon a recognisance under s.558 of the Crimes Act 1900 for a period of three years coupled with supervision. 
    13   In his remarks on sentence, the trial judge referred to the injuries sustained by the victim as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""Those injuries were, to put it mildly, very, very serious, so much so that he has lost the sight in his right eye and there seems to be no question that that eye will be excised at some time or another and replaced by a glass eye or artificial eye. The details of the injuries sustained by Mr. Baard are set out in a report from Dr. Vera Veerabangsa of the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Unit at Liverpool. That report refers to the serious injury to his eye and generally speaking the serious injury to the head of Mr. Baard, who for example suffered a compound fracture of the left frontal bone with underlying extradural haematoma and left frontal lobe contusion and subarachnoid haemorrhage, extensive fractures of mid facial bones and right eye injury and a fractured left clavicle."" 
       
      
    14   His long term injuries were set out in victims' impact statements that were tendered in evidence, which were provided not only by the victim himself but also by his daughter. 
    15   The long-term results of the attack upon the victim, who suffers problems with memory, blood pressure, loss of taste and smell, the necessity for daily medication, his larynx no longer functions which interferes with his ability to swallow, he is blind in one eye and is no longer to work in his chosen occupation. 
    16   His Honour further described the events by reference to the evidence given by the attacker who, following his plea of guilty and sentence, gave evidence for the Crown. That description includes the attacker using a baseball bat which he had concealed under his jumper and kicking, punching and beating the victim, including beating him with the baseball bat about the head so as to occasion the injuries to which I have referred. His Honour also described the assault as vicious. It undoubtedly was. 
    17   It is not necessary on this appeal to discuss the distinctions between the count of conspiracy to maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with which the co-accused were charged and the counts against the two respondents, one of which expressly pleaded accessoryship to infliction of grievous bodily harm, the other of which implicitly embraced it. 
    18   The facts which the Crown contends may be extracted from his Honour's reasons and which it is submitted his Honour found in consequence of the evidence given at trial in the case of Mr. Watson it would appear, from that evidence and the statement of agreed facts, tendered in the case of Mr. Magrin, showed the circumstances in which the assailant came to inflict those injuries. It was disclosed that Messrs. Foxton and Hamilton, apparently for reasons arising out of their participation in the activities of a fishing club, conceived an antipathy to the victim, the president of that club, in consequence of having been caught cheating and having been stripped of points they had earned in a club fishing competition. Mr. Foxton apparently sought widely for a person to assault the victim. Having made contact with the assailant himself, Mr. Foxton then utilised the services of Mr. Magrin in respect of the negotiations as to what would occur. There was a meeting between the assailant Faber and Mr. Watson, the assailant's neighbour, with Mr Magrin and another person on 26 April 1998, in which arrangements were discussed to carry out the assault in return for a payment of some $2000. It would appear that that sum of $2000 was to be the total financial reward for Messrs. Magrin, Watson and Faber and on this appeal the Crown has conceded that the lion's share probably went to the assailant, although it is not possible to stipulate who was to get how much. 
    19   Following these arrangements, there was a meeting at a club when some $500 were passed over and Magrin identified the victim to Faber and Watson. A joint plan was devised which embraced the idea that the victim would be assaulted as he walked alone underneath a bridge and the assault made to look like a robbery. There was discussion between Foxton and Faber concerning Foxton's hatred of the victim. 
    20   When Faber, the assailant, gave evidence at the trial, he made reference to discussions with Hamilton concerning ""it would be a bonus"" if the victim was ""hospitalised"". At points in the transcript there is reference to ""kneecapping"". There was reference too, to a suggestion made to those involved that the victim was a sex offender, apparently to afford some justification for what was about to happen to him. There was no evidence or basis to suggest the victim was any such thing. The allegation was a complete fabrication. 
    21   When the victim left the club, he was followed by Faber, the assailant, Watson and Magrin. Faber and Watson went to Watson's car, where Faber armed himself with a baseball bat which however he kept concealed up his jumper. He removed the bat from concealment when he approached the victim and assaulted him as I have described. After the attack, Watson drove the assailant from the scene and later assisted in the disposal of the baseball bat and other clothing. 
    22   Certain of his Honour's findings of fact were to some extent in greater detail than this terse summary. In particular, his Honour set out the background to the antipathy felt by Messrs. Foxton and Hamilton towards the victim, the injuries, the evidence of Mr. Faber as to what he had done to the victim. His Honour refers in detail to the evidence for consideration of what intent or state of mind the offenders had at the time of the crime. He found finds the following:- 
     
      
       
       ""The reason I refer in detail to the evidence is simply this, that that was an extraordinarily brutal attack made by Mr. Faber but I do not think it was the sort of attack that was anticipated or contemplated by any of the persons who are before the court here today. What I am sure they wanted, the present prisoners, was that there should be a certain degree of roughing up of the victim, Mr. Baard. I cannot imagine they ever had any idea that Mr. Faber would take a baseball bat and use it to inflict the extraordinarily severe injuries which Mr. Baard has sustained."" 
       
      
    23   In his particular findings in respect of Messrs. Watson and Magrin, his Honour as to Watson found that although he assisted Faber by driving him away from the scene of the crime, he was not present at the actual crime and held that the general finding to which I have referred was applicable to his individual case.  
    24   In the matter of Magrin, his Honour referred to Magrin making the necessary arrangements to admit the persons to the club, supervising the departure and following in order to carry out the undertaking. His Honour holds:- 
     
      
       
       ""I do not believe that you ever imagined that Baard would suffer the injuries sustained at the hands of Faber."" 
       
      
    25   His Honour referred to the fact, in that context, that Mr. Magrin has a borderline intellectual impairment. His Honour held that Mr. Magrin was aware there would be the attack by Mr. Faber and makes that finding but in the context of the earlier findings to which I have referred.  
    26   In the facts that were presented on the plea by Mr. Magrin, there is reference to the arrangement by Mr. Magrin for the assault to be carried out. However, at no point in those facts is there, at least expressly, any matter which would suggest that his Honour's finding was not open to him to make. It has not been suggested in the submissions both written and oral by the Crown that it was not open to his Honour to make a finding which it appears he did that the prisoners did not intend that there be such injuries inflicted but indeed intended that there should be that certain degree of roughing up his Honour adverted to, to which I have referred. 
    27   On argument in the appeal, the Crown's attention was drawn to the decision of this Court in The Queen v. Stokes & Difford (1990) 51 A. Crim. R. 25 to define the legal content of the offences with which the trial judge was concerned. In summary, that decision holds that the offence is committed if the accused knew that the principal intended to strike the victim and that the principal intended to inflict some physical injury on the victim, or realised that some such injury might result and with that knowledge the accused encouraged the principal to commit the offence. 
    28   It would appear in those circumstances, that decision being accepted by the Crown as applicable here, that his Honour's findings are not out of accord with the verdict of the jury or the plea. Nonetheless it is submitted by the Crown that the consequences of the conduct of the retained assailant were such as to show that his Honour had failed to translate his findings on the severity of the injuries and the brutality of the assault into the sentences he had passed so that those sentences were unduly lenient. It is put that there was nothing in the subjective features to which his Honour referred which would have justified what is asserted to be a considerable degree of leniency. It is further put that the participation by the two respondents in the offence for the sake of financial reward put the matter in the worst category of case by analogy from the reasoning in cases involving the imposition of the sentence of life imprisonment for offences of murder. No comparison is possible or validly made with the sentence passed upon the assailant since he was charged with the offence under s.33 under of the Crimes Act 1900 which is punishable by a maximum of a totally different order. 
    29   The specific submissions made by the Crown in relation to each of the two respondents were, in the case of Mr. Magrin, that he was a willing and active participant in a plot to bash, that in the case of Mr. Watson that, although he furnished assistance to the authorities, a matter to which his Honour properly had regard and although he did not have the prior record that affected Mr. Magrin, nonetheless he contemplated a degree of harm, and carried out a role, which involved active participation such as to be analogous to that of the driver in a getaway car in an armed robbery. It was put that for him there could only be a matter of limited mitigation, in his not having actually participated in the attack.  
    30   The submissions advanced on behalf of the Crown fail in my view to have regard to his Honour's detailed and specific findings relating to the individual involvement and contemplation of each of the two respondents. This Court does not sit to overturn such findings if there is evidence to support them as there was here. 
    31   Given the role of each of the respondents and given the findings as to what they each contemplated, I am not persuaded that the sentences are so far beyond the range of a proper sentence, even if it could be argued that they did exceed that range which I do not think it can that the appeal should be upheld. 
    32   There is a further matter. There is no Crown appeal in respect of the sentences passed upon Messrs. Hamilton and Foxton. For my part, I would regard that as a relevant matter on the question of this court exercising discretion to intervene in the event that I were of the view that the sentences were otherwise appealable under s.5D. However, in my view, it is not necessary to resolve the issue of whether parity should be examined as a matter going to the sufficiency of the sentence below or a discretion not to intervene in this case. 
    33   In all the circumstances I am of the view that each appeal should be dismissed. 
    34   MASON, P: I agree. 
    35   LEVINE, J: I agree. 
    36   MASON, P: That is the order of the court.

    CRIMINAL LAW - whether intellectually disabled accused fit to be tried - trial Judge terminated enquiry as to fitness and discharged accused - Judge failed to fully consider procedures under governing legislation - decision not supported by governing legislation - application for remedy in the nature of prerogative relief - Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, s 10(4) - Mental Health Act 1990 (NSW), Ch 5 Part 2The first opponent was charged with sexual assault aggravated by occasioning actual bodily harm. Both the opponent and the victim are intellectually disabled and the offence was alleged to have occurred at a Department of Community Services house where they were both living at the time. The Solicitor-General directed an enquiry as to the fitness of the opponent to be tried pursuant to s 8 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (the Act). At a hearing before Moore DCJ the opponent successfully applied under s 10(4) of the Act for the hearing to be abandoned, for the charge to be dismissed, and for an order that he be released. The DPP appealed, moving that the Judge’s decision be quashed either for want of jurisdiction or for error of law on the face of the record.HELD, (by majority) granting the application, (1) The Judge erred in finding that the procedures under the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 were not likely to produce a useful result. An examination of its provisions and the related provisions in Chapter 5 Part 2 of the Mental Health Act 1990 established the contrary. (2) The Judge erred in his approach to exercising the power under s 10(4) of the Mental Health Act 1990 because his Honour’s orders were not supported by an opinion expressed in the terms of the statute. Section 10(4) does not authorise the summary termination of the proceedings merely because the Judge considers that they are inappropriate having regard to the nature of the person’s disability. The condition for making the order depends instead on the Court forming the opinion that “it is inappropriate having regard to … the nature of the person’s disability … to inflict any punishment …”. (3) The Judge erred in dismissing the enquiry on an assumption that the nature of the opponent’s disability would preclude a verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness. The alternative verdict that on the limited evidence available the opponent committed the offence charged may have been open which would have authorised the imposition of a limiting term, making the opponent a forensic patient subject to the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. (4) The errors of law identified appeared on the face of the Judge’s reasons and therefore on the face of the record. They demonstrated that his Honour exceeded his authority and fell into jurisdictional error because he misconceived the nature of the function he was to perform.

      DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (NSW) v JOHN WILLIAM MILLS & ANOR 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
    1    MEAGHER JA: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of Handley JA. I disagree with it. 
    2    This is an application for an order in the nature of certiori to quash an order made by Moore DCJ purportedly under s.10(4) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. The statutory background, and the relevant facts, are set out in his Honour’s judgment. 
    3    The Statute is, quite clearly, in drastic need of amendment. In the first place, whilst it has provisions in the event that a jury finds an accused person fit to be tried, and other provisions in the event that a jury finds an accused person unfit to be tried, there is no provision for the situation which emerged in the instant case, viz., when a jury is unable to agree on the question of fitness to plead. 
    4    Even more urgent is the need for the legislation to tell us what exactly is meant in s.10(4) by the words “it is inappropriate…to inflict any punishment.” 
    5    It is clear enough that the process envisaged by s.10(4), a process of dismissing the charge and ordering a release, is one which must take place, if at all, before any trial takes place. 
    6    However, except in Alice in Wonderland, and possibly in the Republic of China, no question of punishment can arise until there has been a trial resulting in a conviction. 
    7    There is therefore, something a little odd about speculating on the appropriateness of punishment before any question of punishment can arise. 
    8    The only solution to this problem I can envisage is to read the subsection as if it said “inappropriate…on the assumption that the accused had been found fit to plead, tried and convicted, to inflict any punishment”. And “punishment” (which, needless to say, has no statutory definition) I should think refers to imprisonment or other custodial sentence or pecuniary penalty. 
    9    In the present case, Moore DCJ, after considering the provisions of the subsection, said: 
     
      
       
       “The subsection necessarily indicates that it is only in the interests of justice (as it affects the community in general and the accused and the particular member of the community affected, mainly the victim which I think it is proper to consider) that the subsection ought to be applied.” 
       
      
    10    Thus, there can, in my view, be no doubt that his Honour thought that he was exercising jurisdiction under s.10(4), as he was asked to do by counsel for the accused. That his Honour did not repeat the statutory mantra “inappropriate” or “appropriate” is beside the point. If he, on due consideration, thought it would be inimical to the interests of justice to inflict any punishment on the accused, he must have thought punishment was “inappropriate”. The fact that I regard his decision as catastrophic, and the further fact that I think his Honour’s reasoning was utterly unintelligible, does not detract from that conclusion. He was exercising his jurisdiction, however ineptly. 
    11    In my view, the summons should be dismissed with costs. 
    12    HANDLEY JA: The Director of Public Prosecutions has moved for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash a decision of Moore DCJ given in purported exercise of the power conferred by s 10(4) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (the Act). The first opponent (the opponent), John William Mills, was charged with the offence of sexual assault aggravated by occasioning actual bodily harm. The indictment alleged that on 6 October 1998 at Smithfield in the State the opponent had sexual intercourse with Phuong Nguyen, without her consent, knowing she was not consenting, and at the time of the commission of the offence John William Mills did maliciously inflict actual bodily harm upon Phuong Nguyen. The offence was alleged to have occurred at a Department of Community Services house at 8 Cassandra Avenue, Smithfield where the opponent and the victim were living at the time. Both are intellectually disabled. 
    13    The Solicitor-General, acting as the delegate of the Attorney General, directed, pursuant to s 8 of the Act, an enquiry as to the fitness of the opponent to be tried. The enquiry came on for hearing on 21 February 2000 before Mitchelmore DCJ and a jury who were unable to reach a decision and were discharged. The enquiry came on for hearing again on 1 May 2000 before Moore DCJ. Prior to the enquiry commencing, counsel for the opponent made an application under s 10(4) of the Act that the Court determine that it was inappropriate to conduct an enquiry and that the charge should be dismissed and the opponent released. In an extempore judgment the Judge granted the application and made those orders. 
    14    Counsel for the Director has submitted that the Judge’s decision should be quashed either for want of jurisdiction or for error of law on the face of the record. Section 69(4) of the Supreme Court Act, inserted following the decision in Craig v South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163, provides that the record of a court or tribunal which may be reviewed in certiorari proceedings includes the reasons for the decision of that court or tribunal. 
    15    The procedure on an enquiry as to the fitness of an accused person to be tried on a criminal charge is provided for in s 10. Sub s (4) provides: 
     
      
       
       “If, in respect of a person charged with an offence, the court is of the opinion that it is inappropriate, having regard to the trivial nature of the charge or offence, the nature of the person’s disability or any other matter which the court thinks proper to consider, to inflict any punishment the court may determine not to conduct an enquiry and may dismiss the charge and order that the person be released”. 
       
      
      
       
      
    16    In his reasons for judgment Moore DCJ reviewed the steps which the Act requires to be taken following a finding that an accused person is not fit to be tried. These are complex but it is not necessary to refer to all the procedural steps provided for because it was common ground before Mitchelmore DCJ and Moore DCJ that the opponent was not fit to be tried by reason of his mental disability and that his condition would not improve. 
    17    If on an enquiry under s 8 the jury (or a judge if the jury is dispensed with) determines that an accused person is unfit to be tried, the court is required by s 14 to refer that person to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) to determine whether he will become fit to be tried within the period of 12 months following the finding of unfitness. If the Tribunal determines that the person will not become fit to be tried during this period, it is required by s 16(4) to notify the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Under s 18 the Attorney General, after receiving and considering the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions, may direct that a special hearing be conducted in respect of the offence. If the Attorney General directs a special hearing, the appropriate court is required by s 19(1) to conduct it “for the purpose of ensuring, despite the unfitness of the person to be tried in accordance with the normal procedures, that the person is acquitted unless it can be proved to the requisite criminal standard of proof that, on the limited evidence available, the person committed the offence charged or any other offence available as an alternative to the offence charged”.  
    18    The conduct of the special hearing is provided for in s 21. Sub s (1) provides that it is to be conducted as nearly as possible as if it were a trial of criminal proceedings, and sub s (2) requires the accused to be represented unless the court otherwise allows. Sub s (3)(c) entitles the accused to raise any defence that could properly be raised if the special hearing were an ordinary trial and under sub para (d) the accused is entitled to give evidence. Section 22(1) provides: 
     
      
       
       “The verdicts available to the jury or the court at a special hearing include the following: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) Not guilty of the offence charged; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) Not guilty on the ground of mental illness; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (c) That on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed the offence charged; 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (d) That on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed an offence available as an alternative to the offence charged”. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
        
       
      
    19    It is not clear that the opponent’s mental disability would support a verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness. It was common ground on this application that, in this State, the legal principles to be applied in determining whether a jury (or a judge if the jury has been dispensed with) is entitled to find a verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness are those determined by the common law. Section 38 makes this clear because it refers to this as a defence “according to law” without defining what that law is. The second answer of the Judges to the House of Lords following the acquittal of M’Naghten included the following passage (see Stapleton v The Queen (1952) 86 CLR 358, 371): 
     
      
       
       “… it must be clearly proved that at the time of the committing of the act the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong … If the accused was conscious that the act was one which he ought not to do … he is punishable; and the usual course therefore has been to leave the question to the jury, whether the party accused had a sufficient degree of reason to know that he was doing an act which was wrong …”. 
       
      
      
       
      
    20    In Stapleton v The Queen (ibid at 372) Dixon CJ, Webb and Kitto JJ continued: 
     
      
       
       “Only a few months after the judges had advised the House of Lords in M’Naghten’s case it fell to Maule J to give a direction to a jury on a defence of insanity. The case is  
       Reg v Higginson 
        (1843) 1 Car & K 129, 130 [174 ER 743, 744]. Maule J said:- ‘If you are satisfied that the prisoner committed this offence, but you are also satisfied by the evidence that, at the time of the committing of the offence, the prisoner was so insane that he did not know right from wrong, he should be acquitted on that ground; but if you think that, at the time of the committing of the offence, he did know right from wrong, he is responsible for his acts, although he is of weak intellect”. 
       
      
      
       
      
    21    The second answer of the Judges to the House of Lords suggests that the critical question is not the cause of “the defect of reason”, but “whether the party accused had a sufficient degree of reason (from whatever cause) to know that he was doing an act which was wrong”, and this is confirmed by the direction given by Maule J in the second passage quoted. In other words the existence of insanity or a disease of the mind is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for this defence which is also available where the defect of reason is congenital or due to injury. 
    22    This question was referred to by counsel, but the Court did not hear full argument on it, and it need not be decided in these proceedings. It is possible that a jury (or the judge as the case may be) at a special hearing may decline to find the opponent not guilty on the ground of mental illness and may return a verdict that on the limited evidence available he committed the offence charged. The effect of a finding that an accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness is provided for in s 39. The court is required to order that the person be detained in such place and in such manner as the court thinks fit until released by due process of law. Such persons become forensic patients as defined by Schedule 1 of the Mental Health Act 1990 and are then dealt with under Chapter 5 Part 2 of that Act. 
    23    If the special hearing results in a verdict that on the limited evidence available the accused committed the offence, he must be dealt with in accordance with s 23. The court is required to determine whether, if the special hearing had been a normal trial, it would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment or penal servitude ( s 23(1)(a)). Where the court would have done this, it is required by s 23 (1)(b) to nominate a term, referred to as “a limiting term” in respect of that offence, being its best estimate of the sentence the court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial. 
     
      
       
      
    24    If the court nominates a limiting term it is required by s 24 to refer the person to the Tribunal and make such order with respect to his custody as the court thinks appropriate. The Tribunal must determine whether the person is suffering from mental illness or from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital (s24(2)) and must then notify the court (s 24(3)). 
    25    An accused person, who has been made the subject of an order imposing a limiting term and been detained in a hospital or other place, becomes a forensic patient as defined in the Mental Health Act 1990 who must be reviewed by the Tribunal pursuant to Chapter 5 Part 2 of that Act. Section 80(2) requires the Tribunal, as soon as practicable after the making of any such order, to review the forensic patient’s case and inter alia determine whether his safety, or that of any member of the public, will be seriously endangered by his release (s 80 (2)(b)). Section 80 (4) provides that if the Tribunal is of the opinion that the safety of the forensic patient, or any member of the public, will not be seriously endangered by his release it must make a recommendation to the Minister for his release. 
    26    The Tribunal has a continuing duty to review each forensic patient at least once every six months and may make a recommendation to the Minister “as to the patient’s release (either unconditionally or subject to conditions)” (s 82(1)(c)), but is not to do so unless it is satisfied, on the evidence available to it, that the safety of the patient, or any member of the public, will not be seriously endangered by his release (s82 (4)). 
    27    The Minister is required by s 83 to notify the Attorney General of any recommendation by the Tribunal for the release of a forensic patient, but s 84(1) provides that he is not to be released if, within 30 days after being notified of the recommendation, the Attorney General objects to the person’s release on the ground that “the person has served insufficient time in custody or under detention” (s 84(1)(a)).  
    28    A finding that the opponent was not fit to be tried for this offence would therefore have led to further steps being taken under the Act. These may have resulted in a special hearing under s 21 which could have resulted either in a verdict that the opponent was not guilty on the ground of mental illness (s 22(1)(b)), or a verdict that on the limited evidence available he committed the offence charged (s 22(1)(c)). 
    29    The trial Judge, in his reasons for determining not to conduct an enquiry but to dismiss the charge and order that the opponent be released, referred to the procedures under the Act, but did not refer to the procedures under Chapter 5 Part 2 of the Mental Health Act. These may not have been drawn to his attention. His reasons continued: 
     
      
       
       “That is a necessarily protracted procedure. However Parliament has seen fit to enact that that procedure should occur unless s 10(4) is applied and a court should not lightly say that simply for the purpose of ensuring that the time of the court and the executive be not taken up with proceedings which are not likely to produce any useful result then the court should simply interfere and put a stop to the proceedings. The sub section necessarily indicates that it is only in the interests of justice (as it affects the community in general and the accused and the particular member of the community affected, namely the victim which I think it is proper to consider) that the sub section ought to be applied … 
       
      
      
       
       Considering all the evidence, and taking account of the consequences, this is a case in which I feel that, because of the nature of the disability, I should order that the charge be dismissed …  
       
      
      
       
       If I were to have refused the application under sub section (4) then the matter would simply have gone through all the consequent extensive procedures that could possibly lead to the special hearing (in the nature of a trial) under s 18 of the Act, where there may be a verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness … 
       
      
      
       
       There is no provision in this part of the Act for provision to be made in respect of Mr Mills concerning his future welfare and the welfare of the community. That can only be done in the conjectural event that there is eventually a special verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness”. 
       
      
      
    30    In my judgment his Honour misdirected himself in three respects. He appears to have concluded that the procedures under the Act would not be likely “to produce any useful result”. A fuller examination of its provisions and the related provisions in Chapter 5 Pt 2 of the Mental Health Act 1990 demonstrates that those procedures could result in the opponent being detained following a verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness, or becoming the subject of a limiting term if the verdict was that on the limited evidence available he committed the offence. In the latter event he would remain in custody until his limiting term expired, or he was released following a determination by the Tribunal that his safety and that of the public would not be seriously endangered. 
    31    In these circumstances, with respect to the learned Judge, it cannot be said that the procedures were not likely to produce a useful result. 
    32    His Honour again fell into error when he said that: “Because of the nature of the disability, I should order that the charge be dismissed”. Section 10(4) does not authorise the summary termination of the proceedings simply because the Judge considers that they are inappropriate having regard to the nature of the person’s disability. The condition for the making of the order is that the Court forms a particular opinion which, so far as relevant, is that “it is inappropriate having regard to … the nature of the person’s disability … to inflict any punishment …”.  
    33    The Judge may have formed the required opinion but he nowhere states that he had done so, and it appears on the face of his reasons that he formed and acted on a different opinion which, on the terms of the statute, did not support his orders. Compare Public Service Association (SA) v Federated Clerks Union (1991) 173 CLR 132.  
    34    The final matter is that his Honour stated that provision for the future welfare of the opponent and the community could only be made “in the conjectural event that there is eventually a special verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness”. This statement, and his Honour’s references to the nature of the opponent’s disability, and the unlikelihood that he appreciated the nature and quality of his acts at the time, may indicate that his Honour had formed the opinion that a verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness would not be available because of the nature of the disability. However a verdict that on the limited evidence available the opponent committed the offence charged may have been open which would have authorised the imposition of a limiting term, making the opponent a forensic patient subject to the supervision of the Tribunal. 
    35    It may be that his Honour fell into no such error, but simply failed to refer to the possible verdict under s 22(1)(c) in the course of his extempore reasons. In a case such as this, the Court is bound to act on the reasons given, although they should be given a fair interpretation which makes allowance for their extempore expression and the pressures on trial Judges. However this generosity of approach does not enable this Court to infer that his Honour had additional reasons apart from those he expressed supplemented by any necessary implications therein. 
    36    Mr Craddock, who appeared for the opponent, advanced a new argument in this Court which, if accepted, may have provided a reason for the Court deciding, in its discretion, not to quash the orders of Moore DCJ. He submitted that the opponent’s disability, because of his intellectual impairment, made inevitable a finding that it was “inappropriate … to inflict any punishment on him” and that any loss of his liberty which the Act might authorise in his own interests, or in the interests of the community, was not punishment. 
    37    In some contexts this submission would have considerable force, but it has none in the context of this Act. Such a construction of s 10(4) would require the Court to dismiss the charge in almost every case where it concluded that the proper finding on the enquiry was that the person was not fit to be tried because of some condition which had existed at the time of the offence. 
    38    This submission also fails to give proper effect to the Act. Accepting, without deciding, that the detention required by s 39 for persons found not guilty on the ground of mental illness is not a punishment, the same cannot be said of the orders the Court is authorised to make if the verdict is that, on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed the offence charged. In that event s 23(1) requires the Court to nominate a limiting term being its best estimate of the sentence the court would have imposed if the special hearing had been a normal trial and the person had been found guilty. Section 23(2) provides that if the court would not have imposed a sentence of imprisonment or penal servitude, it may impose “any other penalty” lawfully available. Any such “penalty” is subject to appeal in the ordinary way (s 23(3)), and sub s (4) provides: 
     
      
       
       “In nominating a limiting term in respect of a person or imposing any other penalty or making any other order, the court may, if it thinks fit, take into account the periods, if any, of the person’s custody or detention before, during and after the special hearing (being periods relating to the offence)”. 
       
      
      
       
      
    39    It is clear from the use of the expression “any other penalty” in s 23(2), (3) and (4) that the nomination of a limiting term is treated as a penalty. If this were not so the phrase “any other penalty” in those provisions would have been quite inappropriate. This is supported by s 84(1)(a) of the Mental Health Act 1990, previously referred to, which enables the Attorney General to prevent the release of a forensic patient which would not seriously endanger his safety or that of any member of the public if he considers that he “has served insufficient time in custody or under detention”. This shows that a limiting term not only deprives the forensic patient of his liberty, but does so by way of punishment. The new argument raised by Mr Craddock in this Court must therefore be rejected. 
    40    The errors of law which I have identified appear on the face of the Judge’s reasons, and therefore on the face of the record. They also demonstrate that his Honour exceeded his authority and fell into jurisdictional error because he misconceived the nature of the function he was to perform. See Craig v The State of South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163, 177-8. 
    41    The Court should make the following orders: 
     
      
     (1) Order that the record of the proceedings in the District Court in its criminal jurisdiction in the case  
     Regina v John William Mills  
     99/21/3017 be removed into this Court; 
      
      
     (2) Quash the determination of his Honour Judge Moore of 1 May 2000 dismissing the charge against John William Mills and ordering that he be released; 
      
      
     (3) Direct that the proceedings be returned to the District Court in its criminal jurisdiction to be heard and determined according to law; 
      
      
     (4) No order as to costs. 
      
    42    SHELLER JA: I agree with Handley JA.******

     HEADNOTE 
     
     
     The appellant was convicted of murder and other offences and appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in not conducting a fitness inquiry pursuant to the  
     Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 
      (""the Act"") 
     . 
      
     Concern regarding the appellant's mental health was first raised by the Crown at a directions hearing, as a result of which the judge ordered a psychiatric examination and report. The appellant provided very little information to the psychiatrist. Upon tendering the psychiatric report the Crown Prosecutor stated that there was nothing before the Court to indicate that the accused was not fit to be tried. 
      
     The appellant insisted on appearing for himself at the trial. On the fourth day of the trial the Crown Prosecutor expressed concern regarding his fitness to stand trial, and the judge said he was satisfied that the issue of his fitness to be tried had been raised in good faith. Subsequently, the Crown Prosecutor purported to ""withdraw"" his earlier ""application"" and the trial continued.  
      
     Held: - 
       
      
     Once the issue of the appellant's fitness to be tried had been raised in good faith, it was not open to the Crown Prosecutor to  
     ""withdraw the application"",  
     and the trial judge had no alternative but to discharge the jury and order an inquiry to determine the appellant's fitness to be tried, as required by s 10 of the Act. His failure to do so resulted in a mis-trial.

    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL60091/99FOSTER AJADUNFORD JGREG JAMES J Thursday, 31 AUGUST 2000 
     
     R v Ju Sheng ZHANG 
      
     JUDGEMENT 
    1    FOSTER AJA: I agree with Dunford J. 
    2    DUNFORD J: This is an appeal by the appellant, Ju Sheng Zhang, against his conviction before Dowd J and a jury on one count of murder, one count of attempted murder, one count of use an offensive weapon with intent to prevent lawful apprehension and one count of malicious wounding, for all of which he was sentenced to effective terms of imprisonment totalling a minimum term of 19 years with an additional term of 5 years.  
    3    The Crown case was that the appellant was a tenant of premises at Fairfield of which the deceased, Guiseppe Arena, was the managing agent for the landlord. On 21 May 1997, the appellant attended the agency in order to pay his rent, which he did, and he then asked to speak to the deceased about his perceived difficulties with the replacement of locks consequent upon his advice to the agency that his premises had been broken into. A brief conversation followed which gave rise to an argument and the appellant produced a long bladed carving knife from a black bag he was carrying, whereupon the deceased ran into a rear office at the premises, chased by the appellant who was kicking at the door in order to gain entry.  
    4    In due course the appellant gained entry to the office area through a side door and charged at the deceased violently stabbing at him with the knife whilst two other employees, Stephen Jurinic and Fabio Lamalfa, attempted to disarm him and they were eventually able to get the appellant away from the deceased who was bleeding heavily. They assisted the deceased out of the office and down an alley way a short distance where he was subsequently treated by the ambulance crew. 
    5    The appellant remained in the office holding the knife whilst attempting to re-assure female staff that he would not harm them. When Mr Jurinic returned to the office the appellant, still wielding the knife, chased him out of the office and across the road. Meanwhile, a motorist observing the appellant's obvious intentions towards Mr Jurinic drove his car at the appellant and collided with him, causing him minimal injuries. The police arrived, but the appellant held them at bay with the knife, taunting them, saying, ""come on, come on, dead man, dead man, so what I mean is shoot me to death I'm a dead man"". Police eventually subdued the appellant but in the course of the struggle some of the officers including Senior Constable Russell were injured.  
    6    The appellant was interviewed by way of ERISP and offered an explanation for his actions, which explanation he expanded upon in his evidence. It was to the effect that his premises had been broken into at least twice and he did not consider that the agency had dealt with the problem adequately or appropriately. He also described at least two occasions when he had reported other unrelated incidents to police and police had not in his view responded in a manner which he considered appropriate. He said he knew his actions were wrong but he carried out his right to protect himself. 
    7    The only ground of appeal relied on was as follows: 
     
     The learned trial judge erred in not conducting a fitness inquiry. By reason of the failure to conduct a fitness inquiry the conviction is a miscarriage of justice. 
      
    8    The appellant was arrested on 21 May 1997 and remanded in custody where he has remained ever since. He was first seen by a lawyer when he appeared at the Local Court at Fairfield on 22 May 1997 and a solicitor with the Legal Aid Commission, took an application for legal aid from him. He also arranged for the appellant to be seen by Dr Bruce Westmore, a forensic psychiatrist, who saw him on 31 May 1997.  
    9    It appears from Dr Westmore's report of 3 June 1997 that the appellant was not co-operative in that interview and declined to discuss the case in any detail except to the extent of saying that he intended to plead guilty, and accordingly there was no need for the interview to proceed any further. He also indicated that he did not wish to have legal assistance but wished to speak to the judge himself. On the history obtained, Dr Westmore could not identify or exclude the presence or absence of mental illness, but said that although he did not appear to be depressed, there were other features of a bipolar affective disorder and suggested that he should be seen again by a psychiatrist when he was more amenable to such an assessment. 
    10    When the matter came back before the Local Court on 18 June 1997 the appellant informed the solicitor who was to appear for him that he wished to represent himself, and the proceedings were adjourned for a paper committal on 25 June 1997. He was not at any time thereafter represented by a lawyer until the hearing of the appeal. 
    11    He was committed for trial on 25 June 1997 and appeared in person at pre-trial mentions before Barr J on 2 February 1998, and on 20 April, 9 June and 16 July 1998 before Dowd J, the trial judge. 
    12    Concern relating to the appellant's mental health was first raised by the Crown at a directions hearing before Dowd J on 20 April 1998. After discussion, his Honour ordered a psychiatric report and requested that the accused undergo a psychiatric examination. He was therefore seen by Dr Andrew Walker on 5 June 1998. Once again the appellant provided very little information to the psychiatrist. He declined to give any answers as to whom he had killed or why, except that he had a good reason, and that he recognised that the offence that he had committed was regarded as wrong. He refused to give any detailed information concerning his personal history. Dr Walker reported that there was no evidence of cognitive defect and his short term memory was satisfactory, but that he refused further formal cognitive examination, that no psychiatric disorder was elicited and there was no evidence of brain dysfunction, although it was not impossible that he might be suffering from a psychiatric condition such as delusional (paranoid) disorder which it would be possible to conceal under interview conditions, and that he was able to judge right and wrong.  
    13    When the matter came on again on 9 June 1998 the Crown tendered the psychiatric report (the transcript notes the report being dated ""15"" June 1998 but that apparently should read ""5"" June 1998 according to Annexure ""E"" to Mr Barrow's affidavit). The appellant made some submissions about the report which was admitted into evidence. The Crown Prosecutor said that ""it would seem, despite the limitations of the report, that there is nothing before this court to indicate that the accused is not fit to stand trial"". 
    14    When the matter came on for trial on 20 July 1998, the appellant insisted on appearing for himself. He asserted that he had killed the deceased but that it was not ""wrong"" to do so. He said that because he knew that he did it and the matter had been fully explored in the Local Court it was not necessary that it be examined once more, and his Honour appeared unable to bring the appellant to an understanding that the Local Court was not a final procedure and that the jury had the responsibility to determine guilt. 
    15    He appeared not to understand the necessity for him to plead to the charges and asserted that he had no interest in what the witnesses would say, not so much because they were unlikely to be truthful or reliable, but because they were irrelevant to the procedure as he perceived it to be. Upon arraignment on the first (murder) count he said, ""whether it is guilty or not guilty, the issue of the plea is not in existence. I have already stated yesterday, I only want to tell the court what I did and my attitude toward it."" His Honour directed that a plea of not guilty be entered on behalf of the accused. A similar response occurred when arraigned on each of the remaining counts.  
    16    As the trial progressed the appellant began to question his Honour's conduct of the trial, constantly repeating that the matter had been dealt with in the Local Court and accordingly there was no need for any further proceedings in the Supreme Court. He questioned why jurors without legal knowledge should be involved and declined to cross-examine any of the witnesses, maintaining that he was not interested in anything they said. After a number of witnesses had given evidence, the appellant sought that his Honour disqualify himself for bias, the ostensible reason being that the trial judge was insisting on the calling of evidence in circumstances that the appellant considered unnecessary. 
    17    On the morning of the fourth day of the trial, 23 July 1998, before the jury came into court the Crown Prosecutor said he wished to raise a matter in relation to the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 and referred his Honour in particular to s 9 of that Act and the decision of the High Court in Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230 and to R v Presser [1958] VR 45.  
    18    The Crown Prosecutor said, inter alia,  
     
      
       
       ""It is of concern to me, and that is why I make the submission, that the accused by what he stated yesterday has indicated to the court, that apart from what he stated on previous occasions, he does not want to participate in these proceedings. But yesterday particularly he was indicating to the court through what he was saying that he does have . . . some problem in understanding what is going on, and his statements concerning the way the case has been conducted by the Crown indicates that he has little understanding, . . . of what is occurring."" 
       
      
      
     The Crown Prosecutor also referred to the behaviour of the appellant in court and suggested that, whether it was feigned or not, by such behaviour and by his comments, he was indicating that he was having some difficulty in coping with evidence as it was being given and continued: 
      
       
       ""With great respect he is not behaving in a rational fashion. In my submission there is a real question here about whether the trial should continue."" 
       
      
      
    19    He then tendered a further report which had been obtained from Dr Walker dated 19 July, such report being supplementary to the earlier report of 5 June and based solely on the doctor's interview with the appellant on the earlier date. The report was directed primarily to whether there was available to the appellant a defence of mental illness within the M'Naghten rules. Dr Walker could detect no evidence of psychosis and considered that from what little evidence there was available to him, the appellant did not suffer from a delusional disorder, and as I read his report, concluded that he did not come within the M'Naghten definition of mental illness although the wording is not very clear.  
    20    His Honour observed, incorrectly, that ""the issue of fitness was determined before the trial"". There had in fact been no fitness hearing, Dr Walker had, as noted above, merely reported upon the appellant after the Director of Public Prosecutions expressed concern as to fitness, but had offered no opinion as to fitness and the subject matter was never the subject of a hearing.  
    21    His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
       ""There is nothing that I have observed that warrants a determination on fitness. If you propose to raise the matter of fitness before the court, have you considered the procedure advised by the  
       Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 
       ?"" 
       
      
      
     His Honour indicated his view that the trial could not continue after the raising of the issue and observed that he regarded the issue as  
     ""raised in good faith"". 
      He said that such being the case the Crown's application would result in the trial being aborted and a fresh jury would need to be empanelled to try the issue of fitness to be tried. After further discussion the Crown Prosecutor sought an adjournment so that he could speak to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The adjournment was granted.  
      
    22    On resumption he announced that he had spoken to the Director's office and that he withdrew the application, and in response to a question from his Honour said that he no longer wished to raise the issue of the appellant's unfitness to be tried. The trial continued. The appellant's active involvement at the trial did not improve, although he gave evidence, but did not make a final address to the jury. He continued to voice his opinion monotonously that the proceedings were unnecessary in view of what had occurred in the Local Court and continued to claim that what he had done was not wrong and that both he and the deceased were victims of society.  
    23    Criminal proceedings relating to persons affected by mental disorders is dealt with by Part 2 (ss 4 - 30), Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (""the Act""). The question of a person's unfitness to be tried may be raised by any party to the proceedings or by the Court (s 5), and the issue is to be determined on the balance of probabilities (s 6). Section 7 provides that the question of a person's unfitness is so far as practicable to be raised before the person is arraigned, but may be raised at any time during the course of the hearing and may be raised on more than one occasion in respect of the same proceedings. Section 8 provides that where unfitness is raised before arraignment, the Attorney General must determine whether an inquiry should be conducted before the hearing, and that he may at any time before the inquiry is commenced determine there is no longer any need for such inquiry, whilst s 9 requires that where unfitness is raised after arraignment the court must hear any submissions relating to the inquiry in the absence of the jury. Section 10 is as follows: 
     
      
       
       (1) If, in respect of an offence: 
        
         
         (a) the Attorney General determines that an inquiry should be conducted and does not subsequently determine, before the inquiry is commenced, that there is no longer any need for such an inquiry to be conducted; or 
          
         (b) the question of a person's unfitness to be tried for the offence is raised after the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence, 
          
         the Court must (except as provided by this section), as soon as practicable after the Attorney General's determination is made or the question is raised, as the case may be, conduct an inquiry in order to determine whether the person is unfit to be tried for the offence. 
         
        
        
       (2) The Court must not conduct an inquiry into the question of a person's unfitness to be tried for an offence unless it appears to the Court that the question has been raised in good faith. 
        
        
       (3) Before conducting an inquiry, the Court may do any one or more of the following: 
        
         
         (a) adjourn the proceedings; 
          
         (b) grant the accused person bail in accordance with the  
         Bail Act 1978 
         ; 
          
         (c) remand the accused person in custody for a period not exceeding 28 days; 
          
         (d) request the accused person to undergo a psychiatric examination or other examination; 
          
         (e) request that a psychiatric report or other report relating to the accused person be obtained; 
          
         (f) discharge any jury constituted for the purpose of those proceedings; 
          
         (g) make any other order that the Court considers appropriate. 
         
        
        
       (4) If, in respect of a person charged with an offence, the Court is of the opinion that it is inappropriate, having regard to the trivial nature of the charge or offence, the nature of the person's disability or any other matter which the Court thinks proper to consider, to inflict any punishment, the Court may determine not to conduct an inquiry and may dismiss the charge and order that the person be released. 
       
      
    24    The issue of unfitness is to be determined by a jury constituted for that purpose (s 11) unless the person, having sought and received legal advice, elects to have the issue determined by a judge alone (s 11A). Section 12 deals with the conduct of the inquiry and ss 13 to 30 with the procedures that are to be followed if the person is found unfit to be tried.  
    25    In my view the provisions of s 10 are explicit and mandatory. If the question of a person's unfitness to be tried is raised after the person has been arraigned, the Court must, as soon as practicable after the question is raised, conduct an inquiry in order to determine whether such person is unfit to be tried. There are only two exceptions provided for, one is provided by subs (2) namely that it appears to the court that the question has not been raised in good faith, and the other is provided by subs (4) where the charge or offence is of a trivial nature, and need not be further considered in the present context.  
    26    In the present case his Honour expressly found that the question had been raised in good faith, and consequently there was no alternative, even though it may have been inconvenient, but to discharge the existing jury and conduct the inquiry required by s 10(1) before a different jury (s 11). As the appellant was refusing to seek or receive legal advice, no question arose of an election under s 11A for the inquiry to be conducted by a judge alone.  
    27    There can be no doubt that the question was raised by the Crown Prosecutor first thing on the morning of 23 April and, as I have already noted, his Honour agreed that the question had been raised in good faith. The issue having been raised, it was not open to the Crown Prosecutor to ""withdraw the application"" as he purported to do, because he had not made any application so there was nothing to withdraw, and in any event, once he raised the question, the consequences followed inevitably.  
    28    It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that before s 10 came into operation the trial judge had to be satisfied that there was a real and substantial question to be considered in relation to the accused's fitness to be tried, and reference was made to R v Presser at 46, Kesavarajah v The Queen at 245 and Eastman v The Queen [2000] HCA 29, 74 ALJR 915, at paras [28], [66], [319]. However, those cases related to the procedure under the relevant Victorian and Australian Capital Territory legislation respectively, both of which were in significantly different terms to s 10.  
    29    Counsel for the Crown expressed concern that there was a need for a further threshold test in addition to the raised in good faith test provided by subs (2), because the question could be raised in good faith but inappropriately, for example by an over anxious party. Not only do I consider such an occurrence most unlikely but, whatever the position may be at common law and in other states, s 10 admits of no other threshold test. Of course if the judge considered that the question was raised merely for tactical reasons, he or she would not find that it was raised in good faith. No question of that nature arises in this case. The mere fact that the appellant kept asserting that there was no need for a trial because it had all been resolved in the Local Court itself raised the issue of whether he understood the nature of the proceedings. 
    30    For these reasons, I am satisfied that the question of the accused's fitness to be tried having been raised at the beginning of proceedings on 23 July, his Honour had no alternative but to discharge the jury and order an inquiry in accordance with s 10, and his failure to do so resulted in a mis-trial. As Gaudron J said in Eastman at [62]: 
     
      
       
       ""The consequence of an error as to whether the accused is fit to be tried is 'a fundamental flaw in the trial process.'"" 
       
      
      
    31    It follows that the conviction must be set aside and a new trial ordered, but the consequence of ordering a new trial is that the question has now been raised ""before the person is arraigned"", and consequently it is up to the Attorney General to determine whether an inquiry should be conducted before the re-trial (s 8). 
    32    It is also arguable that in the present case the question of fitness to be tried arose before arraignment at the directions hearing on 20 April 1998, but in view of my conclusions in relation to what happened on 23 July 1999 it is not necessary to consider this aspect of the matter any further.  
    33    I therefore propose the following orders.  
     
     1. Appeal allowed. 
      
     2. Convictions and sentences quashed. 
      
     3. New trial ordered. 
      
      
     4. Note that the question of the appellant's unfitness to be tried has been raised before his arraignment on the new trial and accordingly s 8,  
     Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 
      applies. 
      
    34    GREG JAMES J: I agree with Dunford J.

    The respondent pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery whilst armed, two counts of robbery in company, and three counts of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. In addition, there were eleven offences included in the Form 1, which included six separate and unrelated robberies. The DPP appealed under s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the inadequacy of sentence imposed on grounds that (1) the sentencing judge did not give sufficient weight to the offences included in the Form 1, (2) in relation to any particular count, the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate, and (3) there was manifest leniency in the way in which the sentencing order was framed by way of concurrent sentences.HELD:1. Where a Form 1 includes serious offences they should not simply be noted, but must be taken into account when the sentence is imposed. Even if the Form 1 offences were applied distributively among the three s97(2) offences, the criminality of the respondent’s conduct was not given its proper weight.Morgan (1993) 70 ACrimR 368 2. In determining the appropriate sentence, the number of offences and their individual seriousness, judged objectively and by reference to the penalties specified by the legislature, must be taken into account. In imposing the sentence, the judge is permitted to consider all of the conduct of the defendant including conduct which aggravates the offence, on the proviso that the defendant is not sentenced for a more serious offence than that with which he or she is charged.Di Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 and Malone [2000] NSWCCA 156 applied 3. The sentencing judge did not have due regard to the warning given in Broxam and the stern approach taken by the NSWCCA when sentencing offenders charged with serious premeditated offences of robbery and armed robbery.Bishell NSWCCA 18 February 1993; McKinnon NSWCCA 10 April 1991; Bell NSWCCA 11 May 1993; Begnell NSWCCA 26 November 1992; Mathews NSWCCA 11 June 1992; Mutton NSWCCA 18 October 1991; Gardener NSWCCA 12 April 1994; Jarrott NSWCCA 30 November 1993; Mackenroth NSWCCA 3 March 1994; and Moran NSWCCA 30 November 1994 considered.4. Although the sentencing judge acted in accordance with the correct sentencing principles, when the seriousness of the offences, the aggravating circumstances, the accelerating criminality of the respondent and the inconsistencies between the sentences imposed for different offences were properly taken into account, the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate.Everett v The Queen (1994) 124 ALR 529, Readman (1990) 47 ACrimR 181, Kenny Li (1997) NSWCCA 9 July 1997, Henry and Ors applied6. The sentencing judge also failed to strike the proper balance between the sentences to be imposed for the individual counts and the principle of totality. The imposition of a concurrent service of sentence did not reflect the level of criminality involved and significant error of law was made.Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34; Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610, Mill (1988) 166 CLR 59 applied.7. Having regard to the principle of double jeopardy, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the guideline judgment of Thompson and Houlton, and the considerations outlined in Kalache, new sentences in lieu of those at first instance were imposed. No significant factors existed to afford the offender leniency in sentence. Mark Anthony Rose NSWCCA 23 May 1996, Allpass (1994) 73 ACrimR, Osenkowski (1982) 20 SASR 212; Bell NSWCCA 11 May 1993; Dwight NSWCCA 14 April 2000, Thompson and Houlton applied.

     THURSDAY 31 AUGUST 2000 
     
     
     
     Regina v Lorima BAVADRA 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
    1   BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Wood CJ at CL.2   WOOD CJ at CL: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions under S5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, against the inadequacy of sentences imposed by her Honour Judge English, at the Liverpool District Court on 12 November 1999. 
    3   On 20 May 1999, the respondent entered pleas of guilty to two counts of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, to two counts of robbery in company, and to three counts of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. Eleven matters on a Form 1 were taken into account by the Court, when dealing with the three last mentioned offences , although it was not specified in relation to which count this was done. 
    4   The maximum penalty for the offence of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon is 25 years imprisonment (Crimes Act 1900 S 97(2)). The remaining offences of robbery in company, and robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, are punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment (Crimes Act 1900, S 97(1)).  
    5   In relation to count 7, being the last in point of time, which charged an offence of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, the respondent was sentenced to a minimum term of six years penal servitude to commence from 31 July 1998 with an additional term of four years to commence on 31 July 2004. 
    6   In relation to the other two counts (ie counts 3 and 5) involving this offence, the respondent was sentenced to fixed terms of five years and six years respectively, to be served concurrently with the sentence for Count 7. The two counts of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon (counts 1 and 6) were dealt with by way of fixed terms of penal servitude for four years, to be served concurrently with the other sentences. The remaining counts of robbery in company (counts 2 and 4) led to fixed terms of three years penal servitude, similarly to be served concurrently with the remaining sentences. 
    7   The criminality of the respondent covered by the counts in the indictment to which he pleaded guilty, spanned the period between 6 October 1997 and 11 May 1998. It involved sustained unlawfulness of a most serious kind, comprising so far as the offences of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon were concerned: 
     
      
     (a) the use of a handgun on 17 November 1997, to rob $33,391 in cash from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia at Toongabbie. This offence was committed by the respondent in conjunction with four other offenders. In the course of its commission bank staff were threatened with a Stanley knife and a handgun, and forced to lie on the floor. The respondent was identified from stills taken from the security cameras in the bank, and also by bank employees at an identification parade. He made a handwritten confession to this offence. (count 3) 
      
      
     (b) the use of a handgun on 24 February 1998, to rob a quantity of cigarettes, and $550 cash from a Seven Eleven convenience store at Merrylands. The respondent was, on this occasion, accompanied by three other men. He produced a handgun which he held to the head of the victim, who was forced to walk to the rear of the premises, where his face was covered. While there he was stabbed to the hand and leg by one of the co-offenders. The respondent was identified from video stills. (count 5) 
      
      
     (c) the use of a shortened double barrelled shot gun, on 11 May 1998, to rob $2000 in cash and a quantity of alcohol, from the Metropolitan Bottlemart at Cremorne. The respondent was accompanied by one other offender, who carried a sports bag into the premises. From it the respondent withdrew a shotgun which he pointed at an attendant who was instructed to open the till. This employee and a customer were taken to a storage room where they were made to lie on the ground. The respondent was identified from video stills. When he was arrested he made admissions as to his involvement. The shotgun, which was recovered near the scene, was found to be loaded with two cartridges. (count 7) 
      
    8   The offences of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon involved: 
     
      
     (a) the use of a knife, on 6 October 1997, to rob $500 in cash and cigarettes from a Liquorland store at Auburn. In the course of this offence, the respondent held a knife to the neck of an employee of the store. His face was clearly visible in a video still recorded by a security camera. (count 1) 
      
      
     ( b) the use of a meat cleaver, on 25 February 1998, to rob $16,195 cash from the Commonwealth Trading Bank at Riverstone. This offence was committed in the company of four other offenders at least one of whom produced a knife when jumping onto the bank counter. Staff and customers were ordered to lie on the ground. One of the offenders patrolled the area with a meat cleaver, while cash was gathered from the tellers’ cash drawers. The respondent was identified from security stills and also by bank staff at an identification parade. (count 6) 
      
    9   The offences of robbery in company involved: 
     
      
     (a) the robbery of 35 Sony CD games worth $3,500 and $300 in cash from a Civic Video Store at Wollongong on 4 November 1997. This offence was committed in the company of at least three other males, one of whom pointed a shotgun at an employee, whose hands were then bound by electrical tape while a search was made for the safe and the video games. The respondent was identified by the victim from a photograph board. (count 2) 
      
      
     ( b) the robbery of $450 in cash and 567 instant lottery tickets to the value of $2,000 from the Penrith East Newsagency, on 10 January 1998. This offence was committed by the respondent in company with one other male. The respondent, carrying a knife, came to the aid of the co-offender, when one of the proprietors of the store threw a paper weight at him, and when her husband, armed with a broom, demanded that he leave. He shoulder-charged the male proprietor to the ground, and ordered him and his wife to go to the back of the shop and open the safe. The respondent was disguised with a monster mask, while the co-offender was wearing a balaclava. (count 4) 
      
    10   The offences taken into account on a Form 1, were in four instances, related to counts in the indictment (ie counts 2, 4, 5 and 6). They comprised one offence of robbery in company, one of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, one of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, and one of being carried in a conveyance without the consent of the owner. The robberies, in each case, related to the theft of wallets of staff at the stores or the bank from which cash or goods were stolen, while the last offence related to the use of a vehicle stolen for the purpose of the principal offence. 
    11   The remainder of the offences on the Form 1 involved matters comprising, in brief summary, four offences of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon, in each case a knife, committed variously at the Liberty Service Station at St Mary’s, at the Red Rooster Store at Merrylands, and at the ANZ Bank in Penrith. Additionally, they involved two offences of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, in each case a handgun, committed at the Red Rooster Store at Guildford, and at the Pizza Hut at Merrylands, and one count of assault police officer with intent to resist lawful apprehension. In three of these instances the respondent acted alone, and in the remaining cases he had a co-offender. Their inclusion in the sentencing proceedings expanded the period of criminality covered to 30 July 1998, four of the offences having occurred after the last offence in the indictment. 
    12   Subjectively, it may be noted that the respondent was of Fijian descent, was the second eldest of a family of five, was aged twenty-one years at the time of the offences, and had a history of offending from the age of sixteen years and of detention pursuant to control orders in Boys Homes arising from those offences. He also had a history of alcohol and drug abuse. He had some brief employment as a factory hand and builders labourer. 
    13   Material placed before her Honour, it was accepted suggested that the respondent had not adjusted well upon the arrival of his family in this country, that he had fallen in with a group which had a negative influence upon him, and that this had led to conflicts with his father. While noting that he enjoyed the support of his mother, sister and girlfriend, and that he had used his last period of detention to complete his education to School Certificate level and to undertake a fine arts course at TAFE, English DCJ expressed some doubt as to whether he was truly remorseful or contrite about his conduct, or was instead more concerned about the impact of the sentence upon himself and upon his relationship with his child. 
    14   The conclusion was reached by her Honour that the main reason for the respondent’s involvement in the offences was a desire to belong, or as it was otherwise put, peer group pressure. A lesser consideration was the need to obtain funds to purchase drugs, a matter which her Honour appropriately noted was not a mitigating factor in this instance. 
    15   In sentencing the respondent, the learned sentencing Judge meticulously examined the facts, in respect of which, save for one matter, (para 15 below) her findings were not challenged. She also had regard to the sentences imposed upon the various co-offenders, but appropriately noted that little was served by way of comparison, since the overall criminality of the respondent significantly exceeded that of the co-offenders, whose crimes were less in number.  
    16   In relation to count 3, the respondent was given some credit for his plea of guilty since her Honour stated that a conviction against him would not inevitably have been found absent specific evidence, or an admission, that he was personally armed with the gun or knives which were used in the offence. In my view this was incorrect, as the Crown contended, in view of the concept of joint criminal enterprise. For the remaining counts, her Honour found that convictions would have been “highly likely”, irrespective of the plea. That finding was manifestly correct. 
    17   The learned sentencing Judge noted appropriately that “people who are legitimately entitled to go about their business deserve to be protected from knife wielding, gun toting thugs”. The description of the respondent as such an offender was accurate, since his conduct involved a period of sustained and serious unlawfulness in which the safety of very many innocent persons was threatened. Only one victim impact statement was tendered, but there was other material before the Court, the effect of which could hardly be gainsaid, that those present at the scene of each offence could not have been otherwise than genuinely terrified and fearful for their lives. 
    18   Her Honour did not fall into error in noting that the community regards with abhorrence the use of guns and knives to commit criminal offences, a matter reflected by the severity of the maximum penalties prescribed for the offences before the Court. The need for both general and specific deterrence in the framing of sentences for such offences, is manifest, a matter to which her Honour again made reference, being a matter firmly established upon the authorities: See for example: Manh Hung Vu NSWCCA 11 November 1993; Samuela Antonio [2000[ NSWCCA 266 and Henry & Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. 
    19   The interests of rehabilitation of the respondent, as a relatively young offender, were expressly taken into account and a longer period than usual was provided by way of an additional term to allow for an extended period of supervision. 
    20   English DCJ, also made it clear that the principle of totality was not overlooked, expressly noting that the sentencing task was to be undertaken in accordance with the dictates of Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610. Her task, as she saw it, was to determine the appropriate sentence for each offence and then to deal with matters of concurrence or accumulation, having regard to the totality principle. 
    21   It was submitted by the Director of Public Prosecutions that the sentences imposed failed adequately to reflect the total criminality of the respondent’s conduct in committing the seven robberies included in the indictment, taking into account the eleven offences in the Form 1, which included six separate and unrelated robberies. 
    22   I am satisfied, from the matters outlined, that her Honour did not overlook in her statement of reasons for sentence any relevant sentencing principle in dealing with the respondent. The questions that arise seem to me to relate to whether or not: 
     
      
     (a) sufficient weight was given to the matters included in the Form 1; 
      
      
     (b) in relation to any particular count, the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate, and/or 
      
      
     (c) in the way in which the sentencing order was framed, by way of concurrent sentences, there was a manifest leniency. 
      
    23   If any of these questions is answered in the affirmative, then further questions arise as to whether the inadequacy is of such a degree as to constitute an error of law, since more is required than an assessment that, if the Court had been sentencing the offender, it might have imposed a different sentence: Skinner (1913) 16 CLR 336; and as to whether in the exercise of its discretion, the Court should disallow the appeal. 
     
      
     Form 1 Offences 
      
    24   Although it does not expressly appear in respect of which of the three counts involving the offence of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, the Form 1 matters were taken into account, it would seem likely that it was count 7. That was the count which attracted the longest sentence, it had an additional term attached to it, and it was the one which her Honour said “warranted the most severe penalty”. Moreover, it was the last offence in point of time, having followed a period of sustained and accelerating criminality, and it was one in which the prosecution was able to establish that the shotgun presented by the accused was loaded with a cartridge in each chamber.  
    25   It was submitted that, in the way that the sentences were structured, and in all the circumstances of the case, insufficient weight must have been given to the offences in the Form 1. A convenient starting point for this submission involves an examination of the sentences imposed in respect of counts 3 and 7. 
    26   The offence in count 3, attracted a number of circumstances of aggravation, including the fact that it involved a bank at which tellers and customers were physically threatened, not just by the presence of weapons but by words and acts designed to convey that those weapons would be used to overcome any resistance. The offence was further aggravated by the circumstances that the weapons in question included knives and a handgun, that five men were involved who were clearly acting in concert and in a premeditated way, and that a substantial sum of money was stolen. In the course of the offence a handgun was held some 15 cms. from the face of one victim, and a knife was held to the neck of another victim as he lay on the floor. 
    27   A five year fixed term for this offence standing alone, does not to my mind reflect the objective criminality involved, when the offence is considered in the light of the guideline judgment in Henry & Ors, the present being a case involving a considerably greater degree of criminality than was postulated in that decision, (at 162). It is also not easy to reconcile the fact that the sentence imposed for this offence was less than that imposed in respect of count 5, particularly if any allowance was made for the Form 1 matters when dealing with it. 
    28   The sentence in respect of count 7, similarly appears to me to be appellably lenient, even standing alone, when considered in the light of the accelerating criminality of the respondent, and in the light of the facts that yet again the respondent was acting in company, that a customer and staff member were threatened, and that the sawn off shotgun used in the offence was found be loaded with a cartridge in each chamber. The latter was a significant circumstance of aggravation: Readman (1990) 47 A Crim R 181 at 185; as was the fact that the offence was carried out in company: Kenny Li (1997) NSWCCA 9 July 1997. 
    29   I have reached the conclusion that the starting point for counts 3 and 7 was too low, and that even if the offences in the Form 1 were applied distributively among the three S97(2) offences, their objective criminality could not have been given their proper weight. Even more apparent is that the case if they were taken into account for either count 3, 5 or 7 alone. 
    30   When serious offences are included in a Form 1, the sentence imposed, in respect of the count for which they are taken into account, must reflect the totality of the criminal involvement. It is not the case that Form 1 offences need only be noted in passing, or that little by way of additional penalty should be imposed by reason of their existence: Morgan (1993) 70 ACrimR 368 at 372 per Hunt CJ at CL.  
    31   There is a considerable advantage to the administration of justice, and to accused persons, for a party facing sentence to clean up the record. For that purpose the Form 1 procedure is beneficial. The objective of individual rehabilitation can be advanced by its use, since the offender does not face the prospect of further trials. There is a utilitarian value in the admission of guilt that is involved so far as there can be a saving of the resources of the law enforcement agencies and the courts concerned. Additionally, the sentencing judge is placed in a position where it is possible to sentence the offender for the totality of his or her outstanding criminality to that point. However, unless proper weight is given to the additional offences that have been disclosed, this procedure fails its true purpose.  
    32   Unfortunately it appears to me that this is precisely what happened in the present case, as can be seen from a review of the offences included in the indictment and the Form 1, with which the court was concerned, and the degree of seriousness reflected by the penalties prescribed by the legislature in relation to them. 
    33   The maximum available penalties of imprisonment for the offences included in the indictment were as follows: 
     
      
       
       count 1 S97(1) 20 years 
        
        
        2 S97(1) 20 
        
        
        3 S97(2) 25 
        
        
        4 S97(1) 20 
        
        
        5 S97(2) 25 
        
        
        6 S97(1) 20 
        
        
        7 S97(2)  
       25 
       
      
      
      155 years 
      
      
     Those for the offences included in the Form 1 were as follows: 
      
      
       
        1 S97(1) 20 years 
       
      
      
       
        2 S97(1) 20 
       
      
      
       
        3 S97(2) 25 
       
      
      
       
        4 S154A(1) 5 
       
      
      
       
        5 S97(1) 20 
       
      
      
       
        6 SS97(1) 20 
       
      
      
       
        7 S97(1) 20 
       
      
      
       
        8 S97(1) 20 
       
      
      
       
        9 S58 5 
       
      
      
       
        10 S97(2) 25 
       
      
      
       
        11 S97(2)  
       25 
       
      
      
       
        205 years 
       
      
    34   It would be totally inappropriate to approach the sentencing exercise solely by a comparison of the sentences imposed against the available maximum sentences for all offences, that needed to be taken into account upon the indictment and Form 1. That would risk the imposition of a wholly disproportionate sentence. The number of offences and their individual seriousness, judged objectively and by reference to the penalties specified by the legislature, must however, be kept in mind. In the circumstances outlined, only one conclusion is open - namely that insufficient weight was given to the matters included in the Form 1, when the total criminality of the respondent was measured. This ground of appeal had been made good. 
     
      
     Individual Counts 
      
    35   I am also of the view that there was a manifest inadequacy of the sentences imposed for counts 2 and 4, each of which involved circumstances of significant aggravation. In the case of count 2, these involved the threatening use of a shotgun, the tying up of the victim, and the participation of at least four offenders. In the case of Count 4, one of the victims was injured when shoulder-charged to the floor after offering resistance. As was made clear in Malone [2000] NSWCCA 156, it remains permissible for a Judge to consider all the conduct of the defendant, including that which would aggravate the offence, without infringing the principle in Di Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383, subject to the important proviso that the offender is sentenced for the offence with which he or she is charged and not for a more serious offence which those circumstances might have attracted: (see also: (see also Ryan [2000] NSWCCA 98. 
    36   In the case of count 6, there were also circumstances of serious aggravation in that bank tellers and staff were threatened by the respondent and by his four co-offenders, a variety of weapons were used including a meat cleaver, and a large sum of money was stolen. It was significantly more serious than the offence involved in count 1, and it involved an accumulation of criminal conduct, yet it attracted the same penalty. A somewhat longer sentence should have been imposed, in my view.  
    37   Having regard to the individual seriousness of the offences charged in these counts, the accelerating outbreak of unlawfulness on the part of the respondent, and the inconsistencies in sentence identified, I am of the view that although her Honour directed herself in accordance with the correct sentencing principles, she fell into error of law in undervaluing the degree of criminality displayed, and in then imposing sentences that were way too lenient: Everett v The Queen (1994) 124 ALR 529 at 532. 
    38   In the approach taken by her Honour to the entire case, insufficient regard seems to have been given to the stern approach favoured by this court in relation to serious premeditated offences of robbery in company and armed robbery, or to the sentencing pattern for such offences reflected in decisions such as Bishell NSWCCA 18 February 1992; McKinnon NSWCCA 10 April 1991, Bell NSWCCA 11 May 1993; Begnell NSWCCA 26 November 1992;  Mathews NSWCCA 11 June 1992; Mutton NSWCCA 18 October 1991; Gardner NSWCCA 12 April 1994; Jarrott NSWCCA 27 September 1993; Mackenroth NSWCCA 3 March 1994 and Moran NSWCCA 30 November 1994, even after due allowance is made for the circumstance that, in a number of these cases, the offender was a long term recidivist. 
    39   What is important is that these decisions reflect the strong warning, given as long ago as 1986, in Broxam NSWCCA 3 April 1986: 
     
      
       
       “The prevalence of the offence in respect of which the applicant was sentenced is a matter of grave social concern … It is now well recognised that the victims of such armed robberies or attempted armed robberies may suffer devastating psychological damage consequent upon the trauma necessarily involved with the commission of such offences. In these circumstances sentencing judges will be recreant to the trust which the community places in them, were they not to impose sentences consistent with the seriousness and prevalence of such offences.” 
       
      
    40   In coming to the conclusion that this further ground has been made out, I have had regard to the interests of the rehabilitation of the applicant as a relatively young offender, and have also given due weight to the purely utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty which in this case would properly attract a discount in the order of 15%: Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309. The present is however, a case in which his conviction was inevitable, and his remorse, as her Honour found, was qualified. The concept advanced on his behalf that he reflected upon, or realised the seriousness of his conduct, only when he was arrested, is impossible to accept and the attribution of his criminality to a desire to be accepted by his peers, bears, to my mind, no weight as a mitigating factor. 
     
      
     Sentences made concurrent 
      
    41   It was next submitted that her Honour should have directed some accumulation of sentence, in order to strike a proper balance between the principle of totality, and the sentences to be imposed for the individual counts. This submission has, in my view, also been made good. 
    42   The observations of Sully J in Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34 at [34] are particularly appropriate for the present case: 
     
      
       
       “34. The correct application to such a case as the present one of the principles established by the decision in  
       Pearce 
        is not by any means a simple matter. Two things not necessarily reconcilable, if indeed reconcilable at all, have to be held in a fair overall balance. 
       
      
      
       
       35. One of them is the consideration conventionally referred to in the Courts as the principle of totality. That is to say, the principle that accepts the need, in a case of multiple offences, to adopt an approach which is more discriminating than the approach of simply fixing individual sentences, and then simply aggregating the individual sentences so as to reach a result, which such a process almost inevitably produces, of a truly enormous head sentence. 
       
      
      
       
       36. The countervailing factor, no less legitimate, is the need to ensure public confidence in the administration of criminal justice; and, in particular, to ensure that there does not emerge in the community at large a perception that there is not all that much to choose between the person who commits one or two offences, and the person who commits six or seven offences, for the reason that somehow or other they all manage to finish up with effective sentences between or among which there is hardly anything in practical terms to choose. 
       
      
      
       
       37. It needs to be clearly understood by all concerned that a person who commits a deliberate series of discrete offences, - and the present applicant’s case, is a good example of the kind - he must not be left with the idea that by intoning references to the principle of totality as though it were some magic mantra, he can escape effective punishment for the offences which follow successively one upon another throughout the whole course of a studied and deliberate course of criminal behaviour.” 
       
      
    43   A total sentencing order involving a minimum term of six years and an additional term of four years could not reflect the total criminality here involved, and her Honour’s decision that the concurrent service of the sentences imposed would reflect the principle of totality, failed, in my view, to pay proper regard to Mill (1988) 166 CLR 59 and to Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610. Error in law of a material kind has been established. 
     
      
     The Proper Sentence 
      
    44   The present case is, in my view, one where the overall sentencing order falls so far short of that which would reflect the totality of the respondent’s criminality, that material error in point of principle has been established, as that expression was explained by Sheller JA in Bragias (1997) 92 ACrimR 330 at 331: See also Allpass (1994) 73 A Crim R 561 at 562-563,  Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2; Hughesman NSW CA 5 April 1995, and Everett (1994) 181 CLR 295, as to the considerations that apply in relation to Crown appeals against sentence.  
    45   The present is not a case that should attract an exercise of the well known general discretion in relation to Crown appeals; nor is it one where there has been delay by the Crown in instituting the appeal, of the kind or degree that might, on that ground, cause this Court to not interfere with the sentences that were imposed. In this regard, it may be noted that the respondent was informed by letter, on 2 December 1999, of the circumstance that the Director of Public Prosecutions was considering an appeal. The notice of appeal was signed on 23 December 1999, and served on the respondent on 30 December 1999. Thereafter, the appeal was prosecuted with due diligence, and it was only because of the volume of work in the Court of Criminal Appeal that it came not to be heard until 7 August 2000. There was no real occasion for its expedition given the length of the sentences imposed and the absence of any application by the respondent to appeal against their severity. No prejudice was caused. 
    46   However, the principle of double jeopardy does permit some reduction of the sentences that would, to my mind, have properly been imposed at first instance. What is now required is the least sentence that could properly have been imposed at that time: Mark Anthony Rose NSWCCA 23 May 1996 per Gleeson CJ at 3, and Allpass. 
    47   Upon the basis that this Court should intervene, it is necessary to resentence the applicant in accordance with the new sentencing regime laid down by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: Carrion [2000] NSWCCA 191, in the light of his present circumstances and by reference to the relevant considerations identified in Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2. 
     
      
    48   I would propose that while the sentences imposed in relation to counts 1 and 5 should stand, those in respect of counts 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 should be quashed. In lieu thereof, the following sentences should be imposed: 
     
      
     Count 2 
      Fixed term of imprisonment for four years, to commence on 31 July 1998 and to expire on 30July 2002. 
      
      
     Count 3 
      Fixed term of imprisonment for six years to commence on 31 July 1998 and to expire on 30 July 2004. 
      
      
     Count 4 
      Fixed term of imprisonment for four years to commence on 31 July 1998 and to expire on 30 July 2002. 
      
      
     Count 6 
      Fixed term of imprisonment for six years to commence on 31 July 1998, and to expire on 30 July 2004. 
      
      
     Count 7 
      Imprisonment for nine years to be served partly concurrently and partly consecutively with the sentences imposed for the remaining counts and for that reason, to commence on 31 July 2001, and to expire on 30 July 2010, with a non parole period of five years similarly to commence on 31 July 2001. The earliest date for release upon parole would accordingly be 31 July 2006. 
      
    49   These sentences, I repeat, remain less than those that might have been properly imposed at first instance, because of the double jeopardy principle. They are sentences which I would reach after taking into account decisions of this Court, concerning comparable offenders, such as Bell NSWCCA 11 May 1993, London [2000] NSWCCA 165; Ryan [2000] NSWCCA 98 and Dwight [2000] NSWCCA 164, and also after making a reduction for the pleas by the factor previously mentioned, in accordance with S 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and Thompson and Houlton. I would decline to set non parole periods for all counts but for count 7, because the length and accumulation of the sentence imposed in respect of that count means that no point would be served by any such order. 
    50   It is in relation to count 7 that I would take into account the Form 1 offences, and it is for that reason, and also to mark the accelerating, and ultimately the total criminality of the respondent encompassed by the separate matters in the indictment and the Form 1, that I would significantly enlarge the sentence for this count, and direct that it be served partly consecutively upon the remaining sentences. The effect of the orders I impose would be to extend the total period of imprisonment, and the period during which the respondent would be ineligible for release, by a period of two years, i.e. to periods of twelve and eight years respectively, and to provide for a period of potential release on parole of four years. 
    51   In fixing that non parole period, I have had regard to the interests of the respondent, and of the community, in providing an adequate period for post release supervision. The case is not one where there is any particular reason to afford leniency by reference to the matters examined by King CJ in Osenkowski (1982) 20 SASR 212 at 213-213. I am, in particular, not convinced that there is reason to suppose that the respondent may have reached a turning point in his life, or has demonstrated any clear intention of rehabilitating himself. A significant period of post release supervision on parole is justified, however that does not justify reducing the non parole period to one that fails to appropriately reflect the criminality for which the respondent is to be resentenced: Morrissey NSWCCA 15 July 1994, and McDonald NSWCCA 12 October 1998. 
    52   The re-sentence does lead to a relatively small variation in the proportions which the non parole (minimum term) and total sentence (minimum term and additional term) now bear. However, I am of the view that the period for potential supervision on parole, which remains the same as that fixed by her Honour, is both adequate and appropriate to reflect the interests of rehabilitation identified in R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114, and is such as not to reduce the sentence below one that would comply with the principles identified in Morrissey. 
    53   GREG JAMES J: I agree with Wood, CJ. at CL.

     REGINA v A T 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   STUDDERT J: The appellant, to whom I shall refer simply as “AT”, stood trial in the District Court at Parramatta in March 1999 charged with the commission of eight sexual offences against his stepdaughter. It was the prosecution case that these offences were committed over a period in the complainant’s childhood between the ages of eleven and thirteen years. The offences were allegedly committed between May 1992 and December 1994. The appellant was convicted of six of the eight offences charged and was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment in respect of the various convictions. The effect of the sentences imposed was that the appellant was required to serve altogether a minimum term of four years and an additional term of two years six months, with all the sentences backdated to commence on 23 March 1999, when the appellant was taken into custody. 
     
      
       
      
    2   The appellant appeals against his conviction on a number of grounds which I will consider in due course. He also seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed. 
     
      
       
      
    3   The complainant, CT, was born in the Philippines on 28 January 1981. Her mother later married the appellant and when the complainant was three and a half years old she joined her mother, RT, and the appellant, her stepfather, in Australia. The home was at Rosehill, originally comprising a two bedroom granny flat at the back of the main house. The family consisted of the appellant, the complainant’s mother, the complainant and her half-brother, ATJ, who was born to the appellant and the complainant’s mother in February 1984. The family moved into the main house in front of the granny flat in 1994. All the offences charged were alleged to have been committed in the home environment. 
     
      
       
      
    4   I will now consider the complainant’s evidence as to the various grounds in the indictment. 
     
      
       
        
       Count 1 
        
       
      
    5   In May 1992 around Mothers’ Day, the child ATJ was struck by a car and was taken to hospital. According to the complainant, whilst her mother was away from home at the hospital the appellant asked the complainant to remove her clothing and she did so. As she lay naked on her mother’s bed, the appellant rubbed her breasts. 
     
      
       
        
       Count 2 
        
       
      
    6   About one month later whilst the complainant’s mother was at work and the complainant was at home with the appellant, he told her to remove her pants and she lay on the bed. The appellant joined her, removing his pants and underwear and they lay under the doona. The appellant then touched the complainant’s vagina with his hand and then had the complainant place her hand on his penis. 
     
      
       
        
       Count 3 
        
       
      
    7   Whilst the complainant’s mother was at work, the appellant showed the complainant a pornographic video in the granny flat, fast forwarding it to a part where a woman was giving a man oral sex. The appellant then removed his pants and lowered his underpants and had the complainant place his penis in her mouth. The appellant withdrew his penis before ejaculation. 
     
      
       
        
       Count 4 
        
       
      
    8   On another occasion whilst the complainant’s mother was at work, the appellant and the complainant were on the bed in the main bedroom in the granny flat. The appellant had his pants off and the complainant had her pants off and the appellant told the complainant to sit on top of him. The complainant straddled the appellant, who tried to insert his penis into her vagina. The complainant protested that this hurt and the activity ceased. 
     
      
       
        
       Count 5 
        
       
      
    9   The appellant was doing renovations to the house in front of the granny flat and on an occasion when the complainant was assisting him in some painting the appellant told the complainant to wear a dress without underwear and after she had attired herself in this fashion, went with the appellant into a bedroom where the complainant lay on the floor. The appellant lifted her dress and put his tongue around and in her vagina. He then removed his pants and placed his penis in her mouth, removing it prior to ejaculation. 
     
      
       
        
       Count 6 
        
       
      
    10   In April 1994, the complainant, with a school friend, was suspected of smoking in the toilets at school. The complainant had to take a letter home to her parents on 28 April 1994. The letter requested the appellant and the complainant’s mother to attend at the school at a nominated time on 29 April. The appellant woke the complainant up at about 5.00 am that morning and told her to go to the granny flat where he was writing a note for her to take to school. In the granny flat the appellant questioned the complainant about her conduct at school the day before and then told her to go to the bedroom where he handled her vagina. This conduct was interrupted when the complainant’s mother came to the front door of the granny flat and knocked on it. 
     
      
       
        
       Count 7 
        
       
      
    11   Whilst the complainant’s mother was away at work, the complainant, the appellant and ATJ went into her room to watch television. They lay on the bed under the doona and the appellant placed his finger inside her vagina.  
     
      
       
      
    12   According to the complainant this was not an isolated incident and her evidence was that whilst her mother was at work there was sexual activity on a weekly basis unless the complainant was experiencing a period. 
     
      
       
        
       Count 8 
        
       
      
    13   On an occasion which the complainant placed as being the night before Christmas Eve in 1994 the complainant was in bed. The appellant came in and joined her under the bed covers. He touched her on the vagina. The complainant cried and protested that she did not want to do this anymore and the appellant desisted. 
     
      
       
      
    14   According to the complainant, the appellant persisted in abusing her sexually until about a month before she left home in November 1995. 
     
      
       
      
    15   ATJ gave evidence that he was born on 8 February 1984 and that he went to hospital in 1992 after a motor vehicle accident. His mother stayed overnight with him in hospital. He remembered living in the granny flat and later moving into the main house. He recalled that his mother worked on Saturdays and some weekdays. He did recall that there were occasions when he, CT and the appellant lay in the appellant’s bed watching television. He said this happened two or three times on Saturdays. He never saw the appellant do anything improper to CT. 
     
      
       
      
    16   RT gave evidence that she married the appellant in October 1982 but separated in March or April 1998, after which ATJ lived with the appellant. RT said that CT came to live with her and the appellant in Australia in 1984 at the property at Rosehill. RT said they lived in the granny flat before moving into the main house, an event which she placed as occurring in 1992. RT worked in a newsagency from Mondays to Fridays between 9.30 am and 5.30 pm. After some three years she took a position at BP at Rosehill from about August 1994 and worked three days from 8.00 am to 4.00 pm and also worked on Saturdays from 4.00 pm until midnight. There was a change in that arrangement of working hours at a point of time after the last of the alleged offences. She said that on the day ATJ was injured in the accident she spent the night at hospital with him. RT recalled one occasion seeing CT, AT and the appellant lying on the bed in the main house watching television, and the witness said that she was aware that the appellant had pornographic videos in the granny flat, at least in 1992 to 1993. RT confirmed that there were times when CT and the appellant were in the main house alone. RT remembered being told by the appellant that CT was concerned that she had missed her period and had gone to a doctor at Newtown. RT remembered the incident involving the allegation of smoking at school and said that on the morning after she learnt of this she went to the granny flat prior to 6.00 am and knocked on the door about six times before the appellant opened it. She went in and noticed the appellant was wearing pyjamas. She said that when she entered the granny flat, CT was sitting on a chair. RT said that there documents and pens on a table inside the granny flat. 
     
      
       
      
    17   Dr Panopoulos gave evidence of an occasion when she examined CT but I shall review that evidence in the context of considering Ground 1. 
     
      
       
      
    18   A number of witnesses gave evidence of complaint.  
     
      
       
      
    19   A school friend gave evidence that at school in 1995 CT told her words to the effect that “her step dad keeps touching her, locking him and her in the room and turning the music on.” It is to be observed that the complainant denied giving that account of the appellant’s behaviour in cross examination, but the complainant said she did tell her schoolfriend her stepfather had been “doing things” to her. CT told her girlfriend that she was scared and she cried when she made the complaint, which the friend relayed to her own mother and then she accompanied CT to a teacher. 
     
      
       
      
    20   Ms Wilson said that she was a supervisor of girls at CT’s school and that it was on 7 November 1995 CT came to her in the company of two girlfriends. CT complained to her that the appellant had been sexually abusing her since she was eleven years of age and that the abuse usually took place on weekends when her mother was out of the house. The abuse included asking her to undress, digital penetration, asking CT to sit on him and giving him a “head job”. 
     
      
       
      
    21   Peta Wicks gave evidence as a district officer at DOCS. She saw CT at school on 7 November 1995 when CT complained that she had been undressed by the appellant. She said that the abuse started on a night when her brother was in hospital following an accident and her mother stayed overnight at the hospital. She reported mutual touching and fondling, and that the appellant touched her vagina. According to Ms Wicks, the complainant said the abuse continued to occur on a regular basis after that and the complainant also complained of digital penetration of her vagina and oral sex. She said that she touched the appellant’s penis and that he had attempted penile penetration more than once. 
     
      
       
      
    22   Detective Senior Constable Carol gave evidence that she spoke to CT on 10 January 1996 and again on 4 May 1996 but CT was not willing to proceed with the allegations. 
     
      
       
      
    23   Later, however, she did so and Detective Senior Constable Gordon gave evidence of speaking to the appellant on 12 August 1997. He arranged an interview which occurred six days later. At that interview the appellant denied any wrongdoing with CT. 
     
      
       
      
    24   The appellant gave evidence at the trial and good character was raised. The appellant denied that he ever touched CT in a sexual way. He said that before renovations were commenced on the main house in 1992 he and the family lived in the granny flat and that after the renovations were completed the house was let for about three months so that the family moved into the house early in 1994. He remembered ATJ’s admission to hospital after a car accident and he said that he spent the night at home with CT but denied any sexual impropriety. He said that he did own some pornographic videos in 1992 and early in 1993, but they were stolen then and at no time did he show them to CT. 
     
      
       
      
    25   The appellant said that there was an occasion when CT told him that she had missed her period and he called his relative Jenny Cahill who worked at DOCS. It was this relative that suggested the child be taken to Dr Panopoulos. He denied CT’s assertion that he had told her what to say to the doctor and in particular he denied that he had told her to suggest that she had been playing around with a boyfriend. 
     
      
       
      
    26   The appellant admitted that there were three times when he and CT and ATJ watched television while lying on the bed but he denied touching CT in a sexual way. 
     
      
       
      
    27   The appellant remembered the occasion when CT was in trouble about smoking and he said that he did take her to the granny flat the next morning and he then wrote a letter to the school about the smoking incident but he denied any sexual activity in the granny flat with the complainant. 
     
      
       
      
    28   The appellant called a retired solicitor who gave evidence that could be categorised as evidence of good character. 
     
      
       
      
    29   The appellant was convicted on counts 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 but was acquitted on counts 1 and 8. 
     
      
       
      
    30   I now turn to consider the various grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 1: Evidence led by the Crown of the complainant’s lack of sexual experience was in contravention of s 409B of the Crimes Act 1900 and led to a miscarriage of justice 
        
       
      
    31   After the attempted sexual intercourse the subject of Count 4, the complainant’s evidence was that she missed her period and her concern was that she might have been pregnant. The complainant spoke to the appellant, who suggested that she speak to her mother about it and the complainant told her mother that she had not had sex with anyone. Her mother told her there was nothing to worry about. Nevertheless the complainant’s anxiety continued and the appellant took her to Dr Panopoulos at Newtown. The complainant said that on the way to the doctor’s surgery the appellant told her to tell the doctor that she had been “mucking around” with her boyfriend, and that she felt something wet come onto her vagina. 
     
      
       
      
    32   Dr Panopoulos told the court of the history given by CT which was that her period was overdue by two and a half weeks. The complainant expressed concern to her about a sexual contact with a boy in late February and said that although there had been no vaginal penetration, she was uncertain whether the boy had ejaculated near her vaginal outlet. The doctor took a blood sample for testing and the testing proved that the child was not pregnant. 
     
      
       
      
    33   The complainant’s mother, when called, said that the complainant did not tell her anything about having missed her period but that the appellant told her about the visit to the doctor after this visit had taken place. He then told the complainant’s mother that the complainant was worried about missing her period. The appellant said, according to the mother, “Maybe she’s got a boyfriend”, to which the mother replied, “She hasn’t got a boyfriend” (AB 182). 
     
      
       
      
    34   It is in this setting that the evidence which the appellant argues attracted s 409B of the Crimes Act was given. 
     
      
       
      
    35   According to the complainant, after she had spoken to her mother at the suggestion of the appellant, she reported to the appellant: “I said, like I repeated what Mum had said like. I haven’t had sex with anyone, so there’s nothing to worry about…” (AB 79). Then there was the evidence of the mother in relation to the conversation she had had with the appellant: “Why would she be worried about her period when she’s a virgin and she’s not having sex with anyone” (AB 181). 
     
      
       
      
    36   Ms Burgess has submitted that that evidence was inadmissible under s 409B of the Crimes Act. This section was, of course, repealed by Act No. 94 of 1999, but the provision remains substantially in place as s 105 of the Criminal Procedure Act. The transfer of the provision did not come into operation until 1 January 2000 so that it is relevant to heed s 409B as applicable for this trial. The ground argued focuses on s 409B(3) which provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
          “(3) In prescribed sexual offence proceedings, evidence which discloses or implies that the complainant has or may have had sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience or has or may have taken or not taken part in any sexual activity is inadmissible except: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) where it is evidence: 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (i) of sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience of, or sexual activity or a lack of sexual activity taken part in by, the complainant at or about the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed offence; and 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (ii) of events which are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed offence was committed; 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) where it is evidence relating to a relationship which was existing or recent at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, being a relationship between the accused person and the complainant; 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) where 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (i) the accused person is alleged to have had sexual intercourse, as defined in s 61H(1), with the complainant and the accused person does not concede the sexual intercourse so alleged; and 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (ii) it is evidence relevant to the presence of semen, pregnancy, disease or injury is attributable to the sexual intercourse alleged to have been had by the accused person…” 
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    37   It has been submitted on behalf of the appellant that although no objection was taken at the time the evidence was introduced, the evidence that the complainant had no sexual experience other than the experience with the appellant, no boyfriend, and, by implication, no opportunity for a sexual experience other than with the appellant, was inadmissible because it did not fall under any of the categories contemplated in sub-s (3). 
     
      
       
      
    38   The Crown has submitted that the section has not been infringed. Regard has to be had to the context in which the evidence was given, and what CT was telling her mother about not having had sex with anybody of course involved no complaint about what CT claimed the appellant had done to her in attempting penile intercourse. The evidence was relevant evidence of the relationship between the appellant and CT. The evidence given by RT to the effect that there was no need for concern was only a repetition of what CT had told her at the time when she expressed her fear of being pregnant and that she had spoken to her mother at all about the mother was at the urging of the appellant. 
     
      
       
      
    39   The Crown submitted that the evidence was led without objection and was the subject of no application by counsel for the appellant at the trial once it had been introduced. Its introduction involved no improper prejudice to the appellant having regard to the circumstances in which it was introduced. I accept that submission, and that the introduction did not cause the trial to miscarry. 
     
      
       
      
    40   Because no objection was taken to the introduction of the evidence at the trial and because the trial judge was not asked to make any decision about that evidence once it had been introduced, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies.  
     
      
       
      
    41   Since I do not consider that the introduction of the evidence did involve any improper prejudice to the appellant, I would refuse leave to the appellant to rely upon this ground. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 2: 
        
       
      
    42   This ground relates to certain evidence which was not led at the trial and it is contended that the failure to lead this evidence resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The ground relates to Count 4 in the indictment. 
     
      
       
        
       (a) There is evidence, not led at trial, of an explanation for the complainant’s fear of pregnancy other than the alleged conduct of the appellant 
        
       
      
    43   The evidence which was not used at the trial was evidence contained in a notebook or diary kept by the complainant. There are two entries in particular in this document which, on the appellant’s submission, assume significance for the purposes of Ground 2(a). Whilst there is no entry in the diary for 26 February 1993 (and that was the date that the complainant mentioned as being the relevant date of sexual activity with a boyfriend when she saw the doctor), there is an entry for 18 February 1993 (AB 51): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “On Tuesday afternoon I went over to Dan’s place at Dartbrook Road, in Auburn. 
         
        
        
         
         I went into his room and looked around, a bit later on we saw his Mum coming. And I was just about to leave though his Mum was near the door, I ran into his room and hid in his bed. Then I swapped around and hid in his wardrobe. It was a real funny classic…” 
         
        
       
      
    44   The diary records for 22 March 1993: “Visit to the doctor”, but nothing else. 
     
      
       
      
    45   However, there is a later entry in the diary (AB 55) which has no date but it is obviously some time after the previous page (AB 54) which refers to Friday 7 May. The entry reads: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Today we got an afternoon detention and it is on next Wednesday. 
         
        
        
         
         Amoud’s a feeler. He feel me and I feel his dick. He doesn’t stop. Nelab said that I have to pull Daniel’s dick. I will only do it if Lisa come with me.” 
         
        
       
      
    46   The submission is that those diary entries warranted an application for leave to cross examine the complainant under s 409B(5): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “(5) In prescribed sexual offence proceedings, where the court or justice is satisfied that: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (a) it has been disclosed or implied in the case for the prosecution against the accused person that the complainant has or may have, during a specified period or without reference to any period: 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (i) had sexual experience, or a lack of sexual experience, of a general specified nature; or 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
             (ii) taken part or not taken part in sexual activity of a general or specified nature; and 
             
            
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) the accused person might be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross examined by or on behalf of the accused person in relation to the disclosure or implication, the complainant may be so cross examined but only in relation to the experience or activity of the nature (if any) so specified during the period (if any) so specified.” 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    47   It seems to me that the entry for 18 February 1993 is a long way from affording a basis for the inference of some sexual relationship. 
     
      
       
      
    48   So far as the later entry is concerned, it is not dated, but it is hardly evidence as to a relationship either existing at the time of the attempted act of sexual intercourse or recent at that time. To the extent that it refers to some contemplated activity with Daniel, what the entry does suggest is that this is not something that the complainant has done and, indeed, she writes that she will only do it if accompanied by Lisa. It is a very, very immature diary entry. 
     
      
       
      
    49   There is a further problem, as I see it, about these diary entries. The appellant had the diary available to him. His affidavit sworn on 28 July 2000 indicates that he discovered it in the complainant’s bedroom in November 1995 and he gave it to his solicitor. According to the appellant, his counsel told him that he could not use the book. Although this was not explained to the appellant, it is a reasonable inference to draw, if counsel gave him that advice, that counsel did not think justification existed for the necessary application for the purposes of s 409B(5). It would be reasonable to infer that counsel perceived shortcomings in the nature of those entries such as those to which I have adverted. There is a letter from counsel which comprises Annexure B to the affidavit of Mary Spiers Williams sworn 2 August 2000. Counsel commented that having read the entries it was his opinion that the material fell well short of grounding a successful s 409B application. At the same time counsel noted that he was now unable to recall whether he had been given the diary. 
     
      
       
      
    50   It is for the appellant to persuade this Court that the failure to use the diary evidence resulted in a miscarriage of justice. In their joint judgment in Mickelberg v The Queen (1988) 167 CLR 259, Toohey and Gaudron JJ expressed the test for fresh evidence at 301: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The underlying rationale for a court of criminal appeal setting aside a conviction on the ground of fresh evidence is that the absence of that evidence from the trial was, in effect, a miscarriage of justice: see, eg, Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392, at pp 395, 402, 410.. There is no miscarriage of justice in the failure to call evidence at trial if that evidence was then available, or, with reasonable diligence, could have been available: see Ratten v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 510, at pp 516-517., per Barwick CJ, noting however, that there may be somewhat greater latitude in the case of criminal trials than in the case of civil trials. See also Lawless v The Queen (1979) 142 CLR 659, at pp 666, 675-677. 
         
        
        
         
         There is no very precise formulation of the quality which must attach to fresh evidence before it will ground a successful appeal. It has been said that it must be ""credible"", ""cogent"", ""relevant"", ""plausible"": see, eg, Gallagher (1986) 160 CLR, at pp 395-396, 401-402, 408-409; Craig v The King (1933) 49 CLR 429, at p 439; Ratten (1974) 131 CLR, at pp 519-520; Lawless (1979) 142 CLR, at pp 671, 676-677.. In essence, the fresh evidence must be such that, when viewed in combination with the evidence given at trial, it can be said that the jury would have been likely to entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused if all the evidence had been before it (Gallagher (1986) 160 CLR, at p 410., per Brennan J) or, if there be a practical difference, that there is ‘a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the [accused]’ (Gallagher (1986) 160 CLR, at p 399., per Gibbs CJ and per Mason and Deane JJ (1986) 160 CLR, at p 402.).” 
         
        
       
      
    51   Then in R v Hemsley (unreported, NSWCCA, 29 November 1995) Hunt CJ at CL, with whose judgment the other members of the court agreed, said in point (at pp 4-5): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “As stated by the majority in Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 399, 402 what must be established in support of a claim that there is fresh evidence is that the absence at the trial of the evidence upon which reliance is placed by the appellant resulted in a miscarriage of justice; an appellate court will so conclude in favour of the appellant only if it considers that there is a significant possibility that the jury at his original trial, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant if that evidence had been before them (see also Michelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259 at 273, 301-302). In Mickelberg v The Queen (at 273, 275, 301-302) the High Court left open whether such a test differs from others which had been stated by it from time to time, but that is the test which has usually been applied by this Court (see, for example, Regina v Zaidi (1991) 57 A Crim R 189 at 193; Regina v Tuckey (1991) 57 A Crim R 464 at 472; Regina v Asfour (1992) 60 A Crim R 409 at 413; Regina v Goonan (1993) 69 A Crim R 338 at 341-342; Regina v Barnett (1994) 71 A Crim R 515 at 529; Regina v Boag (1994) 73 A Crim R 35 at 38) and by other appellate courts in Australia (see, for example, Federal Court: Cheney v The Queen (1991) 99 ALR 360 at 365; Victoria: Regina v Vincec (1990) 50 A Crim R 203 at 210-211; Queensland: Regina v Condren (1990) 49 A Crim R 79 at 80; Regina v Scouller (1995) 76 A Crim R 487 at 501; Western Australia: Regina v Bond (1992) 67 A Crim R 383 at 386-387, 422-423, 439; Northern Territory: Regina v Crabbe (1990) 49 A Crim R 446 at 449 [This was the appeal from the second trial, in which the appellant was again found guilty of murder, following the decision of the High Court: (1985) 156 CLR 464]. In some cases, emphasis has been placed upon the statements made in the High Court that there should be no absolute or hard and fast rules where the fundamental question is whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred (see, for example, Green v The King (1939) 61 CLR 167 at 175; Gallagher v The Queen (at 395, 413), and occasionally the relevant court has said that, whatever difference there may possibly be between the various tests stated, the evidence in the particular case satisfies either both tests being considered or neither. 
          
          
         Bearing in mind the nature of the fundamental question involved - whether there has been a miscarriage of justice - I prefer to retain the test as it has been stated at the commencement of the last paragraph, but I recognize the absence of any absolute or hard and fast rules. Relevant to that test is the credibility and the cogency of the evidence put forward, considered in the context of the evidence which was given at the original trial (Craig v The King (1933) 49 CLR 429 at 439; Gallagher v The Queen (at 395-396), 300, 401-402, 408-409).  
         There is no miscarriage of justice if that evidence was available to be called at that trial and if the appellant had been content to go to trial without it  
         (Lawless v The Queen (1979) 142 CLR 659 at 666, 675; Mickelberg v The Queen (at 301), Regina v Asfour (at 413).  
         He will not be given a second trial simply because the material which he was content to produce at the original trial was unsuccessful in achieving the result which he sought to achieve and because the result at a second trial with the additional evidence may be different 
         . That is not, of course,, a universal and inflexible rule, but it will be departed from only in unusual circumstances; those circumstances will ordinarily be related to the strength of the fresh evidence in question (Gallagher v The Queen (at 395); Regina v Goonan (at 342)).” 
         
        
       
      
    52   This diary evidence was available for use at the trial. The appellant is not entitled to have a second trial simply because he failed at the first trial without using it and the result may be different if he was able to use it at a second trial. Having considered the diary evidence in point, I am not persuaded that there was any miscarriage of justice because it was not employed at the appellant’s trial in the manner now contemplated.  
     
      
       
      
    53   In my opinion Ground 2(a) fails. 
     
      
       
        
       (b): There is evidence, not led at trial, confirming the appellant’s explanation why he took the complainant to a doctor at Newtown for a pregnancy test 
        
       
      
    54   The appellant took the complainant to a doctor chosen by him away from the suburb where he lived. This decision was referred to in a passage in the summing-up which perhaps reflects something that was said in the Crown Prosecutor’s final address to the jury (AB 306-307). Referring to the visit to the doctor, the judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “I do not propose to go into all of that, it has been touched upon by both counsel this morning as to what view you would take of that whole incident. Whether you regard it as just a quite normal occasion in which the accused sought help, as it were, by speaking to a relative and then took [the complainant] to the doctor at Newtown, or whether you take the view that has been put by the Crown that this is a very peculiar form of behaviour.” 
         
        
       
      
    55   The evidence given by the appellant was that he spoke to his relative, who happened to be Jenny Cahill and who worked with the Department of Community Services. He told her that his doctor was a male and it was suggested to him that it might be better to take the complainant to a female doctor and the appellant was then given the name of the doctor who examined the complainant. Ms Cahill was not called at the trial and the appellant was cross examined about Jenny Cahill and the failure to arrange for her to give evidence (see AB 269-270). 
     
      
       
      
    56   The appellant submits that there was a miscarriage of justice because this relative, Jenny Cahill, was not called. There is an affidavit from Jennifer Cahill (AB 40-42) which discloses the evidence she would have been able to give. That evidence is consistent with the evidence given by the appellant to the effect that it was Jennifer Cahill who nominated the doctor to whom the appellant took the complainant. This witness would also have been able to give evidence as to the appellant’s good character. 
     
      
       
      
    57   It is not at all clear why Jennifer Cahill was not called but the appellant’s affidavit filed in support of this particular ground makes it clear that he would have been able to secure her attendance had he been asked to do so (see para 11, AB 5). The letter from counsel, to which I made earlier reference (AB 57), discloses that his recollection is that Jennifer Cahill was unavailable at the time and that the appellant wanted the trial to proceed regardless. The recollection of his instructing solicitor at the time (AB 44, para 7) was that either the witness was unavailable or that the appellant did not know where she was. His recollection was that the appellant wanted the trial to proceed. 
     
      
       
      
    58   It seems fairly clear that the witness could have been called if need be. A decision was made not to call her, or alternatively no attempt was made to call her. Consistently with what was said in Hemsley, the appellant is not to be given a second trial simply because the result of the second trial with the additional evidence may have been different. Counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial was experienced and generally speaking a party to legal proceedings is bound by the way counsel conducts his case: see R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 683-684. I am not persuaded that any miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated by reason of the failure to call this witness at the trial. 
     
      
       
      
    59   Ground 2 fails. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 3: Her Honour erred in failing adequately to direct the jury about the significance of delay in complaint 
        
       
      
    60   The last of the offences charged, and this is one of the two offences in relation to which the appellant was acquitted, allegedly took place at Christmas time in 1994. The complainant left home some eleven months later in November 1995 and she then made complaint to her school friend, to the school counsellor and to the officer of the Department of Community Services. The complainant was placed in foster care in November 1995 and it was not until January and May 1996 that she first made a statement to police about the allegations but at that time she was unwilling to press charges. CT spoke to police again in May 1997 and it was not until August 1997 that the appellant was interviewed by police and denied the allegations. 
     
      
       
      
    61   The trial judge gave the following directions upon delay in complaining in the course of the summing-up: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “That is a matter which you should consider of course, that delay in complaint, but I should warn you that mere delay in making a complaint does not necessarily indicate that the evidence of [the complainant] is false. It may be an indication of fabrication on her part but that is not necessarily so. A direction to consider whether delay in complaint may indicate fabrication is given in every case of sexual assault in which there has been no complaint at the time the assault in which there has been no complaint at the time the assault is said to have occurred. That is not a reflection of my opinion, you are the judges of the fact, not me. That is just some of the evidence which you will consider and decide, what weight is to be given to that fact of delay and complaint. 
         
        
        
         
         You will bear in mind, however, that there may be very good reasons why a person, particularly a child who has been sexually assaulted, does not complain at the time that sexual assault or those sexual assaults, occur. We know, regrettable though it is, that young children can be the victims of sexual assault. Where the assailant is a stranger we might more readily expect that anyone, including children, will complain at the earliest opportunity. 
         
        
        
         
         A child who complains he, or she, has been sexually assaulted by a member of the household in which that child lives, might find itself in a more difficult position. You know that [the complainant] did not return to live at home after she reported these assaults. You have heard some evidence from her mother, which supports some of the rather bizarre punishments to which she was subjected, and it is perhaps worth considering that the reason put forward by [the complainant’s] mother for these punishments, was frustration at [the complainant’s] failure to communicate. You might consider whether, if she had trouble communicating in the ordinary way, she had some trouble communicating about these events. You also have to consider the position in the household, and her relationship with her mother. You know that her mother continued to live with the accused until April of last year. 
         
        
        
         
         When [the complainant] was asked why she did not complain to her mother, and she told you about the fact that she believed she had a poor relationship with her mother, and her fears about her mother, about her reaction if she should complain. She told you that she found it too embarrassing. She said, ‘You just don’t tell people that sort of thing.’ 
         
        
        
         
         You have heard other evidence which may assist you to comprehend her failure to complain at that time. But failure to complain at or about the time a sexual assault, or assaults, occur, may reflect upon the credibility of the complainant, so in evaluating her evidence it is a matter which must be considered.” 
         
        
       
      
    62   The judge then went on to remind the jury of those to whom the complainant did complain. The jury was correctly instructed that the evidence of complaint could not be used as corroboration and the jury was reminded of the submissions made as to the inconsistencies in the terms of the various complaints. The judge went on (at 293): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “You may use the evidence of complaint in this way: [the complainant’s] credit has been attacked, obviously. These allegations are said to have been fabricated. The Crown says that, in effect, you should look at those complaints to Nicole and to Mrs Wilson, and to Peter Wicks, as demonstrating a level of consistency on the part of [the complainant]. In other words, it is put that it is relevant to her credit in that you are entitled to look at reasons why she says she did not complain when these things happened, and the circumstances in which you find she did make the complaint, after she left home, and is insisting she would not go back. You are entitled to look at her conduct at the time she did complain, and if you find that is consistent with the explanation she has given, that may give weight to her evidence in your mind.” 
         
        
       
      
    63   The judge was asked by counsel at the trial to add to the directions given by expanding upon the consideration of the significance of delay and the decision in R v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362 was cited. 
     
      
       
      
    64   It was emphasised in Johnston that what is required by way of comment or direction must depend on all the circumstances of the case: see the judgment of Spigelman CJ at 369. 
     
      
       
      
    65   In the present case the only instruction given by the judge in the summing-up as to the significance of delay appeared in the context of reviewing the case for the appellant. Having reminded the jury of the appellant’s denial that any of the sexual assaults occurred, the judge went on (AB 299): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “These allegations were first brought to the attention of the accused some years after they were said to have occurred. Necessarily, any substantial delay in complaint tends to hamper the accused in mounting a defence, because memory does fade over time which applies to everybody who is involved in a trial of this nature. That is a matter which you will bear in mind in assessing the case for the accused.” 
         
        
       
      
    66   Counsel at the trial submitted that the direction was inadequate and pointed to the appellant’s problems being compounded by the lack of precision as to the dates of the alleged offences and the difficulties in testing the complaints that arose because of this. Counsel also drew attention to the difficulties of recall of events.  
     
      
       
      
    67   In this case there was a five year gap between the date upon which the first of the offences was alleged to have been committed and the date that the appellant was first interviewed by the police. That is a very substantial period and it seems to me, consistently with Johnston, that this enlivened a need for the trial judge to give such warning as ensured the fairness of the trial. The offences charged in the indictment were alleged to have occurred in the following time frames: 
     
      
       
        
       Count 1: Between 3 May 1992 and 6 May 1992; 
        
        
       Count 2: Between 1 May 1992 and 1 July 1992; 
        
        
       Count 3: Between 1 June 1992 and 31 January 1993; 
        
        
       Count 4: Between 31 December 1992 and 22 March 1993; 
        
        
       Count 5: Between 1 January 1993 and 30 June 1993; 
        
        
       Count 6: On or about 29 April 1994; 
        
        
       Count 7: Between 26 July 1994 and 1 March 1995; 
        
        
       Count 8: Between 22 and 26 December 1994. 
        
       
      
    68   In my opinion in these circumstances the instruction given to the jury as to the significance of the delay was insufficient. That instruction was necessarily double-edged. However, more was required. The effluxion of time, compounded by the imprecision of dates, deprived the appellant of the opportunity which prompt complaint would have afforded him of determining whether evidence could have been assembled to cast doubt on the evidence of the complainant and to support his evidence that no wrongdoing occurred. The jury should have been alerted by appropriate direction to the practical difficulties for the appellant in meeting the charges because of the delay. This was a case in which essentially proof of each of the offences depended upon the jury accepting the evidence of the complainant beyond reasonable doubt and the jury should have been alerted to the need to consider her evidence very carefully, and in so doing the jury should have been alerted to the significance of the practical difficulty for the appellant in endeavouring to meet the offences charged because of the time that had elapsed. 
     
      
       
      
    69   In my opinion, Ground 3 has been established. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 4: The verdicts on Counts 2-7 are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence 
        
       
      
    70   It has been submitted that the verdicts on Counts 2-7 cannot be supported and that they are unreasonable having regard to the evidence: see Fleming v The Queen (1998) 158 ALR 379 and R v Giam [1999] NSWCCA 53. 
     
      
       
      
    71   The principal matter relied upon to support this ground is the fact that the jury acquitted the appellant on Counts 1 and 8. The appellant also relied upon the substance of the grounds already considered. 
     
      
       
      
    72   It was argued that since the jury obviously entertained a reasonable doubt as to whether the offences charged in Counts 1 and 8 had been committed, the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt of Counts 2-7 because this was essentially a case in which the jury was dependent upon its assessment of the complainant on the one hand and of the appellant on the other hand. 
     
      
       
      
    73   The appellant relied upon the decision of the High Court in Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439. 
     
      
       
      
    74   In Jones the appellant was charged with three counts of sexual assault committed on the same complainant. There was a period of four years delay between the date of the first alleged offence and the making of a complaint. The jury acquitted the appellant on one of the three counts but convicted on the other two counts. The appellant succeeded in the High Court where verdicts of acquittal were directed. In their joint judgment Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said at 453: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The jury's finding of not guilty on the second count damaged the credibility of the complainant with respect to all counts in the indictment. Implicit in the appellant's acquittal on the second count was a rejection of the complainant's account of the events which were said to give rise to that count.” 
         
        
       
      
    75   After considering what the possible explanation for the different verdicts may have been, their Honours went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Whatever the explanation may be, however, the jury's rejection of the complainant's account on the second count diminished her overall credibility. The only reasonable conclusion is that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of her evidence concerning the incident the subject of the second count… 
         
        
        
         
         It is difficult then to see how it was open to the jury to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant with respect to the first and third counts. There is nothing in the complainant's evidence or the surrounding circumstances which gives any ground for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to those counts than it was in relation to the second count.” 
         
        
       
      
    76   There have been a number of decisions of this Court since Jones was decided in which the practical application of that decision has been considered. The relevant authorities were reviewed by Dunford J in his judgment in R v RAT [2000] NSWCCA 77. In RAT the appellant stood trial on six counts. The trial judge directed a verdict of not guilty on one count. Subsequently the jury found the appellant guilty of three of the remaining five counts and not guilty on two of them. On appeal the appellant argued two grounds: (i) inconsistency; and (ii) that, having regard to the evidence, the verdicts of guilty were unreasonable. 
     
      
       
      
    77   The inconsistency ground was rejected but the appeal was successful on the second ground. Having referred to the advantage that the jury had enjoyed of seeing and hearing the witnesses, and to the remarks of the judge who presided at the trial in which he recorded his assessment of the truthfulness of the complainant, Dunford J, with whose reasons and decision on this ground Barr J agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The fact remains that all counts depended on the evidence of the complainant being accepted as true beyond reasonable doubt and on the only two counts where her evidence could be set against other apparently or potentially reliable evidence, it failed to carry sufficient conviction to reach the criminal standard of proof in the eyes of the jury. There is nothing in her evidence or the surrounding circumstances which gives any ground for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to the first three counts where it could not be tested than it was in relation to the other counts where it could be, and was, tested. On the two counts where on the complainant's evidence, corroboration was available, such corroboration was not forthcoming. The very matters which justify a finding that the verdicts are not inconsistent in the sense of being a compromise are matters which call into question the complainant's credibility in respect of the counts on which the appellant was acquitted.” 
         
        
       
      
    78   Returning to the present case, how was it open to the jury to be convinced beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant on six of the eight counts when it was not so satisfied on the remaining two counts? This was essentially a case, as I have already observed, of oath against oath. There was some evidence given by the complainant’s mother which was consistent with the complainant’s evidence, at least in relation to Count 6, and the complainant’s brother gave evidence that there were several occasions on which he lay in bed with the appellant and the complainant. That evidence was consistent with the complainant’s evidence in relation to Count 7. Then there was the evidence of the visit to the doctor and the circumstances of it, which evidence was consistent with the complainant’s evidence concerning Count 4. But there was no direct evidence supporting the complainant’s account of the commission of any one of the eight offences charged. 
     
      
       
      
    79   It seems to me that there is a reasonable explanation for the acquittal on Count 8 which is not inconsistent with the jury having accepted beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was truthful in the evidence that she gave concerning Counts 2-7. The complainant was firm in her evidence that the offence was committed on 23 December 1994 and there was evidence, seemingly reliable, which the complainant’s mother gave to the effect that she did not work on 23 December 1994. Given that the complainant’s evidence was that the incident happened when her mother was at work, an explanation for the acquittal on Count 8 was that the jury, whilst accepting that the event occurred, was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it occurred at the time the complainant said it occurred. 
     
      
       
      
    80   In this regard the jury had been given the following direction in the course of the summing-up referable to Count 8: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The evidence put before you by the Crown makes it clear that if [the complainant] is correct, either her mother was not at work or she was wrong about the date, as her mother worked on 25 December. For the accused it is put to you that it shows she is not telling the truth. She was undoubtedly adamant that this happened on 23 December, and that is clearly something you are going to have to look at very carefully. The Crown must prove the elements of the case as charged, and although the Crown was alleged to amend, taking into account the totality of the evidence that the Crown had put before you, it must prove the counts as now charged. If you are satisfied, for example, that this did happen, but you cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it happened between those dates, that is between 22 December and 26 December 1994, then you must acquit the accused, even if you feel sure that the event actually occurred, because the dates are important to be proved as well. It is part of the charge the Crown must prove.” 
         
        
       
      
    81   Consistently with the above direction, the jury may have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the incident took place but it may not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant recalled the date of the offence correctly. If this be so, it still remains the position that the complainant’s evidence was not accepted as reliable. 
     
      
       
      
    82   This analysis still leaves Count 1 to be considered. What is the explanation for the acquittal on this count if the complainant’s evidence was otherwise to be accepted beyond reasonable doubt as being truthful and reliable? In relation to this count, there was, of course, the inconsistent account of what happened as given by the complainant to the psychologist. In her cross examination the complainant admitted that when she spoke to Ms Starkey in December 1995 she told the psychologist that the appellant did tell her to take her clothes off but that the appellant did not do anything to her at that time. Further she told the psychologist that he talked to her about the changes her body would be going through. The complainant agreed that she did not tell Ms Starkey that the appellant had touched her breasts. In relation to the first count, there was also the complaint made to Ms Wicks which I referred to earlier at para 21. That complaint differed in substance from what the complainant told Ms Starkey. 
     
      
       
      
    83   It may well be that, having regard to what the complainant conceded she said to Ms Starkey and/or what Ms Wicks said the complainant told her, the jury decided that it could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was an indecent assault as charged in the first count but, of course, the complainant’s evidence was that there had been such an assault. Applying the reasoning in Jones, once the jury found that the evidence of the complainant on this ground lacked the cogency to justify a conviction, how could they have approached her evidence differently on the other counts all of which depended upon an acceptance of the reliability of her evidence beyond reasonable doubt? There is, to my mind, no satisfactory answer to this question.  
     
      
       
      
    84   The verdicts on Counts 1 and 8 indicate that where there was evidence apart from that of the appellant to be set against the complainant’s evidence of an episode of sexual abuse, the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant’s evidence was reliable. The Crown was unable to point to features of the evidence concerning the remaining six counts, or any one of them, such as might indicate that the complainant’s evidence ought to have been regarded as being any more reliable in respect of the offences charged in those six counts. 
     
      
       
      
    85   It seems to me, having regard to the reasoning in Jones, that Ground 4 has been established and that this Court must intervene. The appellant’s success on Ground 3 would result in an order for a new trial, but success on Ground 4 must, as the Crown acknowledged, result in judgments of acquittal. 
     
      
       
      
    86   I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
       1. That the appeals should be allowed; 
        
        
       2. That the convictions and sentences be quashed; 
        
        
       3. That judgments of acquittal be entered. 
        
       
      
    87   SIMPSON J: I agree with the orders proposed by Studdert J and with his reasons therefor. 
     
      
       
      
    88   DOWD J: I have seen the reasons for judgment of Studdert J. I concur with the proposed orders, and with His Honour’s judgment.

      REGINA v DAVID CAMERON UPTON 
      
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
        
       
      
     1     
     SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Grove J. 
      
       
      
     2     
     GROVE J : This is an appeal against conviction following a trial before Sides DCJ and a jury in Sydney District Court. In the event that the appeal fails, leave to appeal against severity of sentence is sought. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The appellant was arraigned upon an indictment containing two counts, the first charging that between 5 and 6 September 1997 at Thredbo Village he had sexual intercourse with a complainant without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting and, second between the same dates unlawfully causing stupefying drug to be taken by that complainant with intent to enable him to commit the offence charged in the first count.  
      
       
      
     4     
     The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the first count and not guilty on the second.  
      
       
      
     5     
     The complainant was a primary school teacher aged twenty six and of Austrian nationality. She arrived in Australia at about 7 am on 3 September and was met by the appellant at the airport. Through a family friend arrangements had been made for her to be accommodated at the appellant’s home whilst in Sydney. Upon arrival at the appellant’s home at Oatley he showed the complainant to her room and around the house and told her that he usually had a spa at about this time of the day and they went outside to where there was an installation which the complainant described as a “whirlpool”. The complainant donned a swimming costume and they made use of the facility.  
      
       
      
     6     
     The appellant raised the possibility of the complainant accompanying him on a skiing trip to Thredbo on the following day. She agreed to this as she was a keen skier.  
      
       
      
     7     
     Thereafter on that day the complainant travelled by herself to look at some of the sights of the city. She arrived back at the house at about 5 pm. She was introduced to a female japanese student who was also residing at the premises and she presented a bottle of Schnapps which her mother had sent as a gift.  
      
       
      
     8     
     There were discussions about the proposed trip to the snowfields. The complainant’s version was that she was informed that the only available accommodation included a double bed and that she responded to this information by saying it wasn’t a problem so long as the appellant stayed on his side of the bed and did not snore. Later they again used the spa facility. On this occasion she was again wearing her two piece costume but said that she removed the upper portion in response to a statement by the appellant that it was common for women in Australia not to wear that portion of such a swimsuit. Photographs were taken during this activity and the complainant agreed that they might have shown the upper part of her body uncovered but the photographs were not available as she destroyed them as soon as they were developed. 
      
       
      
     9     
     The complainant retired to her room and upon awakening overturned a glass of water which was beside her bed. She had not been aware of its presence and raised the matter with the appellant who told her that he had placed it there while she was asleep as he thought she may have become thirsty. The complainant said that she had closed the bedroom door before retiring.  
      
       
      
     10     
     They departed for Thredbo the following day at about 10 am travelling by a circuitous route and not arriving at the village until about 9 pm. They made up the double bed. There was evidence that there was a trundle bed located underneath but the complainant said that she did not see it.  
      
       
      
     11     
     The complainant testified that her sleep was disturbed during the evening as the appellant was not keeping to his allocated side and that she felt constant intrusions of contact with her body either by his hand or foot. She remonstrated with him.  
      
       
      
     12     
     On the following day they proceeded onto the ski slopes. The appellant left before the complainant and there was a brief encounter when she returned to the room. The appellant had left by the time she returned from showering. The complainant spent some time with other guests in the lodge and at about 5 pm received a message that the appellant wanted her to join him at a bar in the village.  
      
       
      
     13     
     She proceeded to that location where she met the appellant and joined his company together with a couple Mr and Mrs Goold and a man whose name she recollected as Tom. They partook of some drinks, dined and later returned to the lodge. At the lodge they joined a number of guests in the communal area. Whilst there the complainant was asked to sing a traditional Austrian song and she remembered complying with this request.  
      
       
      
     14     
     The complainant’s next memory is of being in the bedroom and taking the bed clothes and preparing to sleep on the floor. Thereafter she awakened at about 7.30 am and discovered that she was wearing her pyjama top and nothing else. She was in the bed. The complainant saw her clothes lying about the floor and the appellant asleep in the bed. She wakened him and asked him a number of questions about what had occurred including a direct question as to whether they had “had sex” to which he replied in the affirmative. He also replied in the affirmative to a question whether he used a condom.  
      
       
      
     15     
     The complainant said she then rushed to the shower and washed. She dressed and left the room and the lodge. She ran to a nearby lodge where a woman telephoned Mr and Mrs Goold (whom the complainant had met the previous evening) and thereafter the complainant was taken to Cooma Hospital.  
      
       
      
     16     
     There was considerable detailed evidence from the persons whom the appellant and the complainant had encountered during this brief span of time in Thredbo Village. There was evidence as to the number of glasses of wine or other intoxicating liquor consumed by either the complainant or the appellant. There was also evidence of a conversation between the appellant and Mr Goold in which the appellant denied that he had had sexual intercourse with the complainant. The appellant, who gave evidence, did not dispute this conversation but said that he had regarded it as none of Mr Goold’s business whether he had intercourse with the complainant or not. The appellant agreed that on the day of the complainant’s arrival they had used the spa facility at his home on two occasions but denied that it was his suggestion that the complainant remove any part of her swimming costume. He asserted that whilst in the tub they had been massaging each other’s feet and shoulders and that ultimately they had removed each other’s clothing and engaged in consensual sexual intercourse. The appellant formally admitted engaging in sexual intercourse on the occasion charged in the first count of the indictment but contended that this was again consensual activity. 
      
       
      
     17     
     The grounds of appeal were expressed as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. His Honour the trial judge erred in directing the jury that the uncontradicted evidence of Dr Judith Perl about the effect of the drug Temazepam, and liquor, was inconsistent with the Appellant’s assertion that the complainant was awake after she got into the room: Summing Up 24 September 1999, 11.2 
         
        
        
         
          2. The trial judge failed to direct the jury adequately or at all as to the care with which they should scrutinise the complainant’s evidence particularly regarding her assertion of having no recollection of the act of intercourse. 
         
        
        
         
          3. The verdict is unreliable/unable to be supported by the evidence: 
         
        
        
         
          (i) The conviction on count 1 is inconsistent with the verdict of Not Guilty on Count 2; and 
         
        
        
         
          (ii) The evidence generally was insufficient to support the conviction on Count 1.”  
         
        
        
       Ground 1 
        
       
      
     18     
     Dr Judith Perl was a pharmacologist who gave evidence about the drug Temazepam. This drug (which is sold under various commercial labels) was detected by analysis of a sample of blood taken from the complainant after she was brought to Cooma Hospital. There was no issue at trial contradicting the proposition that by the time the complainant reached the bedroom on the evening of 5 September she had consumed some of this drug. Indeed no objection was taken to his Honour’s telling the jury that this was obviously so.  
      
       
      
     19     
     It was contended by counsel appearing in the appeal (who did not appear at trial) that the conduct of the Crown case was exclusively focussed upon the allegation that it was the appellant who administered the drug to the complainant. This contention was advanced in relation to all grounds, particularly grounds 1 and 3. The issue was not left to the jury on the first count on that limited basis and the absence of objection confirms that the conduct of the trial was in accordance with his Honour’s charge: 
      
       
        
         
         “I should add, so far as this count (count1) is concerned, the Crown does not have to prove where that (Temazepam) came from in the sense of whether it was administered by the accused, the complainant or someone else but the Crown would ask you to infer from the presence of the Temazepham in the blood sample taken at 1o’clock or thereabouts the next the day that she must have consumed it by the time she got into the bedroom.” 
         
        
       
      
     20     
     So far as the first count was concerned the evidence that the drug had been consumed was relevant to the jury’s ultimate conclusion about whether the complainant was asleep or unconscious when the admitted act of intercourse took place.  
      
       
      
     21     
     Dr Perl testified that the drug was used to induce sleep and had muscle relaxant properties producing not only sedation and drowsiness but dizziness and impaired coordination. Amnesia was also possible. There was evidence that the complainant was seen to buckle at the knees shortly before she went to the bedroom and persons in the lounge had prevailed upon the appellant to assist her in moving there. There was also evidence of the complainant suddenly appearing to fall asleep shortly after singing the Austrian song.  
      
       
      
     22     
     Dr Perl continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “The symptoms described by the complainant of feeling extremely tired and disoriented and then losing consciousness are perfectly consistent with the drug Temazepam.” 
         
        
       
      
     23     
     The complaint of the appellant advanced in relation to the first ground is focussed upon a comment by his Honour to the jury that the evidence from Dr Perl was inconsistent with the accused’s assertion that the complainant was awake when she was in the bedroom. 
      
       
      
     24     
     The complaint should be analysed in the context of his Honour’s remarks which were specifically directed to argument advanced on behalf of the Crown. In entirety what his Honour had said was: 
      
       
        
         
         “Well members of the jury, the Crown argues that when you look at all the evidence and all the circumstances that they rely on you would be satisfied that those circumstances were made out. You would be satisfied that she was very tired. That she was tired because of the Temazepam and the liquor and the lack of sleep and that the only conclusion that you could come to was that she was asleep or became unconscious very shortly after she got into the room and that is consistent, you might think, with the evidence of Dr Perl about the effect of the combination of that particular drug and liquor. That evidence from Dr Perl about that is not contradicted and it is inconsistent with the accused’s assertion that she was awake during that period.” 
         
        
       
      
     25     
     In this appeal attention is directed towards other evidence of Dr Perl that the particular drug was at the low end of strength in the scale of sleeping tablets. Mr Goold, a solicitor by profession, gave evidence to like effect in the course of cross examination. It is argued that the circumstance that the ingestion of the drug (particularly in combination with alcohol which would enhance its effects) was consistent with the complainant’s description of events, did not exclude the possibility that the appellant’s assertion that the complainant was awake was correct.  
      
       
      
     26     
     It is to observed that the context of the observation was in the summary of Crown argument. I would read his Honour’s statement as simply saying that the evidence of Dr Perl that consumption of the drug in the circumstances was consistent with the complainant’s version of events was capable of being contradictory of the assertion by the accused that the complainant was awake.  
      
       
      
     27     
     No application for redirection or amendment of direction was made by counsel at trial and this suggests that what was said was not seen as being an indication that the assertion by the appellant could not be accepted. The reference to the absence of contradiction in his Honour’s remarks is to the absence of contradiction concerning the effect of the combination of the drug and liquor. That this was to be understood, is confirmed by his Honour’s summary of the argument on behalf of the appellant to which he turned shortly thereafter which included references to the contention of the appellant that the complainant might have been tired but was not too tired to engage in consensual intercourse before she went to sleep. 
      
       
      
     28     
     I would reject this ground. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2 
        
       
      
     29     
     As appears from the foregoing the complainant gave no evidence of any recollection of participating in an act of intercourse with the appellant and the Crown case on this issue was circumstantial in that, if it was concluded from all the evidence that the complainant was asleep or unconscious when the act of intercourse admitted by the appellant took place, it would be inferred that she was not consenting and the appellant must have known that she was not consenting. There was no direct evidence of the complainant having fallen asleep, her memory being limited at the termini above noted and the Crown relied upon circumstantial evidence to support the inference that she went to sleep or became unconscious shortly after she entered the room. 
      
       
      
     30     
     This was not a case of direct assertion by the complainant of the commission of crime so as to parallel the facts in  
     R v Murray 
      1987 11 NSWLR 12 but it was contended that conviction required the acceptance of the substance of her evidence and therefore it was appropriate to require a direction specifically charging the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truthfulness of the account of the complainant before they could convict: compare  
     R v V 
      1998 100 A Crim R 488. 
      
       
      
     31     
     In  
     R v Davis 
      (1999) NSWCCA 15 Wood CJ at CL (Spigelman CJ and McInerney J agreeing) wrote: 
      
       
        
         
         “A  
         Murray 
          direction is appropriate where one witness stands alone in providing proof of the Crown case. That is not the present case, because there was evidence of other circumstances consistent with the complainant’s evidence in the form of her distress and prompt complaint, as well as the medical evidence, and the fact of her night walk home over a lengthy distance.” 
         
        
       
      
     32     
     There was similar evidence in this case although, somewhat favourably to the appellant, his Honour directed the jury that the complainant’s distressed condition was not available “to bolster or support the complainant’s credibility in some way” and that the evidence of distress must not be used in the process of actually determining the guilt of the appellant. 
      
       
      
     33     
     The situation that the complainant was on the verge of sleep or unconsciousness or, indeed, drifting in and out from it was not dependent only upon her evidence but the jury had available to it a considerable volume of evidence from the persons who had been in the lounge of the lodge. It matters not whether those persons considered the presentation of the complainant to be the result of jet lag, consumption of intoxicating liquor or drugs or all of them. It was open to the jury to use that evidence to contribute towards their fact finding as to whether the complainant was or was not conscious at the relevant time.  
      
       
      
     34     
     In my view it suffices to answer the complaint raised in this ground to reproduce part of the supplementary direction given by his Honour in response to a question from the jury seeking assistance on the matter of drawing inferences. His Honour said: 
      
       
        
         
         “In the context of this case and of count 1 you could not find the accused guilty in relation to count 1 and I will concentrate here on the matter in issue, namely the issue of consent and whether the complainant was asleep or unconscious or not. If you could not exclude beyond reasonable doubt the possibility that she was not asleep or not unconscious, in other words you could not exclude beyond a reasonable doubt the possibility that at the time of the act of intercourse that she was in fact awake then you would have to return a verdict of not guilty because such a conclusion would mean that you were not persuaded of the complainant’s reliability and credibility on that aspect of the case. 
         
        
        
         
         You could only find the accused guilty on count 1 if, having satisfied yourself as to the other two elements, you were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that all inferences so far as the issue of consent and the complainant’s being asleep or unconscious is concerned that you could exclude all inferences favourable to the accused and you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was in fact either asleep or unconscious in which case you would have little difficulty in finding that she did not consent.” 
         
        
        
       That direction was entirely apposite and focussed upon the critical fact which the jury had to consider. Again that direction drew no complaint from counsel at trial and I would not uphold this ground. 
        
       
      
     35     
     The appellant referred to  
     Shepherd v The Queen 
      170 CLR 573 and in particular to the remarks of Dawson J at p579 where his Honour drew attention to the necessity for a direction that an essential intermediate fact be proved beyond reasonable doubt when the Crown was reliant upon a circumstantial case. The issues which the Crown were required to prove were that the complainant did not consent to the act of intercourse and that the appellant knew that she was not consenting. The fact from which those conclusions were sought to be drawn was the fact that she was asleep or unconscious at the time. As the extract which I have recited shows, his Honour specifically told the jury that they needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that fact, indeed he told them that if there was a possibility that the complainant was awake they should acquit the appellant. 
      
       
      
     36     
     To postulate that there was an obligation upon his Honour to add to his directions that there was need to be satisfied of the complainant’s credibility beyond reasonable doubt is a requirement only to overstate the obvious, for what is suggested is no more than that his Honour should have said: “if you doubt that the complainant was asleep or unconscious it leaves open the necessary possibility that she was awake”. 
      
       
      
     37     
     I would reject this ground. 
      
       
        
       Ground 3 
        
       
      
     38     
     I turn next to the assertion of inconsistency in the verdicts on the two counts. Undoubtedly it was the Crown case that the appellant administered the stupefying drug as such were the very terms of the second count of the indictment. Evidence was called about the access of the appellant to that drug by means of a prescription which had been filled at a pharmacy in the previous month. The Crown called evidence of the presentation of the contents of small Schnapps glasses by the appellant to the complainant which she accepted from him and consumed. In common parlance, the Crown case was that the appellant spiked her drink for the purpose of removing the necessity for his obtaining her consent to his having intercourse with her.  
      
       
      
     39     
     It can be noted that the complainant conceded that she had taken a sleeping tablet in connection with her journey to Australia but she denied any further voluntary ingestion of a drug of that nature. The evidence was that the consumption of the particular drug and quantity in the circumstances conceded by her would have led to it having been dissipated from her blood by the time the test was made and the test was consistent with that in the sense that it was not traced in the sample. 
      
       
      
     40     
     The trial was fought on the basis that the Crown asserted the administration of Temazepham by the appellant and, given that it was common ground that the blood test showed the presence of that drug in the complainant’s system at the relevant time, the alternative was that the complainant’s denial that she had administered the drug to herself was false. But, to say this is only to recognize the issue raised by the second count. Proof of the first count, upon which the appellant was convicted, was left to the jury on the basis, inter alia, of the passage of his Honour’s directions set out above. 
      
       
      
     41     
     The approach to be taken by an appellate court when a ground such as this is advanced is authoritatively stated in  
     MacKenzie v the Queen 
      1996 190 CLR 348. 
      
       
      
     42     
     The appellant’s argument is not postulated upon the basis that there was legal inconsistency but that there was factual inconsistency in the different verdicts upon the two counts. The question can be formulated as an enquiry whether it was open to the jury to have a doubt about the administration of the drug by the appellant and consequently, in the context of the issues at trial, about the reliability of the complainant when she testified that she did not self administer the drug and yet come to the conclusion that she was asleep or unconscious when the appellant engaged in intercourse with her.  
      
       
      
     43     
     In my view, such conclusions were open to the jury. There was ample evidence apart from the testimony of the complainant that as she made her way to the room in the lodge she was on the verge of losing consciousness and, as I have said, whether as a result of lack of sleep or for any other reason is not to the point. It was open to the jury to be satisfied in all the circumstances that they had no doubt that the complainant was to be accepted when she testified that she was without conscious memory from the point of attempting to go to sleep on the floor and waking in the bed the following morning and it is not inevitably inconsistent with that to have a reservation about whether the administration of a drug by the appellant contributed to that span of lack of consciousness.  
      
       
      
     44     
     The Crown elected to rely upon an extremely limited opportunity of the appellant to administer the drug but it would not be and was not inconsistent for the jury to be satisfied of the essential ingredients of count 1 viz: the occurrence of intercourse (admitted), the unconsciousness of the complainant when it occurred and inevitably therefore, lack of consent and the appellant’s knowledge of that lack while declining to find beyond reasonable doubt that he administered the drug found in the blood sample. The jury may well have found that the appellant probably administered the drug but correctly applied the standard of proof to the second count. It was not necessary for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the complainant’s denial of self-administration of the drug, what were required to be proved were the ingredients abovementioned. 
      
       
      
     45     
     The second part of this ground proposes that this Court should conclude that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant on the first count.  
      
       
      
     46     
     Attention is drawn to a series of matters which are described as unsatisfactory aspects of the evidence of the complainant. No point will be served by repetitively collating all these matters which were obviously available to be canvassed, and no doubt were canvassed, at trial. In the event, it can be said that the complainant’s behaviour could be seen as less than prudent and perhaps naive but there would have been no immediate reason for the complainant to believe that she was at risk from a person with whom a homestay had been arranged through her family. One could accept that she would be fortified against any feeling of discomfort that she had by the introduction to the female japanese student who was also occupying the house in Sydney. Given the availability to the jury of the descriptions of the complainant on the verge of collapse when last seen by a large group of persons independent of the appellant and the complainant and the appellant’s description of her engagement shortly thereafter in vigorous intercourse I am unpersuaded that it was not open to the jury to conclude that the complainant had been subjected to non consensual intercourse and I am further unpersuaded that given the whole of the evidence they ought to have had a doubt about the Crown allegation. 
      
       
      
     47     
     I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
      
       
      
     48     
     The appellant was sentenced to five years penal servitude divided into minimum and additional terms of two and half years each. He had some prior convictions including for false pretences and assault but for nothing of a sexual nature. 
      
       
      
     49     
     It was expressly conceded that in sentencing the appellant the learned trial judge did not make any errors of legal principle or fact finding. It is unnecessary to epitomize his Remarks on Sentence. Argument was limited to contention that the term was manifestly excessive and towards the “top of the range” for offences of this type. The statistics produced by the Judicial Commission in a survey of forty three cases place this sentence within the upper one third of impositions. 
      
       
      
     50     
     Given the circumstances of the offence, I am entirely unpersuaded that the sentence was outside of the range of the sound exercise of discretion. 
      
       
      
     51     
     I propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed; that leave to appeal against sentence be granted but that appeal also dismissed. 
      
       
      
     52     
     KIRBY J: I agree with Grove J.

      REGINA v Jason Gordon O’DONNELL 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
    1    STEIN JA: The sole ground of appeal is that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory. For some time it has been said that this terminology is inappropriate to identify a ground of appeal in s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. From the grounds of appeal filed and the submissions made, I understand the appellant to be contending that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable or cannot be supported and that there was a miscarriage of justice. 
    2    No error is alleged in relation to the summing-up, nor in the conduct of the trial itself. The appeal therefore comes down to whether, on the evidence, the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. Was it, upon a consideration of the whole of the evidence, open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty? See M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 - 494 and Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439.  
    3    In examining the evidence the Court must assess its nature and quality, reliability and credibility, (Morris v R (1987) 163 CLR 454). Regard must also be had to the fact that the jury is entrusted with the responsibility of determining guilt or innocence and have the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses.4    The appellant was charged with 5 counts alleging various sexual assaults on the complainant late in the night of 8 July 1995 and in the early hours of 9 July 1995. Counts 1, 2 and 3 alleged aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. Counts 4 and 5 charged the appellant with acts of indecency towards the complainant.  
    5    The incidents were alleged to have taken place in a flat at Ashfield where the appellant and the complainant were present, together with the complainant's friend, Ms Kelly and Ms Kelly’s friend, Mr Fulford. The flat was Mr Fulford’s and the appellant had been living there for a short time. 
    6    Counts 1 and 2 related to events alleged to have occurred in a bedroom, while the other counts were alleged to have happened in the lounge room of the flat. Count 1 alleged vaginal penetration by penis and Count 2 penile penetration of the complainant’s mouth. Each of these offences was alleged to have been accompanied by the threat of the use of offensive weapon (a knife) against the complainant. 
    7    Count 3 alleged penile penetration of the vagina accompanied by threat of the use of a knife, indeed while the appellant was in a possession of a knife. 
    8    Count 4 alleged that the appellant masturbated to the point of ejaculation over the complainant and Count 5 alleged that he urinated over her. 
    9    The jury were instructed that if they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about the matter of aggravation in either or all of the first 3 counts, then they should find the accused not guilty. However, if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had committed a sexual assault on the complainant, they would find him guilty of the alternative counts.  
    10    On 20 March 1997 the jury returned verdicts of not guilty to Counts 1, 2 and 3 but guilty to the alternative offences of sexual assault. The jury returned verdicts of guilty to Counts 4 and 5. 
    11    On 18 July 1997 the appellant was sentenced to 7 years penal servitude on Counts 1 to 3 to be served concurrently and commencing on 23 April 1999. These sentences comprised a minimum term of 4 years and an additional term of 3 years. Concurrent fixed terms of 12 months imprisonment were imposed in relation to Counts 4 and 5. 
     
      
     The appellant’s case 
      
    12    The appellant submits that the Crown case depended on the evidence of the complainant. The acceptance of her as truthful and reliable was claimed to be crucial to the prosecution proving its case. It was submitted that her evidence was so unreliable and unbelievable that the verdicts of guilty were unsafe and unsatisfactory. A number of reasons have been advanced to support this contention. 
    13    First, it is submitted that the complaints made by the complainant were inconsistent and illogical. The complainant called out from the bedroom in which she claimed to have been twice sexually assaulted by the appellant. Her friend, Ms Kelly and Mr Fulford then entered the bedroom and the complainant made no complaint. 
    14    Later when Ms Kelly and Mr Fulford indicated that they were leaving the flat for a while, the complainant asked them not to leave but provided no reason. She did not complain about being left alone in the flat with the person she later claimed had sexually assaulted her. 
    15    When Ms Kelly and Mr Fulford returned to the flat the complainant alleged to them that she had been sexually assaulted by the appellant in the lounge room. Also, she alleged that the appellant had ejaculated over her and urinated on her jeans (Counts 3, 4 and 5). She did not complain about any sexual assaults in the bedroom (Counts 1 and 2). 
    16    In making this complaint, she did not mention any threat with a knife. The first time that she mentioned a knife threat was when making her statement to police on 9 July 1995. It was not until 19 October 1995 that she complained that the appellant had actually presented a knife to her. 
    17    In addition, it is submitted that the complainant’s evidence that the appellant ejaculated inside her in the lounge room was not supported by the scientific evidence. The same submission is made in relation to the oral sexual intercourse alleged in Count 2. 
    18    There may, of course, be good reason why a victim of sexual assault may hesitate, delay or refrain in making a complaint. Delay in a complaint may not necessarily lead to a rejection of a complainant’s evidence. However, unlike many sexual assault cases the complaint here was made at a very early stage. 
    19    Indeed, the complainant was waiting at the entrance to the flat when Ms Kelly and Mr Fulford returned after being away 45 minutes. She was shaking and crying and complained of having been raped by the appellant. They took her to hospital. On the way to the hospital Ms Kelly and the complainant got out of the car to talk. Ms Kelly testified as follows: 
     
      
       
       She said that he didn’t - that she didn’t want it, but he gave it to her anyway, that he had-when we had left she was still sitting in the lounge room and he had walked into his bedroom - I presume it was his bedroom. He came back out with nothing on, no clothes on, and sat on the armchair of the lounge I think it was and took her jeans and underpants off and she said that he’d forced his way inside of her and had come inside of her. Then once he’d finished doing that that she - that he wanted her to touch his penis and she wouldn’t, so he did it and he came all over her again and I think somewhere in the midst of that he also urinated on her. She commented that he’d urinated on her and pointed to her jeans. 
       
      
    20    Ms Kelly noticed a dark spot on the complainant’s jeans which was ‘a fairly big wet mark’. 
    21    Mr Fulford’s evidence confirmed the complainant’s distress when seen outside the flat and her claim of being raped. 
    22    Within a few hours the complainant told police of the incident in the bedroom the subject of Counts 1 and 2. 
    23    The Crown accepts that the complainant did not complain when Ms Kelly and Mr Fulford entered the bedroom after she had called out. What is apparent is that at that time the complainant was badly intoxicated and feeling ill. Shortly afterwards she began vomiting and this continued for some time. Ms Kelly and Mr Fulford entered the bedroom in response to the complainant yelling for help. The complainant said that the appellant had placed a blanket over her and himself and put his arm around her. He was naked, according to the complainant. She says that Ms Kelly yelled to the appellant to get off the complainant. Mr Fulford had wanted to pull back the blanket but the appellant had asked him not to. 
    24    This evidence was generally confirmed by Ms Kelly and Mr Fulford. The latter said that the appellant asked him not to pull the sheet back because the appellant had nothing on. 
    25    The appellant denied this and said that he was not naked and had his shorts on. He asked Mr Fulford not to pull back the cover because he was embarrassed. 
    26    The jury would have been entitled to have accepted the complainant’s evidence that the appellant was naked and rejected the appellant’s evidence, given the evidence of Mr Fulford. 
    27    Mr Fulford also gave evidence that a 20 pound weight had been placed against the bedroom door by the appellant. The jury may have been entitled to infer that the weight had been placed against the door to make it difficult for anyone to enter quickly. 
    28    In my opinion, the failure to complain about Counts 1 and 2 when Ms Kelly and Mr Fulford entered the bedroom does not assume the weighty significance argued on behalf of the appellant. 
    29    As to the failure to complain about the knife threat until later when she spoke to police, I do not see this as a matter of great significance. It was, of course, very material to the aggravation alleged in Counts 1, 2 and 3 but the central allegation was the sexual assaults about which she complained. 
    30    As to the scientific evidence, the absence of semen on the vaginal swab may not be a matter of great significance. The complainant was severely affected by alcohol at the time. She had a tampon inserted because she was menstruating. The tampon was not tested for semen. Semen was detected on her underpants, her jeans, on the lounge chair cover and in the abdominal swab. DNA testing found that it could have come from the appellant. That is, with the exception of the abdominal swab which was not tested. It should also be mentioned that urine was found on the front of the complainant’s jeans.31    Little significance should be attached to no semen being found on the mouth swab taken from the complainant. She had vomited on a number of occasions beforehand and had washed her mouth out. 
    32    The appellant submits that the verdicts of not guilty on Counts 1 - 3 of aggravated sexual assault must be based on the jury’s rejection of the complainant’s claims of the appellant’s threats with a knife. It is submitted that this rejection left the complainant without credibility. 
    33    Having rejected that evidence, it is submitted that the complainant was not left with sufficient credibility to support the alternative verdicts of sexual assaults and the guilty verdicts on Counts 4 and 5. Accordingly, it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt. 
    34    I do not accept that it follows from the findings of not guilty that the jury found that the complainant was a person of no credit and ought to have had a reasonable doubt on all of the counts. Clearly the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the element of aggravation. 
    35    On the issue of aggravation there was only the word of the complainant and the denial of the appellant - nothing more. Whereas, on the alternative counts of sexual assault and acts of indecency, there were factors present capable of supporting the complainant’s version as the truth and making the jury more confident in convicting. Some of these matters have already been mentioned. For example, the evidence supporting the complainant’s claim that the appellant was naked in the bedroom and the weight against the bedroom door. There was also the complainant’s evidence of the appellant saying that ‘Jason was going to spew about the lounge because there was blood on it’. It is clear that in saying this she was referring to Mr Fulford and not the appellant since it was Mr Fulford’s flat. Blood was found on the lounge and the complainant’s DNA was consistent with it. As already mentioned, semen that could have come from the appellant, according to DNA testing, was found on the complainant’s underpants, jeans and the lounge cover. Also, urine was found on the complainant’s jeans and this was supported by the evidence of Ms Kelly.36    There were also other factors in the evidence which tended to support the complainant’s evidence. These have been mentioned in the Crown’s oral address to us this morning. 
    37    I am not persuaded that any of the matters relied on by the appellant lead to the conclusion that the verdicts were unsafe or unsatisfactory. Indeed, it seems to me that the verdicts of the jury are readily understandable and were open on the evidence. 
    38    I do not see how it may be concluded that the jury should have had a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. The jury had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses and were in a position to make a judgment on the credibility of the witnesses including, in particular, the complainant. 
    39    I note that the original Notice of Appeal refers to an appeal against conviction and sentence. The grounds of appeal only specify that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory and no argument has been addressed to us on behalf of the appellant as to the sentence. Counsel for the appellant confirms this to be the case. 
    40    Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal and refuse to give leave to appeal against sentence since that is not pressed. 
    41    SMART AJ: I agree. 
    42    IRELAND AJ: I also agree. 
    43    STEIN JA: The order of the Court is that the appeal is dismissed. Leave to appeal against sentence is refused.

    3    FOSTER AJA: This is an appeal, pursuant to s. 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, by the Director of Public Prosecutions against sentences imposed on the respondent by Twigg DCJ at the Coffs Harbour District Court on 14 October 1999.  
     
      
    4    The respondent had pleaded guilty to five counts of fraudulent misappropriation (178A of the Crimes Act 1900) and had asked that the judge take into account a further 80 offences under the same section presented on a ""Form 2"". At the time of the commission of the offences, the respondent was a solicitor practising in Coffs Harbour. Each of the offences involved misappropriation of monies held on trust for clients. The maximum penalty prescribed by the section is 7 years penal servitude. 
     
      
    5    In respect of the first count in the indictment, his Honour, after taking into account the matters set out on the Form 2, imposed a sentence of 3 years imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention commencing on 22 October 1999. As to the remaining four counts, the judge imposed a recognizance under s. 558 of the Crimes Act, self in the sum of $5,000 to be of good behaviour for a period of five years. There were several conditions to the recognizance, including supervision by the Coffs Harbour Adult Probation Service, not applying for a Solicitor's Practising Certificate or working as a para-legal or having sole administration of trust funds. In addition, the respondent was ordered to pay reparation in the sum of $120,000 at the rate of $1,000 per calendar month, the first payment to be made on 22 October 1999. These payments were intended to reimburse, in part, the Fidelity Fund of the Law Society of New South Wales for monies paid out of the fund to the respondent's defrauded clients.  
     
      
    6    It appears that the full amount of the respondent's admitted defalcations was approximately $347,000, being the total of the amounts misappropriated between August 1989 and October 1992. This amount, as the result of sale of some real estate, had been reduced to approximately $250,000 by time of trial. 
     
      
    7    It is the Crown's contention that, in the circumstances of the case, these sentences were manifestly inadequate, should be set aside, and appropriate sentences be substituted by order of this Court, such sentences to involve full-time custodial detention  
     
      
    8    The hearing before his Honour proceeded by way of documentary evidence and oral testimony, including evidence from the respondent. A document, Exhibit B, set out an agreed statement of facts for his Honour's consideration. This statement indicated that between July 1987 and March 1993 the respondent had been in sole practice as a solicitor in Coffs Harbour under the name of Houlton and Company, solicitors. He remained in practice until 23 March 1993 when his practising certificate was cancelled by the Law Society of New South Wales. He has not practised since.  
     
      
    9    Prior to conducting a sole practice, the respondent had been a partner in another firm in Coffs Harbour. In 1986, when a partner in that firm, he commenced to act for the Estate of Reginald Maher, deceased. On instructions, he invested the proceeds of sale of two blocks of land in the estate. He had access to this investment. On 2 August 1989, by which time he was a sole practitioner, he wrongfully withdrew $14,500 from the trust fund and made a false entry for the transaction which suggested that the withdrawal was properly authorised. He used the money as a deposit for the purchase of a property at 18 Canomie Street, Sapphire for his own use. This misappropriation was the subject of the first count in the indictment.  
     
      
    10    The other offences set out in the indictment may be summarised as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""On June 17 1992 the respondent misappropriated $15,887.66 from the estate of Geoffrey David Maher. The money was used to pay arrears in his office rent. The transaction is referred to in count 2 of the indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        On 1 July 1992 the respondent withdrew a further $4,875 from the estate of Geoffrey Maher. This was paid into his office account from which he withdrew funds for his own purposes. This conduct was charged in count 3 of the indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        The 4th count refers to a fraudulent failure to account for $29,620.16 which was used by the respondent to pay for arrears in his office rental. 
        
       
       
        
        In 1990 the repondent was instructed by Mrs Barbaresco to retain certain moneys in trust. He misappropriated part of those funds, including $5,000, which is dealt with in count 5."" 
        
       
      
    11    The other 80 misappropriations set out in the Form 2 are similar in nature. 
     
      
    12    In relation to these offences, his Honour made the following comments in his remarks on sentence:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""Thus it can be seen, as was admitted by the prisoner in cross-examination on 23 September 1999, that:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          1. The sum misappropriated was approximately $347,000. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          2. Over a period in excess of three years, from August 1989 to October 1992. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          3. In a pattern of behaviour. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          4. Designed to conceal the thefts and to cover the prisoner's tracks. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          5. For the purposes of the prisoner, including keeping his practice running and for personal domestic needs. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          6. It was discovered after a complaint by a client, Jeffrey, which led to full disclosure and co-operation with the Law Society by the prisoner. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          7. That a receiver was appointed and the prisoner's practising certificate was cancelled. He was bankrupted and some moneys recovered from a sale of some real estate. There is about $250,000 outstanding to the Fidelity Fund of the Law Society of New South Wales."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    13  His Honour was provided with extensive material relating to subjective factors in the case. Exhibit 1 was a 38 page document prepared by the respondent, which provided, in considerable detail, the respondent's personal history and an explanation for the commission of the crimes. This was supplemented by three medical reports to which reference will be made later. The material is summarised in his Honour's reasons. This material indicated that the respondent had been brought up in Rhodesia (as it then was) in a ""strict and well ordered"" family. He obtained a law degree from London University and was admitted as an attorney in Rhodesia in 1969 and became a partner in a law firm in 1974. He married in 1967 and had two daughters, one born in 1971 and the other in 1976. As a lawyer he became involved in the problems of Rhodesia's transition to independence. He had been under considerable stress which had a serious effect upon his health. He developed high blood pressure and a duodenal ulcer. He began to take Valium under prescription together with Codeine. In 1976 he suffered a break down requiring psychiatric treatment and the administration of anti-depressant drugs.  
     
      
    14    He was divorced in September 1978 and in July 1979 left Rhodesia for South Africa. The divorce did not lead to full separation, in so far as his ex-wife and his two daughters accompanied him to South Africa, where he practised law in a commercial firm in Johannesburg. It appears that his life, domestic and professional, continued to be stressful and that he continued to take prescribed medication, including Valium, on a regular basis. 
     
      
    15    He had a brother residing in Coffs Harbour. As a result of a visit in May 1983 he decided to immigrate. He arrived with his family in Coffs Harbour on 11 August 1984. In July 1986 he became a partner in a local law firm. There was insufficient work, however, to sustain the partnership. It was dissolved and the respondent commenced practice as a sole practitioner taking over the previous firm's debts of $60,000. This occurred in 1987.  
     
      
    16    In January 1988 there was a final separation of the family, his ex-wife and two daughters leaving to set up separate residence. This was a most distressing period for him. In February 1988 he began an association with another woman which was productive of much personal and financial difficulty for him. The association led to marriage that year. She had a very dominating personality. She was extravagant in her spending habits. She was very disruptive domestically and also tended to interfere in his legal practice. He was at times afraid of violence from her. He asserted, and his Honour accepted, that it was as a result of her insistence on living an extravagant lifestyle that he was induced to purchase the house at Canomie Street, Sapphire. He could not borrow money for this purpose and, consequently, took the criminal step of misappropriating the trust monies which were the subject of the first count in the indictment. After taking this first step he continued to manipulate trust funds in order to finance a lifestyle that his ordinary earnings did not permit and also to keep his practice going. During this period he suffered from significant depression and worsening physical health. He took excessive amounts of Valium, which had a deleterious effect on his mental and emotional well being. He made false entries in his books to cover up the defalcations. This falsification prevented detection on annual audit by trust account inspectors. However, in late 1988 a complaint by a client relating to overcharging led to a closer inspection of his affairs by the Law Society. An investigation commenced, in which he co-operated fully and which lead to his handing in his practising certificate and to the appointment of a receiver to his practice. 
     
      
    17    It appears that, as well as the falsifications which had occurred, his records had not been properly kept. He said, in a statement accepted by his Honour, that he was ""able to attend to clients and client matters without apparent difficulty, but was just totally incapable of managing my own affairs.""  
     
      
    18    In August 1994, as a result of police investigations into the offences, he was interviewed and arrested. He did not contest the facts relating to the misappropriations. He sought, however, to rely upon his mental condition, induced by stress in both the professional and domestic spheres of his life, resulting depression, and excessive intake of Valium and other drugs as providing a defence of absence of mens rea. In the circumstances, he waived his right to a committal hearing, with the result that the charges proceeded directly to the District Court.  
     
      
    19 His Honour made the following comments in relation to the respondent's medical history, which appear to be amply justified by the medical reports before him:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is clear from the three medical reports, Exhibits 3, 4 and 5, that the prisoner was affected both by alcohol intake and the quantities of prescribed drugs that he was taking. He was suffering from generalised anxiety disorder tending to major depression. I quote from Dr Rickaby, (Exhibit 2 p 12): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          'Mr Houlton's personality, including his fear of confrontation, avoidance of emotional storms, his over-trusting nature, including his lack of judgment about his partners and use of drugs to deal with emotional symptoms, have all played a contributing part to his vulnerability.'"" 
          
         
        
       
      
    20    Additionally Dr Rickaby expressed the opinion that the offences had ""occurred during a time of escalating crisis in his life, the salient features were the destructive relationship with [his then wife], his grief over the loss of his daughters, his rapidly increasing and complicated addiction to opiates and benzodiazopines, his fear, despair and depression as he was locked in the new marriage, and his chronic brain syndrome during this time when his brain was constantly suffused with depressant drugs."" 
     
      
    21    A report from a local general practitioner confirmed that the respondent in 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993 was suffering from significant levels of stress for which Valium was constantly prescribed. There was significant evidence before his Honour that the respondent was in a mentally and emotionally impaired condition during the period when the offences were committed. There could be no doubt, however, that the defalcations and the covering up of them were deliberate acts undertaken with knowledge of their wrongfulness.  
     
      
    22    Despite the matter having been forwarded to the District Court in 1994, there was, as is apparent, considerable delay from that time until the hearing before Judge Twigg in October 1999. It appears that the respondent had, at an early stage, provided medical reports to the Crown in support of a contention that he did not have the relevant guilty mind to accompany the acts of misappropriation. It appears that there was considerable delay in considering this submission and in indicating the Crown's intentions in relation to putting the respondent on trial. There appears to be no contest that a period of three and a half years elapsed before the Crown obtained a psychiatric report of its own There were mentions before the District Court and vacation of trial dates in circumstances to which it is not necessary to make reference. They are set out in the judgment of Philip Bell DCJ, given on his Honour's refusal of an application for a permanent stay of the proceedings, the judgment being given on 17 August 1998. The delays were also referred to in the appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal from his Honour's judgment. On 18 May 1999 the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld Judge Bell's refusal to grant a permanent stay, their Honours making it clear that the trial should be brought to a hearing by the end of 1999. It was stated in the judgment of Barr J (concurred in by the other members of the Court):- 
     
      
       
        
        ""I conclude that this is a case, the outstanding features of which are that there has been substantial delay, some has been the responsibility of the court system, and some has occurred because of the emergence of events close to the intended trial dates. The length of the delay is particularly regrettable, and this case, in my opinion, calls for the kind of special management it was given for the first time in 1998. It is indeed unfortunate that on that occasion the date had to be vacated a third time."" 
        
       
      
    23    There can be no doubt that the long period of delay, whatever its cause or causes, was a matter to be taken into account by Twigg DCJ. The respondent had, apparently, entertained some hope that the Crown would, because of his medical evidence, not proceed in the matter. However, as was found by Bell DCJ, there was no factual basis for any such hope other than the long period which, apparently, elapsed from the respondent's furnishing of the medical evidence relied upon and the Crown's rejection of any defence based on it.  
     
      
    24    In the period after his loss of his practising certificate, the respondent undertook other work in the community which was of some importance and was the subject of character evidence presented to his Honour. Moreover, in that period, the respondent was able to bring about a separation between himself and his wife, which occasioned a significant diminution in his level of stress and also resulted in his conquering of his prior addiction to Valium. It would appear, consequently, that at the time he entered his plea of guilty before Twigg DCJ he was in a significantly rehabilitated state, a matter which his Honour properly took into account.  
     
      
    25    It is clear from his Honour's reasons for sentence that he was fully aware of the matters to be taken into consideration in sentencing for offences of this type. He referred in his reasons to the decision in  R v Marvin, NSW CCA, unreported 1 November 1995, a case which had some factual similarities to the present, in that Marvin was a solicitor who had made regular misappropriations of trust monies. In his judgment in that case Sully J said:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""Any solicitor who misappropriates client's funds for what ever reason, great or small, arguable good or arguably bad, commits a serious offence, not only in terms of contravening the relevant particular provisions of the Crimes Act, but in terms of the betrayal of public trust and confidence which such behaviour represents. It is appropriate to say simply that that must be regarded by the Courts, of all institutions, as serious conduct meriting in any but the most exceptional cases, a custodial sentence."" 
        
       
      
    26    Indeed Twigg DCJ, in his remarks on sentence in the present case made a statement which, in the Crown's submission to this Court, properly identifies the salient issues for sentencing in cases of this type. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""In cases of misappropriation of funds by professional people entrusted with funds, the dominant option is full time custodial sentence. The need for general deterrence is particularly important in these instances. Those who trust such professional people are entitled to have that trust recognised. The general community, and in particular the north coast community, must be listened to, because of their abhorrence at these gross breaches of trust. Not only must there be a particular warning to the prisoner, but there must be a public warning to ensure that those entrusted with funds in our community will be warned, by the harsh penalties imposed not to breach that trust. 
        
       
       
        
        I have considered the circumstances of the commission of these offences. There is a large sum involved. It was a pattern of behaviour over a three-year period during which the prisoner, although affected by anxiety and depression, deliberately defrauded his clients for his own needs. It is not entirely for greed, but rather to overcome the financial difficulties he had created."" 
        
       
      
    27    Before his Honour, the Crown Prosecutor submitted that, consistently with the established pattern of sentencing in these cases, that a full time custodial sentence should be imposed upon the respondent. His Honour did not accept this submission. In rejecting it, it can be assumed that his Honour found, in the present case, exceptional circumstances justifying the imposition of less than a full time custodial sentence. His Honour indicated the factors that he took into account in the following passage:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""I give strong weight to the subjective factors which, on my finding, are not only special circumstances, but are of such powerful importance in all the circumstances as to avoid a full-time custodial sentence.  
        
       
       
        
        I have taken into account:- 
        
       
       
        
        1. The age, past and present health, background and training of the prisoner. 
        
       
       
        
        2. His plea of guilty at the appropriate time to give him the greatest discount. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The interests of the community, particularly the north coast community. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The interest of the victims. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The need for general and particular deterrence. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The contrition and rehabilitation of the prisoner. 
        
       
       
        
        7. The absence of criminal history. 
        
       
       
        
        8. The particular circumstances of the fraud of innocent victims involving in excess of $347,000. 
        
       
       
        
        9 The application for reparation, and the need to order the prisoner to repay as part of the penalty. 
        
       
       
        
        10. The delay in bringing the criminal proceedings to a conclusion. During this time both the prisoner and the community have been affected by that delay."" 
        
       
      
    28    As the Crown contends it is apparent that the 4th, 5th and 8th matters could provide no justification for departure from the general principle requiring the imposition of a custodial sentence. So far as the first matter was concerned there would appear to be nothing relating to the age, (he was 56) training and present health of the respondent which would militate against the imposition of such a sentence. His health at the time of the commission of the offences was a matter which his Honour clearly took into consideration. The plea of guilty, of course, involved the abandonment of any claim by the respondent that he lacked the necessary mens rea in relation to the commission of the offences. Clearly, however, the evidence as to his stress and drug related mental condition was relied upon in mitigation. His Honour was entitled to take this into account and clearly did so.  
     
      
    29    As to the 7th matter, the absence of criminal history, this was a matter of little significance, having regard to the multiplicity of the offences committed by the respondent. 
     
      
    30    In relation to the 2nd and 6th matters, his Honour had said in an earlier part of his reasons:- 
     
      
       
        
        I accept that there is a strong element of contrition. The community has eventually been saved the enormous cost of a trial that might have lasted several months if strict proof was required. Furthermore, the embarrassment of those victims defrauded, by reliving those events of 1989 to 1992 in a public trial, has been avoided. 
        
       
       
        
        On my findings the prisoner is entitled to the fullest discount by his plea of guilty in 1999, and for his approach to proof of matters throughout the history of the proceedings."" 
        
       
      
    31    It is the Crown's submission that his Honour was mistaken in finding that the plea entitled the respondent ""to the fullest discount"". I consider that the Crown is correct in this submission. Although it was clearly open to his Honour to find that the respondent had shown a level of contrition in his ready co-operation with the Law Society investigation, once it had been triggered by a client's complaint, he had, nevertheless, refused to accept full criminal responsibility for his actions in the police investigations. Although he waived his right to committal proceedings, he did not do so on the basis that he would plead guilty to the offences charged. He continued to assert a defence based upon his mental condition at the time of the misappropriations. The assertion of this defence, which was not finally abandoned until 1999, obviously involved the prosecution in the obtaining of evidence necessary to rebut it. This would include expert medical and pharmacological evidence. There was, apparently, unnecessary delay in obtaining this. Even so, the respondent's failure to plead guilty when charged in 1994 necessarily involved the prosecution in the obtaining of this evidence. In these circumstances, it would not, in my view, be correct to hold that the respondent was entitled to ""the fullest discount"". That would have been appropriate only if he had pleaded guilty at the outset.  
     
      
    32    However, I agree, with respect, that the respondent was entitled to discount ""for his approach to proof of matters throughout the history of the proceedings."" It is plain that the respondent, whilst maintaining a defence based loosely on absence of mens rea, sought to facilitate the proof against him of other aspects of the case. He did not wish his ex clients to be embarrassed by providing and giving evidence. He was clearly prepared to admit and facilitate the admission of all factual matters bearing upon the defalcations. Of course, even in this situation, it might well have been necessary for the Crown to call some evidence as to the dealings with individual clients on the issue of respondent's mental condition at the time. Nevertheless, the respondent's attitude had obvious utilitarian value in the rationalising and general reduction in complexity of the proceedings. When this is taken with his ultimate plea of guilty, after a period of delay for which the Crown had to accept significant responsibility, a discount of reasonable size, on utilitarian grounds, would be appropriate.  
     
      
    33    Leaving aside the question whether the respondent's original attitude coupled with his final plea could be taken as evidence, in themselves of contrition, there was ample additional evidence in the case before his Honour to indicate a high level of remorse and contrition. His Honour was clearly entitled to give considerable weight to this when considering the appropriate sentence. In the upshot, although I consider that error has been demonstrated in his Honour's approach to the plea of guilty, I am of the view that little weight should be attributed to it in this appeal. 
     
      
    34    The 3rd, 9th and 10th matters are related and can be considered together. It is the Crown's contention that his Honour over-emphasised them in favour of the respondent. They arise because of the delay in the finalisation of the proceedings. It is clear that in the period from committal to sentence, the respondent has taken significant steps towards his rehabilitation. As already indicated, he had solved his domestic problems and ceased the taking of drugs in harmful quantities. Although being unable to practise as a solicitor he had been able to make his legal skills available in other areas of service to the community. As his Honour found the respondent was employed by a New South Wales Government organisation known as Community Housing Mid-North Coast (the Organisation). He had assisted in the incorporation of this organisation on 24 July 1996. Since then it had grown in size and scope. Government funding had increased substantially, enabling the purchase of more properties with the result that, at the time of trial, the number of properties administered was 426, covering general housing, supported housing, youth housing and crisis accommodation, allowing 1,000 persons to be housed. The area of the organisation's administration covered Coffs Harbour, Nambucca and Bellingen and the annual turn-over subject to the association's administration was $2.66 million.  
     
      
    35    His Honour accepted as correct the following passage from the respondent's written statement (Exhibit 1):- 
     
      
       
        
        ""I have recently been upgraded to full-time Administrator of the Association in view of the greatly increased work pressures, and it remains my function to co-ordinate this growth and receive and distribute the funding involved, as well as generally to administer and resource the group and continue to negotiate for additional growth. There remains an acute shortage of affordable housing on the mid north coast, which we need to continually address. With the appointment as Administrator, I have, of necessity, become increasingly involved in sector-wide issues generally ranging from staff issues, such as fringe benefit tax exemption and working conditions, to submissions on the Government budget strategy and the future directions of Community Housing. I have for some time been one or three Community Housing representatives on the Regional Community Housing Forum in the northern region, and more recently have been appointed as that Forum's delegate on the Northern Region Housing Advisory Committee, which is charged with planning the development of public and community housing in the northern region, to be included in the State housing assistance plans."" 
        
       
      
    36    The result of the respondent's appointment to the position of full-time administrator had been that he was now in receipt of income sufficient to finance the level of reparation which formed part of his Honour's order. 
     
      
    37    His Honour also received evidence from reputable persons associated with the Organisation indicating the substantial efforts made by the respondent in furthering its work and of his general value to the Organisation. It also appeared from the evidence that, prior to his appointment to paid employment, the respondent had devoted very many unpaid hours of work to the Organisation.  
     
      
    38    It is clear that his Honour placed considerable weight upon this aspect of the respondent's case and sought, in the sentence imposed to achieve a situation whereby the respondent could continue in this work and, at the same time, achieve a source of income from which worthwhile payments could be made to defray his defalcations. 
     
      
    39    It is the Crown's contention that his Honour in considering this aspect of the case was unduly favourable to the respondent. It is submitted that his Honour failed to have regard to the very serious criminality involved in the multiple misappropriations and the fraudulent steps taken by the respondent to cover them up. These matters were of such a serious nature that they could not be outweighed by the credit that could be given to the respondent for what he had achieved during the period of long delay between committal and sentence and the other mitigating factors in the case. 
     
      
    40    It is clear from his Honour's careful judgment that he gave full consideration to all matters relevant to sentencing in the case. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The question for me is should I, in recognising the equation of punishment, deterrence and rehabilitation, allow the prisoner to continue his rehabilitation and contrition to the community, or impose upon him a full custodial sentence? This latter approach is backed by precedent, and justified by the principle of general deterrence…. Properly, prosecution Counsel emphasised on behalf of the community that a full-time custodial sentence should be imposed. The Court would not expect otherwise. But, just as there are good reasons for imposing on tax and Social Security cheats a full custodial sentence, because they are easy to commit but hard to detect, so there are always cases where, on balancing all the factors, it is more appropriate to impose a lesser punishment than full-time custody. This case is one of them."" 
        
       
      
    41    After considerable hesitation, occasioned by the objective gravity of the respondent's offences, I have come to the conclusion that his Honour's sentence should not be disturbed. In so doing, I have been influenced, as was his Honour, by the extensive period of delay which occurred, during which the respondent has significantly rehabilitated himself and become a useful member of society. In R v Todd, (1982) 2 NSWLR 517 Street CJ (at 519-520) spoke of the fact ""that sentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, calls for a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach - passage of time between events and sentence, when lengthy, will often lead to considerations of fairness to the prisoner in his present situation playing a dominant role in the determination of what should be done in the matter of sentence; at times this can require what might otherwise be a quite undue degree of leniency being extended to the prisoner."" The statement was made in the context of a prisoner's having achieved significant rehabilitation during the period of delay.  
     
      
    42    In the recent case of Director of Public Prosecutions v Hamman, CCA unreported 1 December 1998, the above passage from Todd was cited with approval, the Court referring (at p. 50) ""to a lengthy postponement before sentence and the need in fairness to give weight to the progress of rehabilitation during this time and to the circumstance that the person concerned had been left in a state of uncertain suspense as to what would happen.""  
     
      
    43    It may be noted that the respondent has already served a not inconsiderable part of the sentence of periodic detention imposed by Twigg DCJ. I am not persuaded that his Honour's sentence should be disturbed in any way. Consequently, I would propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    44    There is an application for leave to appeal on behalf of the respondent. It is based purely on the circumstances that his Honour did not divide the period of three years imprisonment into minimum and additional terms. The overall structure of sentence was to impose a span of periodic imprisonment with a continuation thereafter of recognizance conditions. It is plain that there is no practicality in parole and recognizance running concurrently and it can be readily inferred that that is why the service of periodic detention over three years as a fixed term was ordered and the absence of expression of this is of no consequence. Leave to appeal should be refused.45 GROVE J: I agree with Foster AJA.46 B M JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of Foster AJA.

     JUDGMENT 
    1    STEIN JA: I agree with Dunford J. 
    2    DUNFORD J: These appeals, which were heard together, arise out of events at the Forster-Tuncurry Memorial Services Club (“the Club”) in the early hours of Sunday 23 February 1997. 
    3    The appellants were members of the Cambridge Park Rugby League Football team that was in Forster for a weekend football competition. Following the games played on Saturday 22 February 1997, a number of players from various teams including members of the Cambridge Park team attended the Club. 
    4    At the end of the evening, as a group of players said to be from the Cambridge Park team were leaving the Club there was a degree of rowdy behaviour and Mr Warren Woods, an employee of the Club, approached the group who were then located in the foyer with a view to subduing the rowdy members. He asked them to leave whereupon he was punched by a number of people, eventually falling to the ground. Whilst on the ground he was kicked several times, as a result of which he lost an eye and suffered other injuries. A fracas developed during which other staff members came to the assistance of Mr Woods, and other persons, including Mr Duncum, the club manager, were allegedly assaulted. 
    5    Following the fight, the appellant Leroy and one Corey Johnstone were taken into police custody and photographed, but were not charged at that time. Johnstone returned to Sydney shortly after being released, but Leroy and the appellant Graham, together with other members of the Cambridge Park team remained in the area to take part in the continuation of the football competition the following day. 
    6    Mr Jude, a casual employee of the Club who had witnessed the fracas, attended the football competition on the Sunday and took eight photographs (Ex. C) of various members of the Cambridge Park team including group photographs, under the guise that such photographs were being taken for inclusion in the local newspaper. He subsequently had these photographs developed along with those taken by the police of Leroy and Johnstone at the police station, and it was from the photographs taken by Mr Jude that a number of witnesses identified the appellants as persons involved in the events at the Club at the relevant time. The appellant Leroy was depicted in six of the eight photographs taken by Mr Jude, which were all group photographs, Johnstone was depicted in none as he had hastily left Forster the previous night, and the appellant Graham was depicted in four of the photographs. 
    7    The appellants were tried by a jury in the District Court at Taree before his Honour Judge Howie QC along with Grant Leslie Beard (Johnstone having obtained a separate trial) on the following charges: 
     
     Count 1: Leroy, Graham and Beard - affray 
      
     Count 2: Leroy and Graham - maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm upon Warren Woods 
      
     Count 3: Leroy - assault Darrell Duncum occasioning him actual bodily harm 
      
     Count 4: Leroy - assault Jason McCarthy occasioning him actual bodily harm 
      
     Count 5: Beard - assault Daniel Rosser occasioning him actual bodily harm 
      
      
    8    Beard was acquitted by direction in respect of both charges against him and Leroy was acquitted by direction on count 4 (assault on Jason McCarthy) because there was no evidence that the alleged assault on him had occasioned him any actual bodily harm, but the appellants were both found guilty on the other counts, and on 13 May 1999 they were sentenced as follows: 
     
     The appellant Leroy: 
      
     Count 1 
     : Fixed term of 6 months penal servitude to commence on 29/3/1999 and to expire on 28/9/1999. 
      
     Count 3 
     : Fixed term of 9 months penal servitude to commence on 29/9/1999 and to expire on 28/6/2000. 
      
     Count 2 
     : Minimum term of 2 years and 3 months penal servitude to commence on 29/6/2000 and to expire on 28/9/2002. 
      
     Additional term of 2 years to commence on 29/9/2002 and to expire on 28/9/2004. 
      
      
     The appellant Graham: 
      
     Count 1 
     : Fixed term of 3 months penal servitude to commence on 29/3/1999 and to expire on 28/6/1999. 
      
     Count 2 
     : Minimum term of 2 years and 9 months penal servitude to commence on 29/6/1999 and to expire on 28/3/2002. 
      
     Additional term of 18 months to commence on 29/3/2002 and to expire on 28/9/2003. 
      
      
    9    The grounds of appeal (as amended) relied on by the appellants were as follows:- 
     
     In the case of the appellant Leroy: 
      
      
     Ground 1 
     : His Honour erred in admitting the evidence of identification obtained by the use of photographs. 
      
     Ground 2A 
     : By reason of the matters particularised below there has been a miscarriage of justice in the trial of the appellant. 
      
     Particulars 
     : 
    · The admission of the evidence of witnesses who had viewed the photographs of the appellant resulted in the appellant not receiving a fair trial. 
     
     Ground 2B 
     : 
       
     The verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 
      
      
     In the case of the appellant Graham: 
      
      
     Ground 1 
     : The learned trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the fact that the following witnesses had previously identified the appellant from photographs: 
    i. Geoffrey John Drummond; andii. Michael John Smythe. 
     
     Ground 2A 
     : By reason of the matters particularised below there has been a miscarriage of justice in the trial of the appellant. 
      
     Particulars 
     : 
    · The admission of photographic identification evidence by the witnesses Smythe and Drummond resulted in the accused not receiving a fair trial;· The learned trial judge erred in that, having permitted the Crown to lead evidence of material contained in the police statement of the witness Stephen Stanford, dated 23 April, 1997: 
     
      
      i. his Honour refused to limit the use of such material under s 136 of the Evidence Act 1995 when requested to do so; and  
       
      ii. he instructed the jury that such material could be used by them as evidence of the fact that the appellant kicked a staff member on the floor and was pulled off by Mr Stanford. (SU p 46.7) 
      
     Ground 2B 
     : The verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 
      
      
     The appellant Graham also seeks leave to appeal against sentence on the following grounds: 
      
     Ground 1 
     : The sentences imposed by the learned sentencing judge are manifestly excessive. 
      
     Ground 2 
     : The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to fix an appropriately adjusted additional term in relation to the offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm after holding that special circumstances under s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act existed. 
      
     Ground 3 
     : 
       
     The learned sentencing judge erred in making the sentence for the offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm cumulative upon the sentence for the offence of affray. 
      
     Ground 4 
     : 
       
     The learned sentencing judge erred in effectively increasing the minimum term to be spent in custody by the appellant by failing to make the sentences upon the two offences concurrent. 
      
    10    In substance there are two issues in the conviction appeals: 
     
     (a) Whether the identification evidence ought to have been admitted at all, and  
      
     (b) Whether having regard to the alleged deficiencies in the identification evidence, there has been a miscarriage of justice in the sense that the verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence, or to use the language formerly in vogue, the verdicts are unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
      
    11    The trial commenced with an application on behalf of the appellants to exclude the identification evidence. Essentially the application was based on s 114 of the Evidence Act 1995 and upon the power to exclude unfairly prejudicial evidence (s 137). 
    12    As a result of the application a voir dire examination was held. Mr Jude, Det Sen Const Cahill, Ms Tunks, Det Carroll and Sgt Lee gave evidence concerning the process of identification. 
    13    I have already described the circumstances in which Mr Jude took the photographs and the identifications were subsequently made. Ms Tunks indicated that she had directed Mr Jude to take a photograph of Leroy but Mr Jude did not recall this occurring. These photos were then shown to twelve other persons who were at the Club at the time of the incident who marked on separate photocopies those persons they said where involved. Some months later police obtained photos of all the members of the Cambridge Park Football team and compiled them into an array which was also later shown to witnesses. 
    14    The officer in charge of the investigation (Det Cahill) said that he considered conducting an identification parade was impractical. He referred to the fact that there were thirteen potential witnesses, local people could be recognised, some of the suspects were not known by name until weeks later, and because of his size and physique, Leroy would be difficult to match in a fair array. 
    15    On 16 March 1999 his Honour determined that the evidence was admissible and indicated he would publish his reasons during the trial; which he did on 26 March.  
    16    In his judgment his Honour noted that counsel for each accused conceded that it was not reasonable to have expected the police to have attempted to hold an identification parade prior to Monday 24 February given the number of witnesses to be interviewed, the number of persons involved in the incident, the limited police resources and the time available. His Honour concluded that two witnesses, Mr Jude and Ms Tunks did not identify the appellants from photographs shown to them by police, but rather identified them at the football matches on the Sunday, and later confirmed their identification using the photographs taken by Mr Jude. In those circumstances there was no point in having them identify those persons in a line-up as there was the risk that they would then merely be identifying the person they saw at the football. His Honour also accepted the evidence of the police officer in charge of the investigation that it was in the circumstances, not reasonable to attempt an identification parade. In relation to Graham the evidence from Det Cahill was that he was unaware of his involvement until he was nominated from the photographs, and even then he remained unaware who he was until 8 March 1997. His Honour also refused to exclude the evidence under s 137. He observed that the photographs were a considerable improvement on the use of the photographs from police files and noted that none of the witnesses had given a description of the various persons involved prior to looking at the photographs, but said that this could adequately be covered by directions to the jury. 
    17    On the appeals, only Leroy relied on s 114 of the Evidence Act, although both appellants relied on s 137. Section 114(2) renders inadmissible, visual identification evidence adduced by the prosecution unless an identification parade has been held, or it would not have been reasonable to hold such a parade, or the defendant has refused to take part in a parade, whilst subs (3), without limiting the matters which may be taken into account in determining whether it was reasonable to hold an identification parade, specifies a number of matters to be taken into account including: 
     
     ( 
     a) the kind and gravity of the offence concerned, 
      
     (b) the importance of the evidence, 
      
     (c) the practicability of holding an identification parade having regard among other things to whether the identification was made at or about the time of the commission of the offence, 
      
     whilst subs (4) provides that it is presumed that it would not have been reasonable to hold an identification parade if it would have been unfair to the defendant for such a parade to have been held. 
      
    18    I agree with the learned trial judge in respect of the witnesses, Mr Jude and Ms Tunks. Those witnesses identified the appellant Leroy at the football matches on the Sunday afternoon and there was consequently no point in having an identification parade for them at a later time, as the objection could then be validly made that they may be picking out the person they recognised at the football rather than the person they saw involved in the fracas at the Club early on the Sunday morning. 
    19    As to the other witnesses, it was Monday before the police had any other suspects which they got from Mr Jude's photo identification and, apart from Johnstone and Leroy (in the case of Graham 8 March 2000), it was some further time before they had names for all such suspects, but by the Monday, they had all returned to the Penrith area. It would therefore have been necessary to transport all the witnesses to the Penrith area or, if they were willing to travel and willing to take part in an identification parade, to transport the suspects to Forster. Apart from the logistical difficulties it would therefore have taken considerable time to arrange an identification parade and it was, in my view, clearly preferable to have the identifications done promptly, albeit from photos, whilst the images of those involved were more likely to be fresh in the minds of the identifying witnesses, than to wait some weeks for an identification parade by which time the witnesses' memories of the images would probably not be so accurate. 
    20    The police also claimed that there would have been additional difficulties in holding an identification parade in the Forster/Tuncurry area because the alleged offenders were known to be ""out-of-towners"" and so the witnesses who might recognise local persons in the line-up would automatically exclude such persons. This problem I believe could have been overcome by including in the line-up persons from Taree or beyond; but the other objections referred to above are, in my opinion, valid; and it must be borne in mind that the touchstone in s 114(2)(b) is whether it would not have been ""reasonable"", not whether it would not have been ""possible"" to have held an identification parade. 
    21    The appellant Leroy's main complaint seems to be that he was not put in a identification parade with the alleged co-offender Johnstone whom it was claimed was of similar build and appearance, where witnesses might have been unable to distinguish between the two of them; but Johnstone had left town suddenly and presumably would not have been prepared to take part in an identification parade and, later on when invited to, in fact declined to do so; and as they were both suspects, it would have been appropriate to have separate identification parades for each of them. 
    22    The Crown case was not that it was Leroy or Johnstone that had been involved in the fracas and had assaulted Mr Woods, but that it was both of them. Johnstone had also been charged, but was granted a separate trial. 
    23    For these reasons I consider his Honour was correct in ruling that in the circumstances of this case it would not have been reasonable to hold an identification parade. 
    24    As to the application by each of the appellants to have the evidence excluded pursuant to s 137, that section, unlike the previous law, does not confer a discretion on the trial judge, but where the conditions of the section are satisfied, i.e. its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused, the judge must refuse to admit the evidence: R v Blick [2000] NSWCCA 61 at [20].  
    25    Both appellants complain in particular about the failure of the police to obtain descriptions of the alleged offenders promptly after the events of the Sunday morning and at least before they were shown the photographs. This has been described as of ""high importance"": R v Clout (1995) 41 NSWLR 312 at 321. See also R v (Kerrie) Clarke (1997) 97 A Crim R 414 at 430, R v Moody (CCA - 1 April 1997). 
    26    Early descriptions are important because they enable the tribunal of fact to test the identification made with the description given shortly after the event, and defence counsel are able to cross-examine and address on any discrepancies which may appear. Needless to say, any descriptions given after the witness has identified a suspect either from an identification parade or from photographs is useless as it is essentially a description of the person who has already been identified. However, in none of the cases referred to, and I am not aware of any others, was the conviction upset because the identification evidence had not been excluded by reason of the fact that no description of the alleged offender had been obtained from witnesses before identification was made. Clout involved the identification of a semi-trailer; in Clarke the judge had failed to give the warnings required by ss 116 and 165 and in Moody the conviction was found to be unsafe and unsatisfactory on the whole of the evidence, including not only the delay in obtaining descriptions, but also inconsistencies in such descriptions as were obtained. 
    27    His Honour took the view that this deficiency did not of itself compel exclusion of the identification evidence, but could be addressed by detailed directions to the jury on the subject, which directions he subsequently gave. 
    28    Various other objections were made as to how the identification evidence was unfairly prejudicial to the appellants. On behalf of Leroy objection was taken to the sequence of the photographs in Ex. C and the photocopies, it being suggested that photograph no. 1 shows him prominently at the left of the photo whereas most of the other players depicted in such photo were shorter and darker, and that he is shown in a higher proportion of the photos (in fact he is shown in four of them), and in this context also he relies again on the failure to hold an identification parade. 
    29    The appellant Graham relies on the submission that he is the only Aboriginal shown in the photographs and the only person with a goatee beard. In fact, there are at least one, and probably two, other persons of dark complexion consistent with being of the Aboriginal race and whilst Graham is the only one who has a goatee beard, it seems he was the only member of the Cambridge Park teams who had such a beard, its significance in the identification of the appellant did not become apparent until much later in the trial during the cross-examination of Mr Drummond.  
    30    We were again referred in this context to Blick, another case where only one person with a goatee beard was shown, but that case is clearly distinguishable in that a description had been obtained which included a reference to a goatee beard and when the collection of photographs was prepared for the witness to examine the suspect’s photo was the only one of a person with a goatee beard and it gave the impression of having been substantially cut down for the purpose of the identification examination, whereas here the photos were taken of different persons, they were not police mug shots, they were taken in casual surroundings, from different angles, they showed people in different postures (sitting, standing etc) and none of the photos suggested criminality. I have examined the original photos and do not consider that there is anything about them which would suggest to a prospective witness that any particular person or persons should be identified. 
    31    In the case of the appellant Graham he was not a suspect until the witnesses identified him from the photographs. Once this happened, there was the same danger that if an identification parade were held the witnesses would be identifying the person they had seen in the photographs rather than the person they had seen involved in the fracas at the Club early on Sunday morning. 
    32    At the time his Honour ruled on the admissibility of the identification evidence, he was also aware of two other pieces of evidence, namely a statement by the appellant Leroy made at the police station early on the morning of 23 February in which he said he was there in the melee but claimed he was trying to break up the fight; and that after a doorman hit him, he hit him back. This material placed him in the area at the relevant time. There was also a statement from Stephen Stanford, to which further reference will be made later. He was a member of one of the Cambridge Park teams and said that when shown photograph no. 6 he marked one of the guys who was ""kicking somebody"". He thought his name was ""Graham"". This was not evidence from a stranger but recognition by an acquaintance. In the trial he denied this evidence and was treated as an unfavourable witness, but that was later. 
    33    The identification evidence was not without its deficiencies, particularly in the failure of the police to obtain descriptions of the alleged offenders prior to the identification process, and accordingly the jury required careful directions and the appropriate warnings; which they subsequently received; but I am not satisfied that the probative value of such evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellants; and consequently it ought not to have been excluded by reason of s 137. Indeed the highly probative nature of such evidence will become apparent later in this judgment when I consider the grounds of appeal against conviction which in effect assert that the verdicts were unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 
    34    Before turning to that I should refer to a further ground contained in the written submissions on behalf of Graham, namely that the trial judge having permitted the Crown to lead evidence of the statement of the witness Stephen Stanford referred to above, refused to limit the use of such material under s 136 of the Evidence Act when requested to do so, and instructed the jury that such material could be used by them as evidence of the fact that the appellant kicked a staff member on the floor and was pulled off by Mr Stanford. 
    35    In the light of the judgment of this Court in R v Adam [1999] 47 NSWLR 267, Mr Greenhill SC did not press this ground. I understand that special leave to appeal has been granted by the High Court, but no date has yet been fixed for the hearing of such appeal. See also R v GAC (CCA - 1 April 1997). 
    36    I turn now to consider the submissions that the verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 
    37    Mr Warren Woods, the Club employee who told the group to leave at closing time, said there were a lot of people around him at that time, and that there was a ""big bloke"" who was in front of him, waving his hand in front of his face and pretending to head butt him two or four times, stopping about six inches from his face. He told him to ""rack off"" but the person was laughing at him. He said the person in front of him was three to four inches taller than he was and described him as having ""short, blonde hair, short cropped sort of hair"". He said he received a punch to the head and then a lot of punches, he covered himself up and then there were blows coming from everywhere. He remembered next that he was on the ground being kicked. He lost one of his eyes, the floor of his orbital was fractured, he said that his neurologist had told him that he had about 25% brain damage to memory retention. On 25 February he marked Leroy's photographs from those taken by Mr Jude and said that he was pretty sure that that was the person who was head butting and moving his hands in front of his face. He also marked Graham’s photographs, and said he remembered him being in the foyer, and he was worried about him, but he did not see him hit anybody. 
    38    Darrell Duncum, another employee of the Club, gave evidence that he had heard Warren Woods asking ""a large chap"" to finish his drink and not take any outside but that such person started arguing with Mr Woods. He then saw him head butt Mr Woods and start to hit him. He ran down to grab that person by pushing him out towards the front doors but at that time he was bashed and kicked by other people in the same group. He said there was another large chap who was standing in front of him, challenging him to a fight, which he declined. He described that person as six foot or more with very short spiky blonde coloured hair. He said that person hit him in the face and he was bleeding, his jaw was cracked and eleven of his teeth were broken. He denied offering his assailant any violence. After that he saw that person challenge his colleague Jason McCarthy and saw him leaning forward and head butting McCarthy. On 26 February he marked the appellant Leroy's photograph as the person who had punched him in the face and head butted McCarthy.  
    39    Jason McCarthy said that he saw a large crowd of patrons and a few of the security guys in what appeared to be a scuffle, he went over to assist a colleague, Mick Smythe, who was in a scuffle with a ""large guy"", whom he described as being around six foot with short hair. That person challenged him and put his fists up but McCarthy put his hands above his head as the person tried to head butt him. He said that he went to the football field on the Sunday and saw some of the people from the Cambridge Park team who had been at the Club the previous night, including the person who had head butted him there and on 26 February went to the police station and examined the photos taken by Mr Jude. He said the person who tried to head butt him looked like the appellant Leroy.  
    40    Mr Jude said that he saw Mr Darrell Duncum being punched to the right side of the head by a tall well built short cropped blonde person whilst he was standing there with his hands by his side. He described going to the football field the following day and taking photos of the Cambridge Park team and he later identified the appellant Leroy in the photos as the person he saw hit Darrell Duncum. 
    41    Douglas Lawson, a security officer at the Club described the person who had punched Mr Duncum as a ""big solid chap probably six foot one, perhaps could have been a bit higher with stocky build and good footballing physique. He was distinctive as to his size"". He marked Leroy's photograph as the person who struck Mr Duncum. Later in his evidence he also said that this person was in the original melee, near Mr Woods in the foyer but he could not say exactly what he was doing, although he indicated that he was acting violently. 
    42    Michael Smythe, a barman/doorman said that he arrived at the Club after the fight was under way, he helped to move people outside and tried to stop others re-entering. He said that at that time Mr Woods had already been assaulted and was lying at the reception desk. He said he was confronted by two large men and struck by another. He gave the description of the man who struck Mr Duncan as six foot three, wearing a horizontally striped shirt with an emblem, with blond, cropped hair. Exibit D shows that on the evening in question, Leroy was wearing a horizontally striped shirt with an emblem and had blond cropped hair. On 24 February he went to the police station and identified persons from photographs. He said that it was the appellant Leroy who hit Mr Duncum just after he was hit. He also identified the appellant Graham's photograph of being of a person involved in a scuffle around Mr Duncum. He said he was wearing dark glasses and pushing and shoving and egging the others on to fight. He also described the person who charged him as having a grey polo shirt on and having dark hair, a description which Ex. 1 shows is consistent with being Corey Johnstone.  
    43    Ms Deborah Tunks, bar attendant gave evidence that she identified the appellant Leroy as the person who punched Warren Woods. She had seen him in the Club during the evening and had served him and had noted that he was so prominent that she could not forget him. He was probably the largest person there. She attended the football the following day and identified him at the game and asked Mr Jude to include him in the photos. She said that she spoke to him whilst he was at the bar. 
    44    Ms Unger said she saw the attack upon Mr Woods after it commenced, at the time he was being kicked near the reception desk but she could not identify anyone involved in that incident. She did identify the photo of the appellant Leroy as the person she saw hitting Mr Woods and other staff members, including Mr Smythe, Mr Duncum and Mr Rosser but there is no suggestion that Mr Leroy ever struck Mr Rosser and the jury were invited to view her evidence with some scepticism.  
    45    Geoffrey Drummond said that he saw the whole incident involving Mr Woods from its commencement to its conclusion. He intervened to help pull persons off Mr Woods and was himself thrown at one stage to the wall near a super draw bin but he went back again to assist Mr Woods and saw him at the reception desk being kicked by four persons whom he believed were part of the original group. He wrestled and jostled with such persons as he tried to get help for Mr Woods. He said staff were trying to eject people through the front door and whilst that was happening he saw two persons come back into the Club and kick Mr Woods again as he was lying at the reception desk. On 25 February he attended the police station and was shown the photographs taken by Mr Jude. He identified Mr Leroy in three of the photographs as being one of the persons punching Mr Woods at the outset of the attack upon him and he chose Mr Graham as one of the persons who ran back from the air lock to kick Mr Woods and he saw him kick him on two occasions.  
    46    Stephen Stanford, previously referred to, was a member of the Cambridge Park A-grade team. He had known Johnstone and Leroy for some time and he also knew Colin Graham, but not for very long. He gave evidence that he was at the Club on the night in question and was pretty drunk but he saw some of the staff members punching Corey Johnstone and Johnstone retaliating. He also punched someone himself, and as a result was charged by police in relation to that and dealt with by the Court. He said he could not remember Colin Graham being in the foyer at the time but his Honour gave leave to the Crown to cross-examine him pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act on the basis of the statement he made to police on 23 April 1997 and he agreed that that statement signed by him contained the following passages: 
     
      
       
       ""The fight turned into a thing where people started to break it up by pulling people away. I saw a couple of the C-graders kicking one of the staff. I don't know which staff member. 
        
       I was shown photograph no. 6. I marked one of the guys. I think his name was Graham. He was one of the C-graders who I pulled off and was kicking somebody."" 
       
      
      
     The contents of the statement therefore became evidence of the facts and was relied upon by the Crown as evidence against Graham. Detective Carol gave evidence that he had seen the witness mark the relevant photograph as identifying the appellant Graham.  
      
    47    In a recorded interview with police on 8 March 1997 and in his evidence at the trial, the appellant Leroy denied head butting Mr McCarthy but admitted he punched Mr Duncum although claiming he did so in self defence, and in his recorded interview and in his evidence at the trial, the appellant Graham admitted that he was in the vicinity of the incident but denied being a participant in any attack upon any club staff members. 
    48    There was accordingly positive identification of the appellant Leroy as being involved in the affray (count 1) from Jude, Smythe, Lawson, Duncum, Woods and McCarthy. In addition Deborah Tunks identified the appellant Leroy as a person who punched Mr Warren Woods and so did Mr Drummond (count 2), whilst Duncum, Jude, Lawson and Drummond identified him as punching Duncum (count 3); but perhaps the most telling evidence against this appellant was his own. He admitted that he punched Mr Duncum but claimed that he did it in self defence. The jury by its verdict rejected his assertion that he did it in self defence, so on his own admission he was clearly guilty of assaulting Duncum, and in view of the injuries suffered by Duncum this was sufficient to convict him of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. That evidence of itself was also sufficient to implicate him in the affray. It was well open to the jury to be satisfied of his guilt on all 3 counts. 
    49    As regards the appellant Graham there was direct evidence from Mr Drummond identifying him as the person who was kicking Mr Warren Woods whilst he was on the ground (count 2). There was also the evidence of Mr Stanford, and the jury were entitled to act on what appeared in his statement as confirming the evidence of Mr Drummond to that effect, and Douglas Lawson identified him as one of the persons whom he “believed” was involved in punching and kicking Mr Woods when he was on the ground. In addition there was evidence from Mr Woods and Mr Smythe that Graham was in the area and involved in the affray. In my view it was open to the jury acting reasonably to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt on counts 1 and 2. For these reasons I am of the view that both appeals against conviction should be dismissed.  
    50    In relation to the application by Graham for leave to appeal against sentence, his Honour so structured the sentences imposed so that he is to serve a total minimum term of 2 years and 9 months with an additional term of 18 months, having found that there were “special circumstances” within the meaning of s 5(2) Sentencing Act 1995.  
    51    The applicant Graham was born on 31 July 1978 so he was 18½ at the time of the offences. He had prior findings of guilt for high range PCA, break and enter with intent and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He is of Aboriginal descent. His parents separated when he was very young and he was raised by his mother but continued to have regular contact with his father. He left school after completing his school certificate at the age of 16 years and was doing an apprenticeship as a brick layer until his employer's business closed, since when he had been employed as a storeman for 12 months, and his employer indicated that he was well respected and highly thought of. He was supported by a number of references attesting to his good character and reliability. He agrees that he had been drinking excessively on the night of the incident and was affected.  
    52    The main thrust of Mr Greenhill's submissions was that the sentences should not have been made cumulative, and that the additional terms should have been 2 years instead of 18 months with a corresponding reduction in the minimum term. I am not persuaded by either of these submissions. In my view, having regard to the judgments of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57 and acknowledging the principle of totality, this was an appropriate case to impose cumulative sentences. The appellant Graham was not only involved in the assault on Mr Woods but was also involved in the general affray using violence and threatening persons at the scene to fear for their personal safety, and to have made the sentences concurrent would have resulted in fact in no sentence being imposed for the affray. In regard to the sentence for maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm it needs to be borne in mind that this was a very serious offence, kicking a person when he is on the ground, particularly when acting in concert with others. People have died from such attacks and the ferocity of the attack can be seen from Mr Woods injuries, namely the loss of one of his eyes, the fractured bones and 25% brain damage to memory retention.  
    53    Notwithstanding the applicant’s previous good character (although he did have one prior conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm), his youth and the references furnished, I am not persuaded that the sentences imposed were outside the range of a proper sentencing discretion. We were invited to adjust the relationship between the minimum and additional terms by reducing the minimum term by 6 months and adding the corresponding amount to the additional term, but this would merely be fiddling with the sentence, and that is not the function of this Court. There is no application for leave to appeal against sentence in the case of Leroy.  
    54    In my opinion both appeals against conviction should be dismissed. The appellant Graham should have leave to appeal against the sentences imposed, but such appeal should also be dismissed. 
    55    SIMPSON J: I agree with the orders proposed by Dunford J and with his Honour's reasons.

       REGINA v David John THOMSON 
        
       REGINA v Edward Joseph Curtis HOULTON 
       
       
      Section 22 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
       1999 requires a sentencing judge to take into account the fact that an offender has pleaded guilty and when the offender pleaded guilty or indicated an intention to plead guilty. This reflects the longstanding practice of providing a sentence discount for a guilty plea. 
       
       
      The Crown asked the Court to promulgate a guideline judgment with respect to the discount for a plea of guilty in relation to State offences. 
       
       
      Need for a guideline judgment 
       
       
      On the material before the Court the objective of encouraging guilty pleas, especially early guilty pleas, is not being attained. A greater degree of transparency in the sentencing process is required to meet this objective. 
       
       
      Guideline 
       
       
      The following guideline is adopted: 
       
       
      (i) A sentencing judge should explicitly state that a plea of guilty has been taken into account. Failure to do so will generally be taken to indicate that the plea was not given weight. 
       
       
      (ii) Sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence insofar as they believe it appropriate to do so. This effect can encompass any or all of the matters to which the plea may be relevant - contrition, witness vulnerability and utilitarian value - but particular encouragement is given to the quantification of the last mentioned matter. Where other matters are regarded as appropriate to be quantified in a particular case, e.g. assistance to authorities, a single combined quantification will often be appropriate. 
       
       
      (iii) The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 percent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea. What is to be regarded as an early plea will vary according to the circumstances of the case and is a matter for determination by the sentencing judge. 
       
       
      (iv) In some cases the plea, in combination with other relevant factors, will change the nature of the sentence imposed. In some cases a plea will not lead to any discount.

       REGINA v Edward Joseph Curtis HOULTON 
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
        
        
       
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ:  The Crown asks the Court to promulgate a guideline judgment with respect to the discount for a plea of guilty, applicable to State offences generally. The Attorney General of New South Wales has intervened to make submissions to the same effect. The Public Defender was given leave by the Court to intervene and also made submissions generally supportive of a guideline judgment, though not in the same form contended for by the Crown and the Attorney. 
     
      
    2    As is the Court’s practice with respect to guideline judgments, a number of cases raising the relevant issue were listed and heard together. The Court gave judgment in two of the cases without awaiting formulation of a guideline judgment. (R v Ramos [2000] NSWCCA 189 and R v Carrion [2000] NSWCCA 191. Judgment in the other two cases will be delivered simultaneously with this judgment R v Thomson [2000] NSWCCA 294; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 183). 
     
      
    3    It has long been the practice of this Court that a plea of guilty should attract a lower sentence than would otherwise be imposed. Three reasons are usually advanced to justify the practice. First, the plea is a manifestation of remorse or contrition. Secondly, the plea has a utilitarian value to the efficiency of the criminal justice system. Thirdly, in particular cases - especially sexual assault cases, crimes involving children and, often, elderly victims - there is a particular value in avoiding the need to call witnesses, especially victims, to give evidence. 
     
      
    4    In Siganto v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 656 in a joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ the High Court validated the long standing practice of this and other courts, when their Honours said at [22]-[23]: 
     
      
       
        
        “A person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to plead not guilty, and defend himself or herself, without thereby attracting the risk of the imposition of a penalty more serious than would otherwise have been imposed. On the other hand, a plea of guilty is ordinarily a matter to be taken into account in mitigation; first, because it is usually evidence of some remorse on the part of the offender, and second, on the pragmatic ground that the community is spared the expense of a contested trial. The extent of the mitigation may vary depending on the circumstances of the case. It is also sometimes relevant to the aspect of remorse that a victim has been spared the necessity of undergoing the painful procedure of giving evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        … It is proper for a sentencing judge to observe, in a particular case, that circumstances which might otherwise attract leniency are absent. A trial judge’s reference to the absence from the case of a matter of mitigation does not mean that the judge is indicating the presence of a circumstance of aggravation …” 
        
       
      
    5    The distinction between not increasing a sentence by reason of a plea of not guilty and granting of leniency by means of a discount from a plea of guilty has not always been regarded as acceptable. (See the cases considered in R v JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209 at [16]-[22]). Siganto affirms the significance and validity of the distinction. 
     
      
    6    In 1990 the New South Wales Parliament introduced s439 into the Crimes Act 1900. This section has now been re-enacted, in substantially the same form, as s22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “22(1) In passing sentence for an offence on an offender who has pleaded guilty to the offence, a court must take into account: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the fact that the offender has pleaded guilty, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) when the offender pleaded guilty or indicated an intention to plead guilty, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        and may accordingly impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise have imposed. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) When passing sentence on such an offender, a court that does not impose a lesser penalty under this section must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, its reasons for not doing so. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Subsection (2) does not limit any other requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The failure of a court to comply with this section does not invalidate any sentence imposed by the court.” 
        
       
      
    7    In the course of the Second Reading Speech introducing s439 into the Crimes Act, the then Attorney General, now Dowd J, said (Hansard Parliament of New South Wales Legislative Assembly 4 April 1990 at 1689): 
     
      
       
        
        “The aim of this bill is to provide appropriate encouragements to those who are guilty of an offence to plead guilty to that offence. A substantial amount of the time of the courts in this State is taken up in determining the guilt or otherwise of those who plead not guilty. As far less time is involved in sentencing a person than in determining their guilt, even a minor change in a guilty plea rate has a significant effect on court time required. The guilty plea rate would therefore free up court time to deal with the backlog of cases awaiting hearing. I hasten to add that it is not intended that anyone who is not guilty should plead guilty. That is a fairly rare occurrence among people who turn up at court. This is one reason that there should be appropriate encouragements for those who are guilty to plead guilty. Another, equally important reason is that a plea of guilty results in significant benefits to people involved in the criminal justice system. One example of these benefits is that witnesses avoid the often distressing experience of giving evidence. Another is the police are not tied up in court for the length of a trial. 
        
       
       
        
        The earlier an offender pleads guilty, the greater the benefits for the courts, victims, witnesses, police and others. Accordingly, this bill provides not only encouragement to plead guilty but also encouragement to indicate a guilty plea to the court as early as possible.” 
        
       
      
    8    The Attorney went on to say at 1689-1690: 
     
      
       
        
        “Under the bill the court will not only be able to reduce the quantity of any sentence it would have imposed but for the guilty plea, it will also be able to reduce the severity of the sentence by imposing a sentence of a different nature. For example, a person who would have gone to prison for a full-time period of custody may receive a sentence of periodic detention because of an admission of guilt. Of course, the sentencing court will, as it does now, take care to ensure that a plea of guilty is appropriate in the circumstances. This will ensure that innocent people will not be pressured into pleading guilty. Experienced magistrates have shown that pleas of guilty are not automatically accepted when it is clear that the facts do not support the charge or there is some defect in the charge. There are some cases in which it would be inappropriate to reduce a sentence because of a plea of guilty. It is impossible to predict what sort of cases these will be but one example is where the offence is so serious that it is appropriate for the maximum sentence to be imposed despite a plea of guilty.” 
        
       
      
    9    The Attorney concluded at 1690: 
     
      
       
        
        “If a court refuses to reduce a sentence it must give reasons for doing so. This reflects the intention of the amendments that a reduction will usually be given. The new provision is not intended to intimidate the bench. The bench has to make such decisions all the time. Reductions will be made in some circumstances and not in others. Even where the Crown case is strong and a guilty plea may be thought to be inevitable, it will usually be appropriate to reduce the sentence to take account of the plea of guilty because the State has been saved the expense of a trial, witnesses have been spared the necessity of attending court and giving evidence, and police have been able to better carry out their duty of protecting the community.”  
        
       
      
    10    The conflicting policy issues are highlighted in this Second Reading Speech. The courts in New South Wales have a statutory duty to address the question of reducing a penalty - whether by way of discount or by stepping down the hierarchy of severity of sentencing options. The reference in s22(1)(b) to an obligation to take into account “when the offender pleaded guilty” is to be construed as indicating that the earlier a plea is made or indicated, the greater the claim that an offender has to the exercise in his or her favour of the discretion to which the Act refers. 
     
      
    11    The appropriateness of a discount for a plea of guilty is reflected in legislation of all Australian jurisdictions, apart from Tasmania: Criminal Law (Sentencing) Act 1988 (SA) s10(g); Sentencing Act 1995 (WA) s8(2); Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic) s5(2)(e); Penalties and Sentences Act 1992 (Qld) s13; Sentencing Act (NT) s5(2)(j); Crimes Act 1900 (ACT) s429A(1)(u); Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) s16A(2)(g). 
     
      
    12    Section 22 of the New South Wales Act must, of course, be implemented by New South Wales courts. Nevertheless, there are limits to the pursuit of the public interest sought to be served by this section. Some parts of the community, like Aboriginal accused, may be particularly vulnerable to inappropriate pressures to plead guilty. A sizeable discount for a plea may increase such pressures. None of the parties appearing in these proceedings suggested that this was a matter of substantial concern in the practical administration of criminal justice in New South Wales. Nevertheless, it is a matter to which a court may need to be sensitive when leave is sought to withdraw a plea or an appeal is brought, notwithstanding a plea. 
     
      
    13    The general principle is well established. The issue before the Court is whether or not, in accordance with the current practice of the Court with respect to guideline judgments, the Court should provide guidance, including guidance of a quantitative character with respect to the size of the appropriate discount. Prior to the development of the system of guideline judgments, this Court has refused to issue guidance of a quantitative character with respect to this matter.  
     
      
    14    In R v Winchester (1992) 58 A Crim R 345 Hunt CJ at CL said at 350: 
     
      
       
        
        “A plea of guilty is always a matter which must be taken into account when imposing sentence. The degree of leniency to be afforded will depend upon many different factors. The plea may in some cases be an indication of contrition, or of some other quality or attribute, which is regarded as relevant for sentencing purposes independently of the mere fact that the prisoner has pleaded guilty. The extent to which leniency will be afforded upon this ground will depend to a large degree upon whether or not the plea resulted from the recognition of the inevitable:  
        Shannon  
         (1979) 21 SASR 442 at 452;  
        Ellis 
         (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604. The plea of guilty may also be taken into account as a factor in its own right independently of such contrition, as mitigation for the co-operation in saving the time and cost involved in a trial. Obviously enough, the extent to which leniency will be afforded upon this ground will depend to a large degree upon just when the plea of guilty was entered or indicated (and thus the savings effected):  
        Beavan 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, Hunt, Badgery-Parker and Abadee JJ, 22 August 1991), at p 12. 
        
       
       
        
        The important point to be made is that leniency is afforded upon the second ground as a result of purely utilitarian considerations, as with the ‘discount’ allowed for assistance given to the authorities:  
        Cartwright 
         (1989) 17 NSWLR 243;  
        Gallagher 
         (1991) 23 NSWLR 220; 53 A Crim R 248. The leniency is afforded in order to encourage early pleas of guilty so that the criminal list is more expeditiously disposed of and so that other cases, in which there is a genuine issue to be determined, will be brought on for hearing without delay. 
        
       
       
        
        Encouragement will be given to early pleas of guilty only if they lead (and are seen to lead) to a substantial reduction in the sentence imposed. That does not mean that the sentencing judge should show a precisely quantified or quantifiable period or percentage as having been allowed. Indeed, it is better that it not be shown; that was the point of this Court’s decision in  
        Beavan 
         at pp14-15. As was said in that case - discounts for assistance given to the authorities to one side - it is both unnecessary and often unwise for the judge to identify the sentence which he or she regards as appropriate to the particular case without reference to one factor and then to identify the allowance made which is thought to be appropriate to that particular factor.” 
        
       
      
    15    The issue before the Court in these proceedings is whether or not the Court should maintain the approach reflected in this judgment in the light of the material now before the Court and the practice of the Court with respect to guideline judgments as established in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. 
     
      
    16    The submissions made to the Court proposed guidance of the following character: 
     
      
       
      (i) The Court should encourage trial judges to expressly address and quantify the effect of a guilty plea upon the sentence they imposed. 
       
       
      (ii) The Court, whilst acknowledging that there would be circumstances in which a plea would lead to a different sentencing option, should indicate a percentage range of discount for a plea of guilty. 
       
       
      (iii) Specific regard should be paid to the benefit of an early plea, perhaps by way of a graduated percentage, reducing the later the plea. 
       
       
      (iv) The Crown and the Attorney submitted that the discount range should encompass all considerations involved in the plea, namely: witness vulnerability and utilitarian aspects. The Public Defender, and other defence counsel, submitted that the discount should relate only to the utilitarian aspects. 
       
       
      Need for a Guideline Judgment 
       
      
    17    The basic proposition advanced in this Court in favour of the promulgation of a guideline judgment was that the objective designed to be attained by the longstanding practice, and by the express statutory provision, now found in s22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, was not being attained. Counsel appearing in these proceedings for the Crown, for the Attorney General, for the Public Defender and counsel for some of the individual Respondents, all indicated to the Court that there was significant doubt amongst practitioners that a substantial discount was in fact given by all sentencing judges and that there was particular scepticism as to whether an early plea was being appropriately recognised.  
     
      
    18    The collective experience of counsel appearing in these proceedings, together with that of those who instruct them, is entitled to considerable weight. The doubts expressed in this Court are undoubtedly manifest in the advice given to accused on a daily basis throughout the criminal justice system as to the benefit of pleading guilty and, particularly, the benefit of doing so at an early stage. The unanimity of the view expressed is itself a sound basis for this Court to act. 
     
      
    19    Furthermore, the Court had before it a research study undertaken by the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research which provided a body of relevant information. (Weatherburn and Baker Managing Trial Court Delay: An Analysis of Trial Case Processing in the NSW District Criminal Court New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (2000)). This study included a survey of defence representatives in every matter committed for trial in the New South Wales District Criminal Court and listed over a two month period in 1999, in the course of which a guilty plea was entered. The response to the survey was such as to encompass approximately 42 percent of all guilty pleas entered in matters committed for trial during the survey period.  
     
      
    20    Defence representatives were asked to give reasons for late entry of guilty pleas. The first four reasons were: late decision by the Crown to accept a plea to a lesser charge; defence being unable to discuss the matter with the Crown; defence difficulties in getting firm instructions; and, the client changing instructions just before the trial. However, the fifth most highly rated reason for late pleas, identified by defence counsel in this survey, was that there was no clear sentence benefit to the client in pleading any earlier. These five most frequently advanced reasons for a late change of plea, including lack of perceived sentence benefit, appear to apply irrespective of offence type or court location or bail status or other characteristics. This study is particularly valuable in informing the Court that there is a widespread perception of an absence of benefit from entering a plea at an early stage of the proceedings. 
     
      
    21    This perception is manifest in the result of the study that 60 percent of all guilty please are only entered on the day of the trial. There is every reason to believe that a significant proportion of those pleas could have been entered earlier. A number of interconnected reasons are advanced to explain this phenomenon. One is the perception of absence of benefit from an early plea. 
     
      
    22    The existence of widespread scepticism as to whether or not a guilty plea attracts a discount in practice, particularly whether or not an early plea attracts an additional benefit, confirms the study conducted by the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration at the request of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (Mack and Anleu Pleading Guilty: Issues and Practices AIJA (1995)). The authors of that study conducted interviews with prosecutors and defence lawyers in a number of States. The responses suggested that many accepted that a plea did give rise to a discount and that an early plea gave rise to a higher discount, but there was a considerable degree of scepticism indicated as to whether in practice this actually occurred.  
     
      
    23    The study noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “They observe that there is often a quantum of discount for an early guilty plea, but most qualified their comments by indicating that the discount exists ‘in theory’, ‘in the appeal books’, or in the words of a legal aid lawyer: ‘it’s supposed to be a third … the judge would actually say look I was going to give you six [years imprisonment] but I’m going to give you four. You wonder whether he would’ve given him six, but that’s what they say’. And another legal aid lawyer says: ‘I haven’t found, by running to trial that, the sentence goes up very much.’ Only in South Australia is there a move towards judges explicitly quantifying the actual amount of any discount given.” (p34) 
        
       
       
        
        “In our interviews, the general view was that the expected reduction in most jurisdictions is about 25-30%, though it can be higher, as much as 40-50% in some circumstances. However, there was substantial scepticism as to how much, if any, discount was actually given in a particular case, because of the practice of not stating the actual amount.” (p164) 
        
       
       
        
        “A clear statement of the amount of the discount is necessary, otherwise the accused is left to wonder whether the benefit which was the inducement for the plea was actually conferred. This concern was expressed very strongly in many of our interviews, and in UK research.” (p173) 
        
       
      
    24    The authors of this study did not support a discount for a plea, particularly a discount of any size. This is not a position that can be taken by this Court in the light of the statutory requirements to the contrary and long established authorities. The study does, however, confirm the existence of scepticism as to actual practice. 
     
      
    25    The Court was supplied with a number of statistics on sentencing outcomes for various offences from both the District Court and the Local Court, designed to establish that there was a pattern of inconsistency in sentencing after a guilty plea. Those statistics were presented in the form of the median sentence involving full time custody for a range of offences, comparing those in which there was a plea of guilty with those in which there was a plea of not guilty. With respect to a significant number of offences there was no apparent difference between the two categories. Indeed, in a number of cases, the median sentence for those pleading guilty was in fact greater than the median sentence for those pleading not guilty. 
     
      
    26    A similar analysis is contained in the report of the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research Managing Trial Court Delay at p37. That report suggests that the discount varies significantly amongst categories of offences and, in some cases, there is no discount. 
     
      
    27    The statistics presented in this respect are suggestive, but I have found it difficult to draw a conclusion that they establish any substantial degree of inconsistency amongst judges with respect to the weight given to a plea of guilty in the sentencing process. The statistics as presented take the entirety of the population sentenced for a specific offence and divide it into two categories: those who plead guilty and those who plead not guilty. In order to draw conclusions from a comparison between the treatment of these two groups, it is necessary to assume that the two groups did not differ between themselves with respect to other characteristics pertinent to the sentencing process. It does not appear to me that such an assumption is justified. 
     
      
    28    First, it appears to be quite likely that an accused with a significant criminal history is more likely to plead guilty than one without such history. This will distort the sentencing results because the prior history is a very pertinent matter, tending to increase the appropriate sentence in the case.  
     
      
    29    Secondly, the objective seriousness of the offences in the two categories cannot be assumed to be the same. In many instances guilty pleas occur in a context where the Crown accepts a plea to a lesser charge. It is often the case that the prosecution has put forward alternative charges of a lower degree of severity, in a context in which the facts are capable of making out an offence at different levels of gravity. In any such situation it is more likely that the objective circumstances of the offence will be at the highest level of gravity for the lesser charge. Accordingly, a plea of guilty to a lesser charge is likely to attract a higher level of penalty. The group of cases reflected in the not guilty pleas in the statistics presented to this Court, may be less likely to involve objective circumstances capable of satisfying a higher level of charge.  
     
      
    30    Thirdly, the statistics compare only those offenders who had been sentenced to full time custodial sentences. They make no allowance for the fact that in many cases other sentencing options could be, and were, chosen. It appears likely that the rate of imprisonment would be lower for those who plead guilty and, accordingly, the median terms of imprisonment for all of those sentenced for a particular offence after a plea will be higher than they would be if those who did plead guilty were as likely as those who pleaded not guilty to be sentenced to full time imprisonment. This lower instance of full time imprisonment after a guilty plea may have had a skewing effect. 
     
      
    31    Finally it is pertinent to note that with respect to many of the categories of offence presented to the Court, the number of people actually dealt with in the relevant periods was quite small, either generally or with respect to the number of sentences after a non guilty plea. 
     
      
    32    For these reasons the statistics relied on, whilst suggestive, cannot be regarded as establishing a pattern of inconsistency with respect to the allowance that should generally be made for pleading guilty.  
     
      
    33    I have, however, found to be useful the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research statistics which indicates that there is no benefit from an early plea. The kinds of differences to which I have referred above may explain why the two groups that plead guilty and not guilty are not equivalent in a number of respects which effect the ultimate sentence. It is more difficult to see why that should be so with respect to those who plead at committal distinguished from those who plead after committal. It may be that some are operative but not to the same extent as in the general case. Some reliance can be placed on these statistics. 
     
      
    34    The report of the Bureau does not make clear which offences are included in the various categories considered in the tables, nor the number of offences included in each category, nor the period covered by the tables. Nevertheless the results are revealing.Table 9: Severity of penalty by stage of plea  Plea at committal Plea after committal Difference (%) Median Median  Imprisonment prison Imprisonment prison Median rate sentence rate sentence Imprisonment prison (%) (months) (%) (months) rate sentenceSex 59 18 65 24 -9 -25 Drugs 68 30 55 25 +24 +20 Fraud 41 24 36 18 +14 +33 Robbery 74 22 80 21 -8 +5 Assault 55 24 38 14 +45 +71 Break and enter 72 12 73 16 -1 -25  
     
      
    35    The authors of the report explain this table in the following way at p37: 
     
      
       
        
        “It shows that, while there were some modest discounts given to accused who pleaded early over those pleading late, in most cases the penalties, in terms of the imprisonment rate and the median prison sentence, were a great deal harsher for accused pleading early than for accused pleading later. In the case of assault, the imprisonment rate was 45 per cent higher and the median prison sentence was 71 per cent higher for accused entering early pleas than for those entering late pleas. Again considerable variation in the discount was evident between offences.” 
        
       
      
    36    Accordingly the authors conclude at p38: 
     
      
       
        
        “This, then, is an area of law which would clearly benefit from reform. The statutory sentence discounts for guilty pleas obviously have an important role to play in encouraging  
        early 
         guilty pleas. However, there needs to be a significant discount for early guilty pleas and this needs to be applied consistently across different kinds of offences. … Note, however, that the benefits of an early guilty plea need to be clearly communicated to accused persons at an early stage (in terms which do not place the accused under undue pressure to plead guilty) if they are to achieve their intended purpose.” 
        
       
      
    37    This study is as good as can be made available, without an expensive and detailed research project. It strongly suggests that the degree of scepticism expressed in the interviews, and by counsel in these proceedings, as to whether or not an early plea attracts any benefit, is justified. This scepticism extends beyond the District Court considered in the study. 
     
      
    38    The material before the Court does not establish that, in general, a discount is not given for a plea of guilty or given inconsistently. It does however strongly suggest that there is doubt and, in any event considerable scepticism, as to the value of an early plea of guilty. This scepticism is undoubtedly reflected in the advice given to accuseds. This is of great significance for the achievement of the utilitarian objective designed to be served by the sentencing principle and by the statutory provision. It appears that a greater degree of transparency in the sentencing process is required if the objective of encouraging earlier pleas - reflected in s22(1)(b) of the Act - is to be attained. 
     
      
    39    The Crown submitted that a guideline judgment should be promulgated to change the practice and the perceptions in this respect, by: 
     
      
       
      (i) Requiring, or encouraging judges to expressly state that a discount had been given for a plea of guilty. 
       
       
      (ii) Requiring, or encouraging judges to quantify the extent of the discount. 
       
       
      (iii) Giving quantitative guidance to trial judges as to the amount, or range, of the appropriate discount, perhaps graduated in accordance with the timing of the plea. 
       
       
      Express Consideration by Sentencing Judges 
       
      
    40    The Crown submitted that this Court should state in a guideline judgment that where a sentencing judge has discounted a sentence because of a plea of guilty, the judge should say so expressly in the remarks on sentence. Whether or not a judge should quantify any such discount raises different considerations further considered below.  
     
      
    41    The Crown noted that s22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, and its predecessor in s439 of the Crimes Act 1900, only expressly require a sentencing judge to give reasons when not giving the offender a discount for his or her plea of guilty. However, subsection 22(3) states that the obligation to give reasons for not imposing a lesser penalty under s22(3), does not “limit any other requirement that a court has … to record the reasons for its decisions.” 
     
      
    42    Sentencing judges are under an obligation to give reasons for their decisions. Remarks on sentence are no different in this respect from other judgments. This is a manifestation of the fundamental principle of the common law that justice must not only be done but must manifestly be seen to be done. The obligation of a Court is to publish reasons for its decision, not merely to provide reasons to the parties. (See Kitto “Why Write Judgments” (1992) 66 ALJ 787; Pettitt v Dunkley  [1971] 1 NSWLR 376 at 382; Housing Commission of New South Wales v Tatmar Pastoral Co Pty Limited [1983] 3 NSWLR 378 at 385-386; Public Service Board NSW v Osmond (1986) 159 CLR 656 at 666-667; Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Limited (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 273, 277-281; Spigelman “Seen to be Done: The Principle of Open Justice: Part 1” (2000) 74 ALJ 290 esp at 294, 295). 
     
      
    43    The statement of reasons performs particularly significant functions in the administration of the criminal law. As Brennan J said in Jago v The District Court (NSW) (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 50: 
     
      
       
        
        “The victims of crime, who are not ordinarily parties to prosecutions on indictment and whose interests have generally gone unacknowledged until recent times, must be able to see that justice is done if they are not to be driven to self-help to rectify their grievances.” 
        
       
      
    44    To similar effect are the observations of Sir John Barry (quoted with approval by McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [39]) concerning the criminal law that: 
     
      
       
        
        “It must be administered publicly in such a fashion that its activities can be understood by ordinary citizens and regarded by them as conforming with the community’s generally accepted standards of what is fair and just.” 
        
       
       
      (See also  
      Richmond Newspapers v Virginia 
       448 US 555 (1980) at 571-572 per Burger CJ). 
       
      
    45    In some cases, the weight given to a plea becomes of particular significance to the sentencing process. This may be the case, for example, in assessing the issue of parity between co-offenders. An express reference is of particular significance in such a case. 
     
      
    46    A plea of guilty is a matter which sentencing judges are obliged to take into account pursuant to express statutory provision and, indeed, at common law. As part of the duty of sentencing judges to give reasons for their decision, express reference to the fact that consideration has been given to this factor ought to be included in reasons on sentence. 
     
      
    47    As Gleeson CJ said, in R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 230, with respect to the discount for assistance to authorities: 
     
      
       
        
        “A judge who extends leniency on the ground here in question should say that this is being done and why.” 
        
       
      
    48    The observations by Priestley JA in R v Holder [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 268-269, to the effect that this Court has not intervened in many cases in which there was no express reference by the sentencing judge to an allowance for a plea, preceded the enactment of s439 of the Crimes Act which imposed an express statutory obligation with respect to this matter. 
     
      
    49    Hunt J said in Gallagher supra at 234C, with respect to the discount for assistance to authorities, the absence of any reference to the fact that a discount had been allowed “will in most cases inevitably lead to the conclusion on appeal that no such discount has been allowed”. 
     
      
    50    Wood CJ at CL said in R v McCarroll [1999] NSWCCA 237 at [14]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although it cannot be imagined, in the circumstances in which the plea was entered that it was overlooked, it was a subjective circumstance capable of operation in mitigation of sentence. As such, it was necessary for his Honour to have spelt out the way in which it was taken into account or, if discounted, to explain why that was so:  
        Winchester 
         (1992) 58 A Crim R 345 at 350-351, and see s439(2) 
         Crimes Act 
         1900).” 
        
       
       
      (See also  
      R v Ma 
       (1999) 107 A Crim R 252 at 254).  
       
      
    51    Similar observations have been made by the Court of Criminal Appeal in South Australia, extending in that case to an identification of the extent of discount. (See e.g. Seagrim v R (Supreme Court of South Australia Court of Criminal Appeal, 9 December 1994, unreported at p3); R v Sutherland (Supreme Court of South Australia Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 November 1992, unreported at p3). 
     
      
    52    The absence of any reference to actual consideration of the guilty plea in the course of sentencing should, as a general rule, in the light of the obligation of sentencing judges to give reasons for their decision, lead to an inference that the plea was not given weight. This conclusion is significantly influenced by the express statutory obligations. The position may not be the same with respect to other matters which are required to be taken into account, either at common law or by reason of a general scheme listing relevant considerations, such as that found in s16A of the Crimes Act (Cth) 1914. 
     
      
    53    It may not have been entirely clear prior to this judgment that the absence of reference to consideration of a guilty plea in the sentencing process would generally be regarded, on appeal, as an indication that a relevant consideration had not been given weight. In the course of formulating this guideline the Court has been asked to determine that such should be regarded as the case in the future. This is designed to overcome the problem that the evidence and submissions before the Court in these proceedings have identified, namely the extent to which practitioners do not accept that a guilty plea, particularly an early plea, is in fact taken into account by sentencing judges. As part of the process of overcoming this perception the Court should, in my opinion, adopt the approach as generally applicable to decisions on sentencing for State offences delivered after a reasonable period following the handing down of this judgment. 
     
      
       
      Quantification and the Instinctive Synthesis 
       
      
    54    There are two distinct but interrelated aspects of a guideline judgment, as proposed in the Crown submissions, involving matters of quantification. First, whether or not the Court should encourage trial judges to state the amount of discount, either in percentage terms or by an indication of the sentence that they would otherwise have imposed. Secondly, whether the Court should lay down a percentage, or range, for a discount for a plea of guilty and, if so, what matters of relevance to the sentencing process should be encompassed within any such percentage or range. 
     
      
    55    Each of these two aspects of the proposed guideline judgment would, if adopted, constitute qualifications on the approach to sentencing which has generally found favour in Australia, to the effect that it is undesirable to separately quantify any of the multifarious elements involved in the process of determining a final sentence (subject of course to express statutory provision). This Court has always recognised that the purposes of punishment include a wide range of incommensurable, and sometimes conflicting, objectives - deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation, and public condemnation - which must be brought together by a sentencing judge in what the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria has aptly described as an “instinctive synthesis”. (R v Williscroft [1975] VR 292 at 300). That judgment referred with approval to the dictum of Jordan CJ in R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554 at 555, that in the case of sentencing “the only golden rule is that there is no golden rule”. 
     
      
    56    The inapplicability of any formulaic approach to the exercise of a sentencing discretion has frequently been emphasised. For example, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said in Pearce v The Queen supra at [46]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Sentencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer arrived at by some process admitting of mathematical precision.” 
        
       
      
    57    The instinctive synthesis approach is the correct general approach to sentencing. This does not, however, necessarily mean that there is no element which can be taken out and treated separately, although such elements ought be few in number and narrowly confined. As long as they are such, their separate treatment will not compromise the intuitive or instinctive character of the sentencing process considered as a whole. 
     
      
    58    On occasions a statute may require a court to expressly indicate what sentence it would have imposed if certain events did not, or do not, occur. This is the case under s21E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), where a court must specify the sentence that would have been imposed if the offender had not undertaken to cooperate with the authorities. There is no reason in principle why the common law principles of sentencing could not establish other such specific exceptions to the general approach, without altering the basic character of the process. 
     
      
    59    The different approaches are often expressed in terms of a contrast between the “instinctive synthesis” approach, on the one hand, and a “two-tier” approach to sentencing, on the other. This contrast has arisen in a number of different contexts, including: 
     
      
    · the separate identification of a sentence “proportionate” to the gravity of the offence and the actual sentence imposed. (R v Young [1990] VR 951 esp at 954-5, 957, 960-961 per Young CJ, Crockett and Nathan JJ). 
     
      
    · the separate identification of a sentence appropriate to the objective circumstance of the case and the effect of mitigating circumstances. (R v Garforth (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 23 May 1994, unreported at 3-4 per Gleeson CJ, McInerney and Mathews JJ); R v Lett (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 27 March 1995, unreported at 8-9 per Hunt CJ at CL with whom Sully and Levine JJ agreed)). 
     
      
    · express credit for surrendering privileges, such as extradition rights. (AB v The Queen (1999) 198 CLR 111 at [99] per Kirby J, contra [12]-[19] per McHugh J and [113]-[120] per Hayne JA). 
     
      
    · Discount for assistance. (R v Gallagher supra at 227-228, 230 per Gleeson CJ, 233-234 per Hunt J; R v Perrier (No 2) [1991] VR 697 at 725-727 per McGarvie J (with whom Murphy J agreed), 728-731 per Brooking J (dissenting); R v Harris and Simmonds (1992) 59 SASR 300 at 302 per King CJ; R v Nagy [1992] 1 VR 637 at 643-645 per McGarvie J (dissenting)). 
     
      
    · Discount for guilty plea. (R v Beavan (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 22 August 1991, unreported at 12-15 per Hunt J with whom Badgery-Parker and Abadee JJ agreed); R v Holder supra at 258 per Street CJ and 270 per Priestley JA; R v Morton [1986] VR 863 at 868 per Young CJ, King and Beach JJ at 868; Pavlic v R (1995) 5 TasR 186;  Verschuren v The Queen (1996) 17 WAR 467). 
     
      
    60    The proposition that a “two-tiered” approach to sentencing is erroneous has recently been supported by two judges of the High Court, McHugh and Hayne JJ in AB v The Queen supra. These were dissenting judgments, however only the judgment of Kirby J, esp at [99], suggests a different approach. The other members of the majority in AB, Gummow and Callinan JJ at [55], determined the case on the basis that legal error had been shown by reason of the failure to take into account considerations relevant to the sentencing process. 
     
      
    61    McHugh J referred to the Appellant’s claim for a “discount” for the conduct that was relevant - waiver of the rule of speciality with respect to extraditable offences. His Honour said at [12]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the claim could have validity only if sentencing was a process that involved a notional sentence which is then increased or reduced arithmetically according to individual factors relevant to the offence and the accused person.” 
        
       
      
    62    His Honour approved the “instinctive synthesis” approach as expressed in Williscroft and referred to the conflicting objectives of sentencing. His Honour said [15]-[18]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The two-tiered approach of determining an objective sentence and then adjusting it is in conflict with the discretionary nature of the sentencing process. Discretionary judgments require the weighing of elements, not the formulation of adjustable rules or benchmarks. … 
        
       
       
        
        To adopt a two-tiered approach to sentencing by beginning with an objectively determined sentence which is then arithmetically adjusted to take account of various factors is also a process which is plainly unsuited to the sentencing process in many cases. … If the judge first formulates an objectively determined sentence, he or she has only relied on part of the relevant circumstances and has effectively allowed that part of the circumstances to dominate the sentencing process. Worse still, there is a danger that the objectively determined sentence will be formulated by reference to abstractions derived from the circumstances, rather than by reference to the concrete facts of the case. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The factors bearing on the sentence will vary from case to case. Frequently, they will point in different directions. The task of the sentencing judge or magistrate is not to add and subtract from an objectively determined sentence but to balance the various factors and make a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence in all the circumstances of the case …” 
        
       
      
    63    Hayne J made express reference to the case of a guilty plea at [113]-[114] and referred to the submission made to the Court that a further reduction in sentence should have been afforded to the Appellant by reason of the waiver of his extradition rights. His Honour at [115]-[116] said there were several flaws in the argument as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “First, it assumes that sentencing an offender is some mechanical or mathematical process. It is not. Nobody can identify, let alone define, some precise relationship between the complex and infinitely various elements that bear upon what sentence is to be imposed on an offender such as this appellant. No calculus will reveal some mathematical relationship between this appellant’s remorse, the harm he has inflicted on his victims and society’s denunciation of what he did to them. A sentencing judge can do no more than weigh these and the many other factors (such as retribution and deterrence) that bear upon the question and express the result as several terms of imprisonment to be served, wholly or partly concurrently or consecutively. Remorse, harm, denunciation, retribution and deterrence - in the end all these and more must be expressed by a sentencing judge in units of time. That is a discretionary judgment. It is not a task that is to be performed by calculation. Resort to metaphors such as ‘discount’ or ‘allowance’ must not be taken as suggesting that it can be.  
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, leniency may be given to an offender where to do so advances some policy of the criminal law. In any case in which an accused person waives his right not to be prosecuted for non-extradition offences it may be expected that his waiver would attract leniency. It may be accepted that there are powerful policy reasons for encouraging and rewarding such conduct. But they are the same policy reasons that operate in the case of confession to previously unknown crime. Waiver of rights will usually reveal remorse and contrition; the State is saved the cost of further protracted and expensive proceedings; the victims are vindicated without their having to suffer the ordeal of giving evidence at the trial. And as is the case where an offender confesses to previously unknown crime, it may be thought probable that no conviction would have been recorded had the offender not taken the step, as he did in this case, of waiving his rights.” 
        
       
      
    64    Kirby J, however, said that an express reference to the credit was desirable and suggested that quantification was permissible. His Honour said at [99]-[100]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Unless the sentencing judge were to mark in a specific and express way the credit to which the appellant was entitled for having surrendered his privilege to insist on the rule of speciality under extradition law, the outcome of this case would not encourage others, in a like position, to act as he did. (cf  
        R v Winchester 
         (1992) A Crim R 345 at 350: ‘The leniency is afforded in order to encourage early pleas of guilty so that the criminal list is more expeditiously disposed of and so that other cases, in which there is a genuine issue to be determined, will be brought on for hearing without delay.’) On the contrary, to the extent that the decisions of the sentencing judge and of the majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal became known to the legal profession, they would tend to reinforce the provision of advice to persons extradited to Australia, as the appellant had been, to confess to no further offences and to insist upon the strict observance of the privilege derived from the rule of speciality accorded to them by extradition law. That cannot be a result which is in the interests of the criminal justice system, of accused persons, of the victims of crime or of society. It is not, therefore, a result which a proper approach to sentencing would uphold. 
        
       
       
        
        Due and explicit regard ought to have been given to the significance of the appellant’s waiver of extradition rights, i.e. his non-insistence on the rule of speciality. It was a consideration different from, and additional to, contrition, the clearing up of crime difficult to detect and the saving of public costs.” 
        
       
       
      See also  
      R v McDonnell 
       (1997) 145 DLR (4th) 577 at 605-606 per McLachlin J. 
       
      
    65    The issue of a “discount” for a plea of guilty involves similar issues to those which arise in the context of a “discount” for cooperation with the authorities. The matter was the subject of consideration in this Court in R v Gallagher supra. In that case the submission was made that the trial judge was obliged to give a discrete discount which was either separately quantified or quantifiable for the assistance given. This Court held that it was not necessary to give a discrete and precisely quantified or quantifiable discount. 
     
      
    66    Gleeson CJ indicated that there had been judgments in which a discount of a specific character was quantified and there were authorities supporting the appropriateness of the two-tier process in some circumstances. Gleeson CJ concluded at 230: 
     
      
       
        
        “A judge who extends leniency on the ground here in question should say that this is being done and why. However, I am of the view that, subject always to any relevant statutory requirement, a sentencing judge is entitled, but not obliged, to give a discrete quantifiable discount on the ground of assistance to authorities, provided it is otherwise possible and appropriate to do so. For reasons earlier stated, there may be many cases in which it is either impossible or inappropriate to take that course. Even in cases where, as a matter of legitimate discretionary decision, a judge decides to give a specified discount it is essential to bear in mind that what is involved is not a rigid or mathematical exercise, to be governed by ‘tariffs’ derived from other and different cases but, rather, one of a number of matters to be taken into account in a discretionary exercise that must display due sensitivity towards all the considerations of policy which govern sentencing as an aspect of the administration of justice.” 
        
       
      
    67    Notwithstanding the forceful and persuasive reasons often expressed in favour of an “instinctive synthesis” approach - most recently by McHugh and Hayne JJ in AB - this passage in the reasons of Gleeson CJ in Gallagher indicates that there will be cases in which a specific element can be the subject of quantification, without turning the process into a mechanical or mathematical exercise. 
     
      
    68    However, as Gleeson CJ had also said earlier in his reasons at 227-228, it may not always be possible or appropriate to separate a particular element: 
     
      
       
        
        “As a matter of logic, I find it difficult to understand how it could be the case that it is always necessary, or always possible, to give a specific and separate discount of the kind referred to. The present case provides a good illustration of the difficulties involved. The authorities which discuss the relevant principles demonstrate that, where an offender is entitled to have assistance to authorities taken into account in his favour, that will usually be upon a number of grounds, at least some of which may overlap with other subjective matters to be taken into account in his favour. The considerations that are relevant are discussed in  
        R v Perez-Vargas 
         (1986) 8 NSWLR 559. There is what might be called the utilitarian consideration involved in encouraging persons to provide information which will permit the apprehension and successful prosecution of other offenders. Public opinion seems to accept this as reasonable enough in a case where, for example, a middle level dealer in a drug operation provides information enabling the apprehension and prosecution of more senior persons in the organisation. The approach seems to be less readily accepted in some other circumstances, especially in cases where there is an identifiable victim of violent crime, or where imprisoned informers, sometimes of extremely doubtful reliability, are seen to be taking cynical advantage of a system which may lend itself to exploitation by the unscrupulous. However, those issues, whilst important, are not of immediate relevance. Other considerations that enter into the matter include the remorse or contrition which may be demonstrated in a given case by co-operation with the authorities, and the more difficult time which an informer is likely to have during the period of incarceration as a result of having co-operated. Those last-mentioned matters may, depending upon the circumstances, be very difficult to separate from other considerations which might arise quite apart from the matter of assistance to the authorities. In this case, for example, the appellant was entitled to receive, and received, credit for pleading guilty, and for the contrition for which that plea of guilty reflected. It was also said to be to his credit that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. It seems hardly likely that these were subjective matters which were entirely separate from the matter of his assistance to the authorities. It must often be the case that an offender’s conduct in pleading guilty, his expressions of contrition, his willingness to co-operate with the authorities, and the personal risks to which he thereby exposes himself, will form a complex of inter-related considerations, and an attempt to separate out one or more of those considerations will not only be artificial and contrived, but will also be illogical.” 
        
       
      
    69    In a separate judgment Hunt J said at 233-234: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the reference in  
        R v Cartwright 
         (at 250) to the need for a substantial discount to be allowed (and to be seen to be allowed) does not mean that the discount for the prisoner’s assistance to the authorities must in every case be shown as a precisely quantified or quantifiable period or percentage. As the Chief Justice has said, in some cases there will be an overlap between the ‘utilitarian’ consideration of encouraging prisoners to give such assistance and what may be called the ordinary subjective features of remorse or contrition which such co-operation may also demonstrate. In such cases it may be difficult to identify a separate quantified discount for the former. In such a case, once the judge has determined that the assistance is a matter which should be taken into account, he or she will sufficiently be seen to be allowing a substantial discount for that assistance if a statement is made merely that it has been allowed. 
        
       
       
        
        … the Crown’s desire to encourage similar assistance in other cases will adequately be served by such a statement. 
        
       
       
        
        Nevertheless, if a separate discount for assistance to the authorities can be identified, I would prefer that it be identified. I consider that a preference for such course to be followed (where possible), is supported by provisions such as s21E of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1914 (Cth). But I agree with the Chief Justice that, subject to such a statutory requirement, it still remains a discretionary matter in each case whether the judge does so in that case. 
        
       
       
        
        I should emphasis that, whilst a judge cannot reasonably be expected to identify in his remarks on sentence every consideration which was taken into account in arriving at the particular sentence, the absence of any reference to at least the fact that a discount has been allowed for the prisoner’s assistance to the authorities will in most cases inevitably lead to the conclusion on appeal that no such discount had been allowed.” 
        
       
      
    70    This reasoning is of significance for the issue which has arisen in the present case between the Crown and Attorney, on the one hand, and the Public Defender and Defence counsel on the other. The latter proposed a guideline limited to the utilitarian benefits. The former seek to have the element of contrition included. As the reasons of Gleeson CJ in Gallagher show, it is the contrition aspect which is most likely to overlap with other matters relevant to the sentencing process, including other evidence of contrition. 
     
      
    71    For the reasons advanced in Gallagher, it will not be possible in every case to separate the utilitarian benefit from a plea from the contrition element or from other factors. Where, however, it is possible and appropriate to do so, Gleeson CJ concludes it is open for a sentencing judge to provide a quantification of the discount and Hunt J indicates it is desirable that it be done. A similar approach may be appropriate with respect to a plea of guilty. 
     
      
    72    As this Court has emphasised in previous guideline judgments (Jurisic supra at 220-221; Henry supra at [25]-[30]; R v Wong (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 at [32]) a guideline is not binding in any formal sense. It does not constrain the exercise of the discretion. Accordingly, a guideline which indicates that sentencing judges should, where appropriate, quantify a discount for a plea operates by way of encouragement and not be way of prescription. The issue for this Court is whether it should encourage first instance judges to do so, where appropriate, as Hunt J did in Gallagher with respect to the discount for assistance. For the reasons given in Gallagher such encouragement is not inconsistent with an instinctive synthesis approach, particularly if limited to the utilitarian value of a plea. 
     
      
    73    The position in this State has hitherto been that it is not desirable to quantify a separate discount for a plea of guilty. This was articulated by Hunt J, with whom Badgery-Parker J and Abadee J agreed, in Beavan supra at 12 where, after his Honour identified the degree of leniency to be afforded by reason of a plea as depending on a number of different factors, specifically the elements of contrition and utilitarian value, his Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “ …it is quite impossible to identify any particular discount which is appropriate or which may usually be expected where a plea of guilty is entered. There is, in my respectful view, no conventional wisdom that a certain percentage will be allowed for such a plea.” 
        
       
      
    74    His Honour concluded at 14-15: 
     
      
       
        
        “Sentencing is largely an intuitive process. It does not lend itself to the application of rigid formulas. The influences of the different factors to be taken into account in each case are infinitely various. In many cases, the different factors overlap and it would be almost impossible for a judge to identify the precise influence which any one factor has had upon the sentence ultimately imposed. Discounts for assistance given to the authorities, where they can be identified, may fall within a special category … But, that category to one side, I regard it as both unnecessary and often unwise for a sentencing judge to identify a sentence which he or she regards as appropriate to the particular case without reference to one factor and then to identify the discount which is thought to be appropriate with regard to that particular factor …” 
        
       
      
    75    When his Honour came to repeat this reasoning in Lett supra at p9 his Honour added to the reference to specification of a discount as being “unnecessary” and “unwise”, the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is unwise because it will only multiply the possibility of error, and it is unnecessary because it will inevitably increase the incidence of arguable appeal points.” 
        
       
      
    76    In this regard his Honour’s reasons appear to coincide with the reasons of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Morton supra at 868 where their Honours noted the statutory provision requiring the Court to state the fact that a reduction for a plea of guilty had been given, and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “The requirement is to state the fact not the amount of the reduction and although there is nothing to prohibit a court’s stating the amount of the reduction, it will generally be impossible or misleading to do so unless a similar quantification is placed upon all the other elements or considerations that have led to the calculation of the sentence actually imposed. Indeed it would generally be highly undesirable to do so.” 
        
       
      
    77    Hunt CJ at CL returned to the issue of the undesirability of quantification in R v Winchester supra and I repeat what his Honour said at 350: 
     
      
       
        
        “Encouragement will be given to early pleas of guilty only if they lead (and are seen to lead) to a substantial reduction in the sentence imposed. That does not mean that the sentencing judge should show a precisely quantified or quantifiable period or percentage as having been allowed. Indeed, it is better that it not be shown; that was the point of this Court’s decision in  
        Beavan 
         at pp14-15. As was said in that case - discounts for assistance given to the authorities to one side - is both unnecessary and often unwise for the judge to identify the sentence which he or she regards as appropriate to the particular case without reference to one factor and then to identify the allowance made which is thought to be appropriate to that particular factor.” 
        
       
      
    78    The issue for this Court is whether this approach should be continued in the light of the material now presented to the Court that the objective of encouraging early pleas is not being attained in this State. An alternative is to adopt the approach that the Court has taken in the analogous area of discount for assistance to authorities. 
     
      
       
      Interstate Practice 
       
      
    79    The position in Victoria has traditionally been one of hostility to any “two-tiered” approach, subject of course to statutory modifications. 
     
      
    80    The Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal reaffirmed its opposition to a “two stage” sentencing process in R v O’Brien (1991) 55 A Crim R 410. The Court reaffirmed the approach in Williscroft and Young, but noted that the position may be qualified by statute.  
     
      
    81    The Court went on to refer to the analogous matter of a discount for cooperation with the authorities and specifically to the majority decision in Perrier (No 2) supra. The Court said at 415: 
     
      
       
        
        “Courts that have dealt with this aspect of punishment have on occasion referred to the need for the offender to know of the fact of such a reduction having been made and even the extent of it. The adoption of such an approach in the case of an informer whose services it might be thought should deservedly be reflected in his sentence may thought to be in conflict with the Court’s opinion expressed in  
        Young’s 
         case. That would be so if effect were given to this sentencing factor disengaged from a consideration of the other sentencing factors … .” 
        
       
      
    82    The Court noted that Gleeson CJ in Gallagher supra at 229, recognised that the approach of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal and of the South Australian Court, differed from the Victorian approach in Young’s case. The Court approved Brooking J in Perrier (No 2) supra at 727-728 and concluded at 416-417: 
     
      
       
        
        “The benefit to the community of an informer’s co-operation is just another factor relevant to the selection of a proper sentence to impose. The extent to which that benefit will command clemency will vary greatly. In some cases it may be so great that in reflecting it the sentence may be very much less than might otherwise be the case. To attempt to govern the exercise of the sentencing discretion by reference to a tabulated scale of reductions in percentage or other terms is, we think, wrong in principle. It is also in conflict with authority by which we are bound. Immediately following the passage from  
        Williscroft 
         which we have cited the court went on to say: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Moreover, in our view, it is profitless (as it was thought to be in  
          Kane’s 
           case) to attempt to allot to the various considerations their proper part in the assessment of the particular punishments presently under examination.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        As we understand it that passage represents the law in this State. In some cases it may be thought that public policy requires publication in the judge’s sentencing remarks of the actual extent by which a sentence has been reduced by reason of some identified extenuating factor. That may be so. But we think that the occasions for departure from accepted sentencing practice on such a ground will be rare and reasons should be expressed for any such departure.” 
        
       
      
    83    Notwithstanding this approach, the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal has found quantification by a trial judge not to constitute appellable error. In R v Tierney (1990) 51 A Crim R 446, the trial judge had identified the sentence he would have imposed but for the plea of guilty. One ground of appeal was that this was impermissible because it adopted a two stage structured approach which was inconsistent with the “instinctive synthesis” approach for determining the appropriate sentence. Crockett J, with whom Fullagar and Hampel JJ agreed, rejected the submission. At 448 his Honour directed attention to the statutory provision in s4 of the Penalties and Sentences Act 1985 (Vic) which required the Court to take this matter into account and doubted that the process of determining an appropriate sentence and reduction for the guilty plea involved a two stage process. Crockett J at 449 interpreted Morton as holding that it was permissible for a sentencing judge to state the amount of the reduction. Although it might be undesirable to do so, there was no prohibition upon that course.  
     
      
    84    In R v Nagy supra Crockett and J. D. Phillips JJ affirmed that the intuitive synthesis approach was inconsistent with quantification of a discount for assistance. McGarvie J in dissent in this respect, gave detailed reasons for identifying the specific discounts for assistance to authorities, at least in certain cases such as that of drug couriers. McGarvie J noted at 645-646 that it was always open to a sentencing judge to approach the sentencing task by selecting an appropriate sentence before discount and reducing it by a specified amount of the discount. His Honour referred to the decision of this Court in Gallagher supra, where Gleeson CJ and Hunt J indicated that it was open but not obligatory for a sentencing judge to indicate a discrete quantifiable discount. 
     
      
    85    The reasoning of McGarvie J in Nagy with respect to the discount for assistance to authorities is relevant to a discount for the plea of guilty, particularly if the utilitarian value of the plea is considered separately from contrition. His Honour said at 649-650: 
     
      
       
        
        “Quantifying the total discount involves little more than determining the sentences and non-parole period the applicant deserved when first apprehended and those now deserved in the light of his subsequent co-operation with the law enforcement agencies and pleas of guilty. In my view there is nothing about this case which makes it in any way misleading to state the amounts of reduction without placing a similar quantification upon each of the other elements or considerations that have led to the calculation of the sentences and non-parole period finally selected. 
        
       
       
        
        The factors for which discounts are allowed to the applicant are of a kind which naturally distinguishes them from the factors relevant to fixing the sentence otherwise appropriate. The discounts are given partly to recognise and give the applicant sentencing advantage for his conduct after apprehension in relation to investigations and proceedings against him and others … The informer’s discount is given in acknowledgment of the necessity for encouraging people to inform … A discount is less effective to encourage conduct by other offenders if they do not become aware of what discounts have been allowed or what the sentences would have been without them. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
         
         
        For reasons which I stated in  
        R v Perrier (No 2) 
         [1991] 1 VR 717, I consider that one of the most effective ways of the courts protecting the community from the damage done by such crimes, is by sentencing so that it becomes known that a courier apprehended in the circumstances of the applicant faces a heavy sentence unless co-operation with the authorities is forthcoming, but co-operation of a high order as an informer will earn a high discount: and that the best way of letting this be known is by exercising the discretion, where practicable, of stating the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed and the amount of the discount reduction.” 
        
       
      
    86    In Queensland the Court adopted a similar position to that of Victoria. De Jersey J (McPherson J concurring) said in R v Harman [1989] 1 Qd R 414 at 421: 
     
      
       
        
        “I consider … that the concept of identifiable discounts is wholly inappropriate. 
        
       
       
        
        One could envisage the emergence of a pattern of such discounts were they specified. Prisoners would rely on them, and perhaps found unreasonable expectations upon them. Attention could tend to focus on the pattern or scale, rather than upon particular circumstances. Such a situation could lead to rigidity, and in a practical sense, impose fetters on the sentencing discretion. 
        
       
       
        
        In cases where such matters as pleas of guilty, remorse, saving of public resources, etc., are considered relevant, it is enough that the sentencing judge takes account of them in determining the sentence … Although I do not of course purport to lay down any rule, in the ordinary case it would not, I think, be generally helpful to specify, in terms of a time period, the particular extent to which such factors have operated to reduce the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed.” 
        
       
      
    87    In R v Corrigan [1994] 2 Qd R 415, the Queensland Court of Appeal reconsidered the position after passage of s13 in the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992 (Qld) which required a court to take into account a guilty plea and conferred a discretion “to reduce the sentence that it would have imposed”. Subsection 13(3) imposed an obligation to “state in open court” that the guilty plea has been taken into account. 
     
      
    88    Macrossan CJ and Lee J said at 416: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is obviously desirable for a sentencing court to state specifically how it is reducing a sentence when it purports to do so. If an appeal is subsequently brought and it is contended that the sentence imposed is excessive because there has been no sufficient reduction made, the question whether there has, in truth, been a reduction at all and also whether the reduction is sufficient will be considered by the appeal court.” 
        
       
      
    89    On the materials before the Court, it does not appear that any practice has developed in Queensland of quantifying a sentence discount. It is not clear to this Court to what extent the remarks in Corrigan have led to a qualification of the earlier observations in Harman. 
     
      
    90    The position in South Australia is that the Court of Criminal Appeal encourages trial judges to indicate the extent of the discount given for a guilty plea. In R v Sutherland (Supreme Court of South Australia Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 November 1992, unreported) King CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court of Criminal Appeal has stressed the importance of the discount for a plea of guilty in the administration of justice. It is intended to encourage guilty persons to admit their guilt, instead of putting the state to the cost and trouble of a criminal trial and thereby contributing to the congestion of the criminal list. This is an important public policy consideration, and judges are to be encouraged to foster an awareness amongst people charged with criminal offences, and those who advise them, of the advantage to be gained by a guilty person by acknowledging his guilt at the first reasonable opportunity. 
        
       
       
        
        General awareness of the advantage to be gained by a plea of guilty would be contributed to by judges indicating clearly, in their sentencing remarks, not only that they have taken the plea of guilty into account, but also the extent to which they have taken it into account. 
        
       
       
        
        I think that this court should actively encourage sentencing judges to take that course. 
        
       
       
        
        It does not follow, of course, that merely because the learned judge did not indicate the extent to which he took the plea of guilty into account, that he did not give it appropriate weight. That can only be judged by assessing what would have been a reasonable sentence if there had been no plea of guilty, and comparing it with a sentence actually imposed.” 
        
       
      
    91    King CJ also said in R v Harris & Simmonds supra at 302: 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court of Criminal Appeal has said on earlier occasions in relation to the discount for a plea of guilty, that it not only ought to be given, but that the judge should indicate so far as possible, and wherever possible, the extent of the discount which he is making for the plea of guilty. If the discount given for a plea of guilty is to operate as a real incentive the guilty persons to plead guilty, it is necessary that they, and their advisers, have a clear idea of the sort of discount that will be made on that account.” 
        
       
      
    92    To similar effect, in R v Charnley (Supreme Court of South Australia Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 August 1994, unreported) Pryor J with whom Olsson and Perry JJ agreed said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is to be noted that neither Judge indicated what sentence of imprisonment would have been imposed had there not been a plea of guilty. This Court has said on a number of occasions that sentencing Judges should do that. People admitting crimes are to be given some proper discount for a plea of guilty, more so the sooner that it is made. They should be told what it is.” 
        
       
       
      (See also  
      Seagrim v R 
       supra per King CJ at p3). 
       
      
    93    As a result of this guideline by the Court of Criminal Appeal in South Australia, South Australian sentencing judges generally reveal in their remarks on sentence the extent of a discount given. (See e.g. R v Rooke (Supreme Court of South Australia Court of Criminal Appeal, 19 June 1998, unreported); R v Colbert (Supreme Court of South Australia Courrt of Criminal Appeal, 20 August 1998, unreported); R v Hann (Supreme Court of South Australia Court of Criminal Appeal, 17 August 1998, unreported); R v Perre (Supreme Court of South Australia Court of Criminal Appeal, 20 October 1997, unreported)). 
     
      
    94    The Court of Criminal Appeal of the Supreme Court of Tasmania considered this issue in Pavlic v The Queen supra. In that case Green CJ and Wright J concluded that no separate quantifiable discount needs to be given for a plea of guilty. Slicer J however came to a different conclusion. Green CJ at 191 described the submission that a plea of guilty and assistance should be reflected in a nominated percentage “discount” as a “formalised approach”. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Considerations of this kind are no different in kind from and should be treated in the same way as all the other considerations which are relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion. It is not regarded as appropriate to reflect the other aggravating and mitigating circumstances relevant to sentence and a list of premiums or discounts each expressed as a percentage and I can see no reason why mitigating circumstances arising out of remorse, a plea of guilty or assistance given to the police should be treated differently.” 
        
       
      
    95    To similar effect Wright J concluded at 193: 
     
      
       
        
        “To achieve a just result in any case, all relevant mitigatory facts must be considered and weighed in the balance along with the facts, circumstances and features of aggravation (if any) relied on by the prosecution. Included in this process is the fact, if it be a fact, that the offender has pleaded guilty. The weight of that plea may vary greatly in the evaluative process undertaken by the court. It would be clearly wrong, in my view, to assess sentence on the basis of all known facts excluding the plea of guilty, arriving thereby at an ‘appropriate’ sentence and then, as a separate process, to discount that sentence by an identifiable percentage or fraction to produce the final or effective sentence. In my opinion there is no justification for treating the guilty plea in this specialised way. It is a factor deserving weight, but it is not weight that can or should be assessed as a separate secondary process. All mitigating features must be considered but none justifies or requires a specific quantified discount.” 
        
       
      
    96    Slicer J adopted a different approach. His Honour accepted that the “instinctive synthesis” approach to determination of sentence was the basic methodology adopted by Australian Courts. (See e.g. at 200 and 201-202). Nevertheless his Honour distinguished the effect of the plea on the contrition element, from its utilitarian value. The later he referred to in terms of “administrative and social efficiency” and indicated that it, together with the issue of a discount for cooperation with authorities, raised different considerations. He said at 200 that these two matters: 
     
      
       
        
        “… involve consideration external to the particular circumstances of the case. The assessment of mitigating effect is dependent on the value of the information proffered, the economic savings afforded the community and like matters.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour added: 
       
       
        
        “… it should be recognised that the factor is one that differs from the historical basis of determination of penalty. It should be seen as an expression of public policy extending beyond the particular case under consideration. … 
        
       
       
        
        The adoption of the social utilitarian rationale is preferred because it is difficult to reconcile the acceptance of plea with the existing principles determining punishment. If that be correct, then it should be recognised and applied as a separate matter extrinsic to the subjective factors arising from the circumstances of the case itself.” 
        
       
      
    97    Accordingly, his Honour, whilst generally expressing his agreement with an intuitive synthesis approach to the determination of sentences, so that it was undesirable to quantify a level of discount for separate elements, added at 205: 
     
      
       
        
        “Nevertheless, it is not inappropriate in cases where for policy reasons a discount is afforded, for the sentencing court to state what effect was given the plea. The sentence could first be determined in accordance with the ‘intuitive synthesis’ methodology and stated. Then reference could be made only to those factors external to the circumstances of the case, namely degree of social or public utility, their import then identified and their significance expressed. This should permit an analysis as to whether sufficient significance was afforded the plea.” 
        
       
      
    98    These issues have most recently been considered in Western Australia in Verschuren v The Queen supra. Malcolm CJ made it clear at 469 that there was no tariff or fixed percentage applicable to a discount for a plea of guilty. His Honour referred with approval to prior authority in the Court in which an early plea of guilty under that State’s “fast track system” attracted a discount of the order of 20-25 percent and 30-35 percent. His Honour noted that there were different views expressed in the Court as to whether a sentencing judge should inform the offender of a specific figure or percentage of the reduction on account of plea. His Honour also referred to the divergence of views in other courts, e.g. Perrier (No 2) and Pavlic. His Honour identified the “intuitive synthesis” approach and also referred to the judgment of Gleeson CJ and Hunt J in Gallagher and of McGarvie J in Nagy. His Honour indicated that he agreed with the conclusions of Slicer J in Pavlic supra at 206 that a two stage process was appropriate and that, initially, a sentence should be determined in accordance with the “intuitive synthesis” approach and a second stage could apply utilitarian considerations based on public policy. Malcolm CJ added at 473: 
     
      
       
        
        “Public policy considerations which apply to co-operation with the authorities extend also to a plea of guilty in appropriate circumstances. I consider, however, that a need for a qualification arises where a finding of genuine remorse has also been made. This is a subjective circumstance. It should be taken into account at the first stage.” 
        
       
      
    99    In this regard his Honour appears to have been referring to the reasoning of Gleeson CJ and Hunt J in Gallagher to the effect that here is frequently an overlap between issues of contrition and the public policy issues involved. Malcolm CJ’s ultimate conclusion, at 474, was to the same effect as that of Hunt J in Gallagher: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, however, recognising that it is a matter for discretion of the individual judge, it is clearly desirable that the discount be quantified wherever it is practicable to do so.” 
        
       
      
    100    Pidgeon J reached a similar conclusion. At 474 his Honour held: 
     
      
       
        
        “I consider, however, that it is of importance for the sentencing judge to make it clear to the person being sentenced that he or she is receiving a significant discount for an early plea. This is one reason for the way of giving the discount for which the Chief Justice has indicated a preference. The advantage in doing it this way is that the person being sentenced realises he is receiving a discount and it makes it easier to review the sentence.” 
        
       
      
    101    His Honour went on to refer to the West Australian legislative scheme for a “fast track” and concluded at 475: 
     
      
       
        
        “I would see it as being inherent in the legislation, and the reason for the enactment of the legislation, that discounts of the type to which I have referred are given and are seen by the offender to have been given. For my own part I would see the best way as being the way for which the Chief Justice has expressed a preference. It may not always be appropriate for it to be done this way and I would not see it as obligatory to do it this way.” 
        
       
      
    102    Murray J was of a different view. His Honour summarised the judgment of Malcolm CJ at 481 in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “After review of various relevant authorities Malcolm CJ makes it clear that he considers the two-tiered approach to be preferable for reasons which, as I understand them, if his Honour will forgive the summary, include the following - 
        
       
       
        
        (1) To quantify the reduction enables the offender to know what credit he has received. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) By that means, other offenders may be encouraged to plead guilty or offer co-operation and information. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) To quantify the discounts enables proper comparison between the case of the particular offender and a co-offender who has not earned such a discount. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) For such reasons of parity and otherwise, the quantification of the discount may aid consideration of the case by an appellate court. 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour does not say that a sentencing judge will err if, in the process of arriving at his or her sentence, such discounts are not quantified, but as he expresses a clear preference for the two-tiered approach I think it is incumbent upon me to express here the view about that to which I have referred on other occasions.” 
        
       
      
    103    His Honour went on to indicate his disagreement with any form of two-tiered approach. He invoked the “instinctive synthesis” terminology from Williscroft, emphasising the complexity of the relationship of the various factual matters relevant to sentencing. His Honour said at 482: 
     
      
       
        
        “The complexities involved, in my opinion, make it almost invariably doubtful that a specific quantification of the influence of the factor under consideration may be meaningfully expressed in the process of arriving at the proportionate sentence finally pronounced.” 
        
       
      
    104    His Honour noted that in Punch v The Queen (1993) 9 WAR 486 the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia concluded that a two-tiered approach of itself did not demonstrate sentencing error. 
     
      
    105    His Honour referred to the judgment of Slicer J in Pavlic with which Malcolm CJ had expressed approval and said at 491: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear from the earlier part of his judgment that by ‘factors external of the circumstances of the case’, his Honour meant to identify the matters affecting the degree of assistance to the process of the administration of the criminal law which the plea or cooperation provided had afforded, rather than those ‘subjective’ matters such as the intention or motivation of the offender, which might be regarded as personal to him or her. For my part, with respect, I can see no advantage in separating out some of the matters attendant upon the making of a plea of guilty or the provision of assistance to the police and prosecuting authorities and identifying their impact upon the sentencing process separately from other relevant factors.” 
        
       
       
      Murray J concluded at 491: 
       
       
        
        “… I would take the view that it is neither an error of principle to adopt a two stage or two-tiered approach to the fixing of sentence, nor to decline to do so. In passing sentence, a judge has the well recognised obligation to explain what he or she is doing so that the process may be understood by both the offender and the community at large. That is not a task which can meaningfully be performed by identifying each or any particular factor, whether of an aggravating or mitigating kind, and whether concerned with the circumstances of the commission of the offence or the circumstances personal to the offender, and then endeavouring to describe in quantified terms the impact of that factor upon the sentencing process.” 
        
       
      
    106    In subsequent decisions, the Court of Criminal Appeal of the Supreme Court of Western Australia has referred to Verschuren as neither requiring a two stage approach to be adopted, nor holding that it would be an error to fail to adopt such an approach. 
     
      
    107    In Doherty v The Queen (Supreme Court of Western Australia Court of Criminal Appeal, 14 October 1997, unreported). Franklyn J with whom Malcolm CJ and Steytler J agreed emphasised that the quantification of a discount was a matter of discretion. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whether the recognition of such discount is effected by the sentencing Judge specifying its amount, or by specifying an overall deduction for mitigatory matters including such a deduction, or, by informing the offender that an appropriate deduction has been made, or, in some other way that his early plea has been taken into account in fixing the sentence imposed, is an exercise of discretion and so must remain a matter for the individual Judge, as must the extent of the discount he allows.” 
        
       
      
    108    In Scott & Massey v The Queen (Supreme Court of Western Australia Court of Criminal Appeal, 15 January 1999, unreported), Murray J said: 
     
      
       
        
        In  
        Verschuren 
          
        v R 
         (1996) 17 WAR 467 this Court held there was neither an error of principle to adopt a two-stage or two-tiered approach to sentencing, nor to decline to do so. If such an approach is found by a sentencing Judge to be useful in a particular case, then some degree of quantification in broad terms of the impact on the sentencing process of particular matters of aggravation or mitigation may be attempted and might assist to discharge the court’s duty to explain the sentencing process in the particular case, but it cannot be in error to decline to take that approach and it cannot be an error to fail to do so with any mathematical precision. 
        
       
       
        
        In my respectful submission it is particularly important to bear in mind at all times that the act of sentencing is an act of the exercise of judicial discretion of considerable gravity and difficulty.”  
        
       
       
      (See also  
      James v R  
      [2000] WASCA 100 at [52],  
      Dailey v R 
       [2000] WASCA 158 at [5]). 
       
      
    109    The preponderant, but not unanimous view, in the Australian authorities is that it is always permissible and sometimes desirable for a trial judge to quantify the discount accorded for a plea of guilty. Some judges have indicated an opinion that it is usually desirable to do so. Different views are open as shown above.  
     
      
    110    In this respect there is no reason why the position in each State should be the same, particularly with respect to the utilitarian benefits of a plea. The relationship between the demands upon, and the resources available, to the criminal justice system will vary from one State to another. The practice of the criminal bar in advising on such matters will also differ. In this respect, variation of practice is not necessarily undesirable. 
     
      
    111    I note that these proceedings are not concerned with Commonwealth offences and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions did not participate in them. These reasons are not intended to be applicable to Commonwealth offences. 
     
      
    112    In view of the evidence before this Court which establishes that the objective of encouraging early pleas is not being attained, this Court should adopt a guideline designed to ensure that offenders, and those who advise them, will know that in this State a discount for a plea is in fact given on a systematic basis and that the earlier the plea, the greater the benefit. This objective will best be served if sentencing judges adopt the practice of quantifying the discount and relating the quantification in some way to the timing of the plea. This Court should promulgate a guideline which encourages sentencing judges to do this. 
     
      
    113    As Gleeson CJ and Hunt J said in Gallagher it will not always be possible or appropriate to specify a discount for a plea. Whether or not it is possible or appropriate is a matter for the exercise of the discretion of the sentencing judge. This Court should go no further than encouraging judges to do so. For the reasons discussed below, this encouragement particularly relates to the utilitarian benefit of a plea, where it is appropriate to separately deal with that element. This should not inhibit a trial judge, where she or he thinks it appropriate to do so, to take another course, including quantifying a discount for all aspects of a plea. 
     
      
       
      Separate Treatment of Utilitarian Value 
       
      
    114    The Crown and the Attorney both submitted that any quantitative guideline on a discount should encompass all aspects of the sentencing process reflected in the single act of the plea. The Public Defender and counsel appearing for the Respondents submitted that any guideline should be restricted to the utilitarian benefits, leaving the question of remorse or contrition to be dealt with together with other subjective considerations. 
     
      
    115    There is considerable force in the proposition that the combination of utilitarian elements with remorse and witness vulnerability involves the addition of incommensurable factors. The benefits to the criminal justice system as a whole, which flows from a plea of guilty, particularly an early plea of guilty, are not related to the circumstances of the offence or to the conduct of the offender. Such benefits flow from an act by the offender that is not directly related to any of the multifarious objectives designed to be served by the sentencing process: deterrence, rehabilitation, punishment, etc. Rather, they are a collateral benefits for the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system as a whole, which require acknowledgment of some character by way of an incentive, so that the benefits will in fact be derived by the system.  
     
      
    116    The element of remorse which is said to be reflected in a guilty plea and the benefits to witnesses, particularly victims, are of a different quality. Remorse is directly concerned with the circumstances of the offender and may have significant implications for other objectives of the sentencing process. First, genuine remorse would indicate that the element of personal deterrence does not need to be given weight in the particular case. Secondly, it indicates that the prospects of rehabilitation are good. These are sentencing matters pertaining to the individual case, not advantages to the administration of criminal justice. 
     
      
    117    Furthermore the plea is, of itself, equivocal with respect to remorse. A plea may be entered as an acceptance of the inevitable or in order to obtain such advantage as may be afforded in the circumstances. In such a case a plea does not indicate genuine remorse or contrition. Indeed, even a plea of not guilty to a particular offence may be consistent with genuine remorse as to the effect of the offender’s particular conduct, acknowledged to constitute a lesser offence, with respect to which the accused is not, or not then, charged. 
     
      
    118    The bare fact of a plea is, of itself, a very simple expression of remorse. Much greater weight may be accorded to the conduct and statements of an accused over a period of time, which confirm a position of genuine and deeply felt contrition. When such contrition is taken into account by a sentencing judge, then the diminution of sentence is given for contrition, not for the plea of guilty. The plea in such a case is, at most, evidence of remorse or contrition and, often, not the best such evidence. It is not desirable to separate out the factor of a plea as an indication of remorse from other manifestations of remorse. 
     
      
    119    As noted above, a factor identified as a benefit from a plea of guilty is the avoidance of the need for witnesses to give evidence, particularly victims and their families and, especially, sexual assault victims. In Siganto supra at [23], the High Court regarded such benefits as relevant to the aspect of remorse. 
     
      
    120    This is a consideration which varies to a significant degree with the nature of, and circumstances of, an offence. It is often the case that the ordeal of a victim and of his or her family, and the anxiety of independent witnesses, continues until the trial. A plea permits the healing process to commence. A victim does not have to endure the uncertainty of not knowing whether he or she will be believed, nor the scepticism sometimes displayed by friends and even family prior to a conviction. A victim will also be spared the personal rumination of the events - reliving the rape, as it is described in that context. An early plea of guilty minimises these effects. 
     
      
    121    Like the element of remorse, this consideration depends on the specific circumstances of the offence and overlaps to a substantial extent with other aspects of the specific case which are relevant to the sentencing task. 
     
      
    122    These conclusions are reinforced by consideration of the “instinctive synthesis” approach to the sentencing process which has generally been accepted as the appropriate approach. The aspects of the guilty plea that go to remorse and witness vulnerability are much more closely associated with other factors concerning the circumstances of the offender and of the offence, including other evidence relating to contrition, than the element of advantage to the administration of criminal justice. The public interest served by encouraging pleas of guilty for their utilitarian value is a distinct interest. 
     
      
    123    For these reasons I am of the opinion that any general quantitative guideline should focus on the utilitarian advantage derived by the criminal justice system from encouraging pleas of guilty. 
     
      
       
       
      Need for a Quantitative Guideline 
       
      
    124    All parties submitted that this Court should provide an indication as to the appropriate range of discount for a plea off guilty. Like earlier guideline judgments of this Court any such quantification would be by way of guidance only. It would not be binding in any formal sense. 
     
      
    125    The parties who appeared before the Court were unanimous in their support of some such guidance. The principal argument in favour of doing so is the need for consistency in the approach taken by sentencing judges. Because it has not been the practice of sentencing judges to quantify any discount for a plea, it is not possible to establish any pattern of inconsistency, as has been possible in earlier guideline judgments. 
     
      
    126    Nevertheless the scepticism about the benefits of an early plea, which appears to be widespread amongst participants in the New South Wales criminal justice system, does suggest an element of inconsistency. Most significantly, however, the evidence available to this Court indicates that the scepticism is reflected in actual practice: where pleas occur, they tend to be late. One of the reasons for that fact is the scepticism about the benefits in fact afforded. 
     
      
    127    For the reasons I have already advanced, the identification of a quantitative guideline in this specific respect is not necessarily inconsistent with the instinctive synthesis approach to the sentencing task. This is particularly so if this Court lays down a broad range within which sentencing judges can exercise a discretion. 
     
      
    128    Arguments in favour of a recognition of the utilitarian value of a guilty plea were set out by King CJ in The Queen v Shannon (1979) 21 SASR 442 esp at 447-451. Of particular significance, for present purposes, is the passage at 451 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The conditions under which justice is administered change and the emphasis to be placed upon the various purpose to be achieved in shaping sentences changes accordingly. There are features of the current conditions which emphasise the need for practical encouragement for guilty persons to admit their guilt. Legal aid for as many as possible of those charged with serious offences should be a high social priority, and, indeed, it is not too much to say that its availability to persons having a genuine defence to criminal charges is indispensable to the proper administration of justice. The consequences of the general availability of legal aid must, however, be recognized and coped with. It must be recognized that guilty persons can put forward false stories and be defended without cost to themselves. The result is the depletion of funds available for legal aid and congestion and delay in the criminal courts. It is not, generally speaking, for the solicitor assigned or the legal aid authority to judge the truth of the assisted person’s story, and it is only in the exceptional case that it can be proper to refuse or discontinue assistance because of the strength of the prosecution’s case. If a plea of guilty, as distinct from remorse evidence by such a plea, cannot be regarded as a factor in mitigation of penalty, there is no incentive, other than the demands of honesty, for an offender to admit his guilt, and experience indicates that the demands of honesty have but little influence on many of those who appear in the docks of criminal courts. In most cases, if the offender has nothing to gain by admitting his guilt, he will see no reason for doing so. I am impressed by the strong practical reasons for recognising a willingness to co-operate in the administration of justice by pleading guilty as conduct possessing a degree of merit, quite apart from remorse, which can be taken into account in assessing the sentence.” 
        
       
      
    129    In The Queen v Slater (1984) 36 SASR 524 King CJ again emphasised the significance of an early plea. His Honour said at 526: 
     
      
       
        
        “The degree of co-operation in the administration of justice meriting a reduction in sentence is obviously consistently greater in the case of an offender who pleads guilty when he is first arraigned in the court than in the case of an offender who delays his plea of guilty until the morning of the trial when time of the court has been allocated and the witnesses and jurors summoned. I think that it is important, if the practical ends discussed in  
        Shannon 
         are to be served, that sentencing judges should make significant reductions in sentences in recognition of the co-operation in the administration of justice which the plea of guilty manifests and should explain that they are doing so. I think that it is important, too, that the reduction should be graduated according to the stage at which the plea of guilty is entered and should thereby reflect the degree of co-operation in the administration of justice which the offender has shown.” 
        
       
       
      (See also  
      R v Dodge 
       (1988) 34 A Crim R 325 at 331 per Kirby P:  
      R v Bond 
       (1991) 48 A Crim R 1 at 6-7 per Kirby P). 
       
      
    130    The legitimacy of our criminal justice system would be undermined if persons who were not in truth guilty of offences were encouraged to plead guilty. Subject to that constraint, the public interest is well served to a significant degree if persons who are guilty, plead guilty. The earlier they do so, the greater the public benefit. There would be substantial benefit from bringing forward in time the large number of pleas which are first lodged on the opening day of the trial. As noted above, the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research Survey of the District Court found that 60 percent of all guilty pleas were entered on the day of the trial. 
     
      
    131    Every part of the complex web of interconnected participants which comprises the criminal justice system will be improved if a greater number of early pleas could be achieved. The benefits include: 
     
      
    · Reduce congestion in court lists and permit courts to plan the use of limited resources without overlisting and avoiding the waste of trial court time. 
     
      
    · Reduce the waste of the limited resources available to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Public Defender and legal aid, both by the direct saving of time spent on preparing cases that do not proceed and by the indirect saving of reducing the number of cases not reached due to overlisting. 
     
      
    · Reduce the waste of time of witnesses, amongst whom police constitute the largest single category, in preparing to give evidence and, in many cases, appearing on the day of trial. 
     
      
    · Reduce the waste of time of jurors who are needlessly assembled for trial. 
     
      
    132    All of these benefits are significantly attenuated, if not lost, to the extent that pleas occur only on the day of trial. Insofar as such benefits are achieved, they enable the criminal justice system as presently resourced to reduce delays with further attendant advantages. 
     
      
    133    From the utilitarian perspective alone, an early plea offers distinctive and substantially greater benefits over a plea that occurs at the commencement, let alone during, a trial. By the time of the trial considerable expenditure has been incurred by the prosecution and the defence in preparing the case, witnesses and victims are in attendance, a substantial proportion of the cost of the legal aid system has already been incurred and a jury panel has been required for attendance. Furthermore, although backup trials, either criminal or civil, may be available to employ the court’s time made available without notice, that may not always be the case. The frequency with which guilty pleas are made on the day of the trial is a matter which considerably disrupts the efficiency with which courts in New South Wales can plan the use of their resources. The listing of reserve trials can never be precisely accurate. This results on some occasions in adjournments, and consequently waste of resources by the parties, and on other occasions in waste of judicial and court time. 
     
      
    134    The difficulties involved are identified in the Report of the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research Managing Trial Court Delay where the authors say with respect to the New South Wales District Court at p41: 
     
      
       
        
        “Late guilty pleas, adjournments (sought by both the Crown and the Defence) and the failure to reach matters were identified as the primary causes of matters failing to proceed to trial. These three problems do not have their origin in any one source. In responding to the twin problems of late pleas and requests and adjournment, and in being concerned to make maximum use of available court time, the Court has engaged in a policy of over-listing. The over-listing has been such that many matters fail to be reached. Because of the high not-reached rate, the Defence and Prosecution are generally less prepared for trial than they should be on the day of trial. This has further exacerbated the twin problems of late pleas and adjournments. 
        
       
       
        
        These problems have been compounded by lack of early and continuous legal representation for the Defence, lack of early involvement of a senior representative for the Crown, difficulties with Crown witness availability and the lack of a perceived benefit for an early guilty plea. 
        
       
       
        
        The vicious circle just described cannot be broken by changing just one or some of the above condition. If court administrators reduce the over-listing quota to provide greater trial date certainty but nothing is done about the conditions leading to late guilty pleas and adjournments, the result will be a substantial waste of trial court time. If the Defence and the Crown put resources into ensuring early and continuous representation to reduce late pleas and adjournments, and thoroughly prepare those matters still requiring a trial, but the Court continues over-listing, the result will be a vast increase in inefficiency for Defence and Prosecution.” 
        
       
      
    135    In my opinion, the significant public interests served by encouraging early pleas are such as to justify this Court indicating to the participants in the criminal justice system the extent to which benefits will accrue for an early plea, particularly from the perspective of the utilitarian considerations. 
     
      
    136    Separation of the elements of contrition and utilitarian value in the plea of guilty requires a consideration of whether or not the element of strength of the Crown case, to which reference is frequently made as limiting the value of a plea, should be attributed to both of the elements. The Attorney General submitted that the strength of the Crown case should not have any bearing upon the weight to be attributed to that aspect of the discount which is attributed to purely utilitarian considerations. The authorities support this submission. (See R v Slater supra at 525-526; R v Bond supra at 7; R v Winchester supra at 350; R v Bishop (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 23 September 1996, unreported); R v Bulger [1990] 2 Qd R 559 at 564. 
     
      
    137    In R v Winchester Hunt CJ at CL related the strength of the Crown case only to the contrition element of the leniency in sentencing which a plea of guilty affords an accused (c/f R v Beavan supra at 12). As his Honour put it at 350: 
     
      
       
        
        “The extent to which leniency will be afforded upon this ground will depend to a large degree upon whether or not the plea resulted from a recognition of the inevitable.” 
        
       
       
      In my opinion his Honour was correct to link the question of the strength of the Crown case only to the issue of contrition or remorse. A “recognition of the inevitable” may qualify the extent of genuine contrition. It does not qualify the utilitarian value of a plea. 
       
      
    138    The element of the strength of the Crown case varies from one extreme where there is very strong Crown case and the plea simply involves a “recognition of the inevitable”, to the other extreme where, but for admissions made by the accused, the crimes committed would have gone unpunished or, in some circumstances, even undetected. As Street CJ said in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604: 
     
      
       
        
        “This court has said on a number of occasions that a plea of guilty will entitle a convicted person to an element of leniency in the sentence. The degree of leniency may vary according to the degree of inevitability of conviction as it may appear to the sentencing judge, but it is always a factor to which a greater or lesser degree of weight must be given. 
        
       
       
        
        When the conviction follows upon a plea of guilty, that itself is the result of a voluntary disclosure of guilt by the person concerned, a further element of leniency enters into the sentencing decision. Where it was unlikely that guilt would be discovered and established were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence, then a considerable element of leniency should properly be extended by the sentencing judge. It is part of the policy of the criminal law to encourage a guilty person to come forward and disclose both the fact of an offence having been committed and confession of guilt of that offence. 
        
       
       
        
        The leniency that follows confession of guilt in the form of a plea of guilty is a well recognised part of the body of principles that cover sentencing. Although less well recognised, because less frequently encountered, the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency, the degree of which will vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered by the law enforcement authorities, as well as guilt being established against the person concerned.” 
        
       
      
    139    To similar effect in R v Bishop supra Hunt CJ at CL with whom Smart and McInerney JJ agreed said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The degree of contrition evidenced by a plea of guilty depends to a large degree upon whether or not it resulted from a recognition of the inevitable. Where it is unlikely that guilt would have been discovered and established where it not for the prisoner’s disclosures, a considerable degree of leniency will usually be extended to a plea of guilty and to a significant extent. Where guilt would inevitably be discovered and established whatever attitude is adopted by the prisoner, a plea of guilty does not evidence any particular degree of contrition, so that leniency will be extended for the plea of guilty only so far as there is a utilitarian benefit in the savings of the time and cost of a trial. None of this is to say that contrition cannot still be taken into account. All that is said is that the plea of guilty does not evidence such contrition.” 
        
       
      
    140    Where the accused’s own disclosure or confession is the basis of the strong Crown case, this should be taken into account with respect to the utilitarian benefit. Indeed, such conduct should be regarded as the earliest possible timing for a plea. 
     
      
       
      The Extent of Discount 
       
      
    141    Varying submissions were made with respect to the appropriate rate of discount.  
     
      
    142    Mr Nicholson SC, the Public Defender, submitted that an appropriate rate was 20 percent discount for a late plea of guilty. Mr Game SC who appeared for the Respondent Houlton submitted that a 33 percent discount was appropriate for an early plea of guilty. As noted, their submissions did not encompass any aspect of remorse.  
     
      
    143    Mr Buddin SC, who appeared for the Attorney General, submitted that a single discount should be determined for all aspects of a plea. He submitted that, putting aside any question of remorse, a late plea of guilty even in the face of an overwhelming case should attract a discount of 15-20 percent. 
     
      
    144    Mr Berman, who appeared for the Crown, submitted that all of these proposed discounts were too high. He submitted that a level of discount of 25-30 percent was appropriate for an early plea which encompassed all matters, including remorse, with the top of the range restricted to cases with greater than usual benefits e.g. complex and lengthy proceedings. 
     
      
    145    The various submissions identified a range of authorities which suggest that a discount for a plea of guilty has, in a number of jurisdictions, tended to fall in the range of 25 percent to 35 percent.  
     
      
    146    The Court was referred to cases from jurisdictions in which a formal guideline judgment approach has been adopted (see e.g. “one third would very often be an appropriate discount” R v Buffrey (1993) 14 Cr App R (S) 511; “between a one-quarter and one-third” Thomas The Principles of Sentencing 2nd ed at 52). 
     
      
    147    In New Zealand, the Court of Appeal has rejected a uniform minimum discount of 25 percent for an early plea. (The Queen v Liava’a (New Zealand Court of Appeal, 17 August 1998, unreported). The Court has not promulgated any specific quantum or proportion. (See R v Mako [2000] 2 NZLR 170. A review of the New Zealand authorities suggests a range of 10-33 percent, with the most common range being 20-25 percent. (Geoffrey Hall “Sentencing” in Butterworths Current Law par 1.7.3).  
     
      
    148    In Western Australia, at least with respect to sentences under that State’s “fast track system”, the discount is “often” of the order of 20-25 percent to 30-35 percent. (Verschuren supra at 469; R v Miles (1997) 17 WAR 518 at 521). 
     
      
    149    In South Australia a discount of 25 percent for an early plea of guilty has often been referred to. (R v Sutherland supra; R v Nixon (1993) 66 A Crim R 83 at 90; R v Kendall (Supreme Court of South Australia Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 June 1997, unreported); Allen v R [1999] SASC 346). Discounts in the range of 15-25 percent have been described as “quite common”. (R v Rooke supra per Doyle CJ)). 
     
      
    150    All of these cases refer to a discount which did not involve any separation of utilitarian benefits from other considerations. 
     
      
    151    Although these practices, as variously expressed, are suggestive, they are of only limited assistance. This is particularly so if, as proposed, any identified range is limited to the utilitarian value of a plea. That utilitarian value will vary from time to time and from one criminal justice system to another. Obviously there are common elements but there are also differences. The task of this Court is to identify a discount range which is appropriate and which will serve the public interests sought to be attained in New South Wales from encouraging early pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    152    In my opinion, the appropriate range for a discount is from 10-25 percent. 
     
      
    153    The determination of where, within such a range, the discount should fall in a particular case is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    154    There are however two circumstances which will generally affect the appropriate level of discount in a particular case: 
     
      
       
      (i) The time at which a plea is entered. A plea entered at committal has a more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing, which in turn has the greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of trial. 
       
       
      (ii) The complexity of the issues about which evidence will have to be gathered and adduced affects the value of the plea. The greater the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the greater the length and complexity of the trial, the greater the utilitarian value of a plea. 
       
      
    155    The top of the range would be expected to be restricted to pleas at the earliest possible opportunity and should not be given, save in an exceptional case, after a matter has been set down for trial. A discount towards the bottom of the range is appropriate for late pleas, e.g. on the date fixed for trial, unless there are particular benefits arising from the prospective length and complexity of the trial. 
     
      
    156    Rare cases involving exceptional complexity and trial duration may justify a higher discount. In some cases no discount is appropriate at all. In some cases the “discount” will be reflected in a step down in the hierarchy of sentencing options. 
     
      
    157    There are circumstances in which the protection of the public requires a long sentence to be imposed so that no discount for the plea is appropriate. (See e.g. R v Stabler (1984) 6 Cr App R (S) 129 at 131; R v Costen [1989] 11 Cr App R (S) 182 at 184). 
     
      
    158    There are crimes that so offend the public interest that the maximum sentence, without any discount for any purpose, is appropriate. This includes situations in which a life sentence can be and is imposed, notwithstanding the plea. (See e.g. R v Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2, see esp per Sully J at [38]-[42]). 
     
      
    159    It is also pertinent to state that a discount of 10-25 percent is not a range within which trial judges may exercise a discretion that will not be subject to appellate review. Appeals against severity or leniency of sentence focus on the range which is appropriate for the particular case, not on the range appropriate for pleas in the full variety of circumstances. 
     
      
       
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    160    The Court should adopt the following guideline applicable to offences against State laws: 
     
      
       
      (i) A sentencing judge should explicitly state that a plea of guilty has been taken into account. Failure to do so will generally be taken to indicate that the plea was not given weight. 
       
       
      (ii) Sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence insofar as they believe it appropriate to do so. This effect can encompass any or all of the matters to which the plea may be relevant - contrition, witness vulnerability and utilitarian value - but particular encouragement is given to the quantification of the last mentioned matter. Where other matters are regarded as appropriate to be quantified in a particular case, e.g. assistance to authorities, a single combined quantification will often be appropriate. 
       
       
      (iii) The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 percent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea. What is to be regarded as an early plea will vary according to the circumstances of the case and is a matter for determination by the sentencing judge. 
       
       
      (iv) In some cases the plea, in combination with other relevant factors, will change the nature of the sentence imposed. In some cases a plea will not lead to any discount. 
       
      
    161    The Court was asked to clarify its earlier guideline judgments in the light of any guideline it might propose in this respect. The standard case identified in each of Jurisic and Henry included a plea of guilty. That was not the case in Wong in which the range encompassed relevant matters, including a plea. In each of Jurisic at 231 and Henry at [162], the Court was concerned with a guilty plea of limited value. The guidelines for the offences considered in those cases should be understood to involve a late plea of guilty, for purposes of the application of the guideline promulgated in these reasons. 
     
      
    162    The discount range propounded for a guilty plea based on utilitarian considerations is not intended to result in any change in the level of sentences generally. Nothing in these reasons should be construed as indicating an opinion that trial judges have not in fact been giving appropriate consideration and weight to pleas in such a way as to distort the general level of sentences. The purpose of identifying a discount range is to improve the transparency of the process and to alter the widespread perception that there is no benefit from an early plea. Insofar as existing sentencing practice has been to allow discounts for pleas up to 35 percent, encompassing all relevant matters, such a practice remains appropriate. 
     
      
    163    WOOD CJ at CL: I agree fully with the reasons of Spigelman CJ, concerning the desirability of issuing a guideline judgment in this matter, and with the guidelines proposed. I consider these guidelines to properly reflect the mitigating circumstance associated with the utilitarian value of a guilty plea. Adherence to them, in the absence of compelling reason to the contrary, can only assist to secure greater certainty and equity in sentencing practice. 
     
      
    164    FOSTER AJA: I agree with Spigelman CJ. 
     
      
    165    GROVE J: I agree with Spigelman CJ. 
     
      
    166    JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of the Chief Justice.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
       
      
     1     
     THE COURT 
     : On 19 April 1999, the appellant was indicted at the Supreme Court on the following charge: That on 19 May 1990, at Artarmon in the State of New South Wales, he did murder Wayne George Tonks. The appellant pleaded not guilty. On 30 April 1999 the jury returned a verdict of guilty of manslaughter.  
      
       
      
     2     
     The appellant has appealed against the conviction on the following grounds: 
      
       
        
       (1) The trial judge erred in his directions on causation and on the act or acts said to have caused death. 
        
       (2) The trial judge erred in his directions on unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter. 
        
       (3) The trial judge erred in his directions on self defence as it related to manslaughter. 
        
       (4) The trial judge did not adequately or fairly put the defence case. 
        
        
       The Course of the trial 
        
       
      
     3     
     The opening address by the crown prosecutor has not been transcribed, if it was recorded. There is a record in the transcript of the counsel for the appellant having made an opening statement at that stage. Likewise, that has not been transcribed, if it was recorded. It is apparent, however, from the course of the trial that it was the crown’s case that the appellant, with a companion, Peter Clive Kane, went to the deceased’s flat on 19 May 1990 with the intention of killing the deceased; that they took with them a baseball bat, adhesive tape and a plastic bag; that the appellant hit the deceased over the head with the baseball bat and bound the deceased up with the tape; that the plastic bag was put over the deceased’s head and taped tightly around his neck; and that the deceased died from suffocation. The crown was not in a position to prove which of the two assailants put the bag over the deceased’s head or which of them taped the bag around his neck.  
      
       
      
     4     
     Evidence called early in the crown case related to what was found at the crime scene. Constable Kenyan attended the premises on 21 May 1990. The victim’s body was lying on the floor of the lounge room with a plastic bag over his head secured by adhesive tape. The body was also bound by tape at the ankles, knees and hands. Later that day, Detective Keeling attended the scene with Dr Duflou, forensic pathologist. The plastic bag was removed. It then became apparent that the ears, eyes and mouth of the deceased were also bound with the adhesive tape, but not the nose. There was a deep laceration on the right hand side of the victim’s head. Dr Duflou commented further on the plastic bag in his evidence. He said it was tightly secured around the neck at its lowest point.  
      
       
      
     5     
     Dr Duflou said that the deceased died from suffocation. He also said that the blow to the head, evidenced by the laceration, was, in itself, insufficient to cause death. He added, however, that, in his view, it contributed to the death because it made it easier for the bag to be placed over the deceased’s head. We will come to the evaluation of that approach in accordance with legal principle later in this judgment. 
      
       
      
     6     
     At an early stage in the trial, the trial judge properly sought to identify the real issues in the case and to avoid time being taken on matters which were not in dispute. Detective Senior Sergeant Lovie gave evidence that he conducted a fingerprint examination. The trial judge intervened. He said that, as he understood counsel’s opening statement, there was no dispute about fingerprints. Counsel confirmed that this was so. He had already prepared formal admissions in that regard. These were tendered as exhibit G. So far as is presently relevant, these were to the effect that the appellant’s fingerprints were found on the tape attached to the deceased’s ankles, knees, eyes and mouth, but that no fingerprints of the appellant were found on the bag and tape on the deceased’s head. More importantly for present purposes, his Honour observed in the course of discussion about the fingerprints: 
      
       
        
         
         “If the real issue is self-defence, as it looks to be, then let us not take a day arguing about technical evidence and comparative charts and all that sort of thing.” 
         
        
        
       There was no demur by counsel for the appellant to the judge’s suggestion that the real issue was self defence. 
        
       
      
     7     
     Later in the trial, the crown prosecutor indicated that he wished to call Kane and sought an order abridging the time for service of a subpoena. There was apparently then some discussion which has not been fully recorded but as the discussion proceeded, a full record was made (Tr 94): 
      
       
        
         
         “IN THE ABSENCE OF THE JURY 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: The Crown wishes to call Peter Clive Kane, the other accused whose trial is next week in this trial and he has not been subpoenaed. The Crown seeks an order of the Court that a subpoena be issued for this trial and seeks the time for service of this subpoena be abridged. There is a draft order, if your Honour makes the order being sought with a supporting affidavit. Might I tender the draft order, and the supporting affidavit of Mr Higgins. 
         
        
        
         
         BYRNE: My recollection is that I simply said he did not do that physical act. 
         
        
        
         
         DISCUSSION 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I have myself given some consideration understanding what actually might be entailed in the way you opened that part of the defence case yesterday. I took it that you were not disputing that at the very least the present accused was a principal in the second degree in the sense that he was there actively taking part in the total enterprise of which a material segment was the placing, let us assume, over the head of that bag (sic) and it is clear in the way the evidence is - am I misapprehending the way in which the defence is to pan out? 
         
        
        
         
         BYRNE: No your Honour. I used words which - without precisely putting the position of the accused generally covered the situation that he wasn’t the person who actually put the bag - that is what I anticipate he will say. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: But the two of them went there together for a joint purpose. 
         
        
        
         
         BYRNE: Yes I think that is probably right. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: One or other of them struck the blow which caused the head injury which we heard described this morning. Before both of them set upon the victim. They both then set upon him and bound him in a way shown in the photographs and in a unbroken continuum of assault, one or other of them put the bag on his head and secured in such a way that it was inevitable that he would suffocate to death. 
         
        
        
         
         They left him lying on the floor. Nobody raised an alarm. They just left him in that condition. If he is not to be present to be called we won’t have any splitting of the hairs about who was present doing what. 
         
        
        
         
         BYRNE: I feel in a position at the moment to answer that question but I would prefer before answering it to confirm certain things with my client.” 
         
        
       
      
     8     
     The hearing was adjourned until the following morning. When the hearing resumed, the discussion continued (Tr 95-96): 
      
       
        
         
         “BYRNE: So far as the issue that was raised yesterday afternoon is concerned, I do have a copy of the transcript that your Honour’s tipstaff has made available to me first thing this morning. The issues, as I understand them from what your Honour raised yesterday, are, firstly, the evidence that is likely to emerge in the case regarding the placement of the bag on the head of the deceased. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I am assuming that if Mr Kane is called, he will say either that the accused put the bag on the head of the deceased or that they both did. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: He’s going to say “I don’t know”. According to his record of interview with the police, he said “I don’t know who put the bag on his head”. 
         
        
        
         
         BYRNE: If it does go further than that in his record of interview, he was asked the question “Did you, Peter Kane, put the bag on Mr Tonks’ head?”, and he said “I don’t know”, I think the immediately following question was “Did you see Ben Andrew put the bag on his head?”, and he said “No”. 
         
        
        
         
         I don’t know if your Honour has these materials up with you. I understand that my learned friend would be relying on what Mr Kane said in his record of interview, the second of them, and that is my understanding of what he said. 
         
        
        
         
         Can I say this. In conference with the accused before your Honour now,  
         he accepts that he knew the bag was on Mr Tonks’ head when he left the unit.  
          He doesn’t seek to avoid responsibility for the consequences of that knowledge by saying, as he would say, that it wasn’t he who put the bag on Mr Tonks’ head. He says that it was Mr Kane who did that, but he accepts he doesn’t seek to in any way say that that was something that was an act of which he was unaware. So that  
         the responsibility for that action of Mr Kane is one which is carried squarely on his shoulders, and he accepts that position. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown, where do we go from here? 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: That would be sufficient for our purposes. I would not seek to call Mr Kane.  
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: In those circumstances, I think that is pleasing because it would make all sorts of complications for the following trial. Then, we will leave it at that shall we. 
         
        
        
         
         BYRNE: There is one matter, and your Honour will appreciate its a rather difficult position to, in effect, be putting the defence case in the way that it is put here. There is an issue, as I understand it, about which Mr Kane was not questioned and about which he would not be able to give evidence - I’m not sure of the position, it’s certainly not contained in his record of interview - but when the concession is made or the admission is, made perhaps more appropriately, that  
         the accused Benjamin Andrew knew that the bag had been placed on Mr Tonks’ head but he didn’t know because he didn’t actually put it there the extent to which that binding was as tight as it apparently was when it was found, that is in issue.  
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Why? It would be an issue if the suggestion were that the deceased had been strangle (sic) by the tape. Why is it an issue of a context of fact where the accused suffocated because he couldn’t get the bag off his head? 
         
        
        
         
         BYRNE: Your Honour has perhaps answered the question and I don’t need to take it any further, but I felt, with respect, that  
         it’s a matter that my instructing solicitor felt was a matter that should be put in this context. He acknowledges his responsibility for what Peter Kane did in relation to the bag because he was there acting, as it were, in a joint enterprise with him and he accepts the legal responsibility that flows from the act committed by his co-offender. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: In the course of carrying out a joint enterprise. 
         
        
        
       BYRNE: Yes I accept that.” 
        
        
       (Emphasis added)

     Although Kane had said in his record of interview that he did not know who put the bag over the deceased’s head and that he did not see the appellant do so, it was plainly not in the appellant’s interests for Kane to be called. The appellant’s counsel could not be sure what he would say and there was a serious risk that, on this topic or on some other topic, he might well say something prejudicial to the appellant.  
      
       
      
     10     
     The following matters are to be noted in relation to the discussion with counsel. Counsel for the appellant told the judge that the appellant accepted legal responsibility for whatever flowed from the putting of the bag over the deceased’s head, and he agreed that this was so because it was done in the course of a joint enterprise entered into between the appellant and Kane. It did not matter, therefore, which of them did that act. Counsel then drew a distinction between putting the bag over the deceased’s head and the binding being as tight as it apparently was when the deceased was found. He said the appellant knew of the bag over the head but he did not know the extent to which the binding was as tight as it was. The point was made with some hesitancy, as something counsel’s instructing solicitor wanted him to say. The judge suggested that this was not a relevant issue if the deceased suffocated because he could not get the bag off his head. Counsel’s response was non-committal. Whether there was a relevant distinction to be drawn between the bag being over the head and the bag being bound tightly around the neck was left open at this stage.  
      
       
      
     11     
     Detective Sergeant Yeomans was the last witness in the crown case. In cross-examination, counsel sought to adduce evidence from him in relation to the deceased’s lifestyle. This was objected to. The trial judge allowed the evidence. In the course of a judgment in that regard, given on 12 April 1999, the trial judge again conveyed his understanding of the issues in the case: 
      
       
        
         
         “As far as I am concerned, the issue in this trial is whether the accused acted in self defence, in the sense, and in the very particular sense, recognised by the law; or whether he did what he unquestionably did under the impetus of provocation, in the sense, and the very particular sense recognised by the law. 
         
        
        
         
         So that there will be no mistake about the matter I indicate at once that I do not imply by what I have said any reversal of the onus of proof or anything of that kind. I say, simply, that in the real world the issues that the jury are going to have to decide are those issues of self defence and provocation.” 
         
        
        
       Counsel did not demur to these observations. 
        
       
      
     12     
     The appellant gave evidence in his own case. He gave evidence of an alleged prior sexual assault by the deceased on him, and of going to the deceased’s flat with Kane to confront the deceased about that. When the appellant came to give evidence concerning the episode on 19 May 1990, he said that he saw Kane put the bag over the deceased’s head and that he personally accepted responsibility for that, but he did not see tape being placed around the deceased’s neck and he did not know that that had been done by Kane. The following is an extract from his evidence in chief (Tr 205): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did you put the bag over his head? 
          
         A. No. 
          
          
         Q. Do you know who did? 
          
         A. Peter placed the bag over his head. 
          
          
         Q. Did you see him do that? 
          
         A. I saw Peter pull the bag onto Mr Tonks’ head. 
          
          
         Q. Did you do anything when you saw Peter Kane do that? 
          
         A. No, I didn’t. 
          
          
         Q. Did you see whether Peter Kane did anything after he pulled the bag over Mr Tonks’ head? 
          
         A. No, I didn’t. I saw Peter pull the bag over his head. 
          
          
         Q. Did you leave the unit after that? 
          
         A. A short time after, yes. 
          
          
         Q. Did you say anything to Peter Kane? 
          
         A. No. 
          
          
         Q. What did you think when you saw the bag placed on Mr Tonks’ head? 
          
         A. I thought Peter was just giving him the fright of his life. 
          
          
         Q. Do you know that there was tape placed around Mr Tonks’ neck? 
          
         A. I didn’t. I didn’t know that at the time. 
          
          
         Q. Was there anything else that you did in the unit before you left the unit that you remember? 
          
         A. We couldn’t get out of the unit. It was deadlocked and I took some time to locate the keys to that deadlock, and when I did, we left.” 
         
        
        
       And (Tr 206): 
        
         
         “Q. Mr Andrew, you said that  
         you knew that Peter Kane had placed this plastic bag on Mr Tonks’ head. Do you personally accept responsibility for that action 
         , even though it was not you who personally placed the bag there? 
          
         A. Yes, I do.” 
         
        
       
      
     13     
     The following is an extract from the appellant’s evidence in cross-examination (Tr 237): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. You didn’t put the bad on his head? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You didn’t see Peter Kane do that? 
          
         A. I saw Peter put the bag on his head, yes. 
          
          
         Q. Who bound his neck? 
          
         A. I accept now that Peter did, but I didn’t see it being taped up at all. 
          
          
         Q. But you saw, before you left the unit, that his head was in the plastic bag? 
          
         A. I saw Peter put the - pull the bag over his head, yes. 
          
          
         Q. You saw, before you left the flat, the unit, that his head was in the bag? 
          
         A. Yes. 
          
          
         Q. You knew once he was bound up that he could not have been any further threat to you? 
          
         A. That’s right. 
          
          
         Q. What was the reason for, do you know, of putting the bag over his head? 
          
         A. I do not. 
          
          
         Q. Peter didn’t say anything to you like “I’m going to put the bag over his head?” 
          
         A. No. 
          
          
         Q. You knew that he would suffocate once the bag was over his head didn’t you? 
          
         A. No. I thought that he would rub his head on the carpet and free himself from the bag. 
          
          
         Q. Well, why didn’t you go over and take the bag from his head when you saw the bag on his head? 
          
         A. I just wanted to get out of there. I wish I had have. 
          
          
         Q. The bag was secured to his neck with more tape. Did you see Peter Kane putting tape around his neck? 
          
         A. No, I did not. 
          
          
         Q. Obviously that took some time to put the tape around his neck. What were you doing? 
          
         A. (Witness nodded.) 
          
          
         HIS HONOUR: Q Is the answer to that question yes? 
          
         A. Yes, it would have put a time to put the tape on. 
          
          
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. What were you doing? 
          
         A. I was searching for the keys to the front door which was deadlocked, and eventually I found them and opened the door and we left.” 
         
        
       
      
     14     
     The following is an extract from the appellant’s evidence, given in answer to questions by the trial judge (Tr 245): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. The only other thing I wanted to ask was this, at what stage in the course of events did you last cast a glance in the direction of Mr Tonks lying on the floor. 
          
         A. Can you repeat that for me your Honour? 
          
          
         Q. At what stage in the course of events in the flat on the second visit and before you found his keys did you last cast a glance in the direction of Mr Tonks lying on the floor? 
          
         A. I last cast a glance at Mr Tonks lying on the floor when I saw Peter pull the bag over his head at which stage I was standing at the front door, in that area looking for the keys, and Mr Tonks was here (indicated) and Peter was here (indicated) facing him, pulling the bag onto his head. 
          
          
         Q. And about how far away from you was Mr Tonks lying on the floor? 
          
         A. Approximately from here to the start of the dock, your Honour (indicated 30 feet). 
          
          
         Q. And last thing you saw was Mr Kane pulling the bag over Mr Tonks’ head, is that right? 
          
         A. That is right, your Honour.” 
          
         
        
       
      
     15     
     A distinction now was clearly being made between the appellant seeing the bag being placed over the deceased’s head and the appellant seeing the bag being taped by Kane or having been so taped. The appellant’s acceptance of responsibility (whatever that meant) related to the bag being placed on the deceased’s head. It did not relate in terms to the bag being taped. Whether that mattered was not made clear at this stage.  
      
       
      
     16     
     Before counsel closed the case for appellant, there was discussion between the trial judge, the crown prosecutor and counsel for the appellant (Tr 247-254). His Honour told counsel that he proposed to provide the jury with what he described as a “written index”, formulating the questions which the jury had to resolve. His Honour went on to say (Tr 252): 
      
       
        
         
         “I think that to sit up in front of the jury and to say in narrative form “The material ingredients of the crime of murder are one, two and three” is likely to confuse rather than to assist them. I prefer to put into their hands a document that says “Question one: Has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased died on or about such a date? If so, question two: Has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the cause of the death was suffocation?” - which will be the case here - “If so, question 3: Has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the act which brought about the death was the act of the accused”, and so on and so on.” 
         
        
       
      
     17     
     In substance, these were the first three questions which his Honour later put to the jury as being what they had to decide. His Honour then went on to outline the questions and commentary which he intended to put in the document relating to self defence and provocation.  
      
       
        
       The crown prosecutor’s final address 
        
        
       
      
     18     
     The crown prosecutor addressed on the basis that it was common ground that the appellant was guilty of murder, subject only to the issues of self defence and provocation. The crown prosecutor did not say so in terms. However, this was the clear implication of his approach. We provide the following extract from the transcript of the crown prosecutor’s address (Tr 256): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         As you have been made well aware, the accused is charged with the murder of Wayne Tonks on 19 May 1990 at Artarmon. The accused, it is alleged against him, went to those premises on that date 19 May 1990, with the man Peter Kane, and with Peter Kane killed the deceased man Wayne Tonks; that when they killed him, they had the intent to kill him, they deliberately killed him. They had the intent to kill him. 
         
        
        
         
         You might not have much difficulty in finding that both men killed Mr Tonks. It was put to the accused - when he was giving his evidence, this was by his counsel: 
         
        
        
         
         “Q. Mr Andrew, you said that you knew that Peter Kane has placed this plastic bag on Mr Tonks’ head. Do you personally accept responsibility of that action, even though it was not you who personally placed the bag there? 
          
         A. Yes, I do.” 
         
        
        
         
         In view of that concession, members of the jury, you might not have much doubt that the accused was as responsible as Peter Kane, on the accused’s contention, as to the event that occurred of the crime of murder.” 
          
         
        
       (The transcript of the crown prosecutor’s address does not incorporate the whole of the question and answer quoted by him. We have incorporated it above.)  
        
       
      
     19     
     A little later, when dealing with the evidence relating to character, the crown prosecutor said (Tr 259): 
      
       
        
         
         “Well we know members of the jury, that he accepts the responsibility for the death of Mr Tonks.” 
         
        
        
       The implication was that this was so, subject to what was truly in issue, self defence and provocation. 
        
       
      
     20     
     The crown prosecutor queried the reliability of the appellant’s evidence in relation to the alleged prior sexual assault. He suggested that the appellant had been a willing participant in what, if anything, had previously occurred between the appellant and the deceased. He invited the jury to find that the appellant and Kane had gone to the deceased’s home intent on doing violence to him. He queried whether the deceased provoked the attack. He suggested that the violent behaviour was all one way: the blow to the head, the trussing up, the terrorising. He submitted that the bag was put over the deceased’s head for only one reason, and that was to kill him. He again suggested that the appellant and Kane went to the deceased’s flat to kill him. All these matters went to self defence and provocation. In the balance of his address, the crown prosecutor dealt explicitly with these issues. He dealt with each of the sub-issues which arose in connection with them, in detail and with references to the evidence. 
      
       
        
       Counsel for appellant’s final address 
        
        
       
      
     21     
     In his address, counsel for the appellant made submissions in answer to the attack on the appellant’s reliability as a witness and in support of the appellant’s account of events leading up to the assault on the deceased. 
      
       
      
     22     
     He went on to submit that the jury would not find that the appellant had the specific intent necessary to establish the crime of murder (Tr 288-9): 
      
       
        
         
         “(O)n all the evidence that you could not reach the conclusion that when he was there he had an intention to kill Mr Tonks or to inflict grievous bodily harm on him. It was patently clear that he wanted to hurt him. It was patently clear that he wanted to subject him to some real pain, but not inflict, what the law regards as grievous bodily harm, and certainly not to kill him …[I]f Ben Andrew had wanted to kill Mr Tonks then he would have done it. He would either have bashed him to death, as it were, with the weapon that he had or he would have used that tape in a manner which ensured that he would die.  
         
        
        
         
         All of the evidence that you have is completely to the contrary. He used the baseball bat - the miniature baseball bat in a way that stunned him. It was a savage assault, not one intended to kill, and he used the tape deliberately in a way that would enable him, as he said, to breathe. That is anything but an intention to kill somebody.” 
         
        
        
       The submission went to whether the appellant should be convicted of murder, absent self defence and provocation.  
        
       
      
     23     
     Following some discussion, not presently relevant, the trial was adjourned for the weekend, to be resumed on the following Tuesday. The record on resumption of the trial shows that the trial judge had sent a draft of his proposed written directions (a “general principles of law index”, as the trial judge called it) to the crown prosecutor and counsel for the appellant over the weekend. Counsel for the appellant had raised some objections. The trial judge said he would revise the document. 
      
       
      
     24     
     Counsel for the appellant now resumed his address. He took up his previous theme. He again submitted that the appellant’s conduct on the day did not establish an intention to kill. He submitted that the jury should accept the appellant’s evidence that he did not see the tape on the bag. Death was unintended, he said. 
      
       
      
     25     
     Counsel also argued for self defence, submitting that the appellant’s conduct was motivated by a perceived need to protect himself. He returned to specific intent. He said (Tr 296): 
      
       
        
         
         “If you are satisfied that there is no intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, then you would not be satisfied that he was guilty of murder.” 
         
        
       
      
     26     
     Counsel then submitted that the jury would not find the appellant guilty of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. 
      
       
      
     27     
     Counsel again returned to specific intent. He asked the jury to accept that the accused thought that putting the bag over the deceased’s head would serve only to frighten him. The appellant thought, he said, that the bag was not bound at the neck and that air would flow in and out of the bag from under his chin. Counsel invited the jury to find that what the appellant said about his belief at that time might be true. 
      
       
      
     28     
     Counsel then said that the appellant had accepted only moral responsibility for the bag being put over the deceased’s head. He said (Tr 298): 
      
       
        
         
         “The first thing is that it is true to say that Ben Andrew has acknowledged his responsibility for what Peter Kane did in placing the bag over the head of Mr Tonks.  
         He is not seeking to escape the moral blame. He’s acknowledged that he’s morally responsible, but moral responsibility and criminal guilt are different things. 
          He may be at fault. He may be responsible, but that doesn’t make him guilty of the crime that he’s charged with: Murder or manslaughter. Those are two distinctly different things. There is his moral responsibility for what happened and the question of criminal guilt.  
         The question of moral responsibility has been decided long ago. It will never be changed. He will always regard himself that way. The question of criminal guilt is another question altogether. 
          That is the decision you have to make.” 
         
        
        
       This was different from what counsel had said to the trial judge in the course of earlier discussion, namely, that the appellant accepted  
       legal 
        responsibility for the bag being placed over the deceased’s head.  
        
       
      
     29     
     The address was a radical change of position by counsel for the appellant. He had previously acquiesced in the position that the only live issues were self defence and provocation. Now he invited the jury to acquit the appellant of murder because the appellant did not have the requisite specific intent, and to acquit of both murder and manslaughter because the appellant did not know of the act causing death, namely, the taping of the bag at the neck. These submissions were independent of any question of self defence or provocation. Indeed, there was scant reference to self defence in the address and none to provocation.  
      
       
        
       Discussion before summing up 
        
        
       
      
     30     
     Nothing was said, at this stage, by the crown prosecutor or the trial judge about the change of position by counsel for the appellant. There was a further short reference to the proposed written directions. The judge deferred providing the jury with the written directions at this stage because of objections raised by counsel for the appellant.  
      
       
      
     31     
     It appears that the communications out of court between the trial judge, the crown prosecutor and counsel for the appellant and such discussion as there was in court with regard to the proposed written directions related to the form of the questions his Honour intended to put to the jury, rather than to the way the crown put its case and the questions that flowed from that. The basis, in fact and law, on which the crown put its case, absent self defence and provocation, was not settled before the summing up.  
      
       
        
       The summing up  
        
        
       The summing up was given over a period of three day, broken by discussion with counsel in relation to a variety of topics. 
        
        
       Tuesday, 27 April 1999 
        
       
      
     32     
     Following preliminary instructions of a general nature, the trial judge posed a series of questions for the jury’s consideration. The first question was: Has the crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the victim Wayne George Tonks died on 19 May 1990? The judge said he assumed that that would be answered affirmatively.  
      
       
      
     33     
     The trial judge then posed, as the second question for the jury: Has the crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the cause of his death was suffocation? His Honour referred to the evidence, concerning the blow to the head delivered by the appellant and to the evidence of Dr Duflou in that regard (Tr 40-41): 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did you come to an opinion as to the cause of the deceased’s death? 
          
         A. Yes I did. I concluded that the cause of death was suffocation and I further concluded that the head injury contributed to death but did not directly cause it.  
          
          
         Q. What do you mean by that? 
          
         A. The head injury would almost certainly have stunned the person, if not made the person unconscious. As a result of this stunning or causing of loss of consciousness, any further action for instance placing gags or suffocating the person - by placing the plastic bag over the head would have been easier so in that way it contributed to death. It did not contribute to death for instance causing extensive bleeding or causing a fatal head injury.” 
         
        
       
      
     34     
     His Honour went on to say (summing up 52): 
      
       
        
         
         “So that is the evidence, suffocation, the cause.  
         The head injury capable of contributing to the death  
         in the way described in the answer I latterly read to you but not itself the primary cause of death. So much for question 2.”  
         
        
       
      
     35     
     The reference to the head injury moved into the area of the next question, question 3, introducing an issue as to whether the blow to the head caused the deceased’s death by suffocation. His Honour posed the next question, question 3, as follows: Has the crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that such suffocation was caused by the act of the accused? In relation to that question, his Honour directed the jury as follows (summing up 52-54): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         That is a matter which will require some fairly careful consideration by you . First of all  
         what is the act that caused the death of the accused by suffocation?  
          Was it only the act of the placing by Mr Kane of the plastic bag over the head of the accused (sic) or was it that action combined with the undoubted fact that at the time when the bag was placed over Mr Tonks’ head he was lying on the floor of his living room  
         secured 
           
         at the ankles, the knees, the hands, the mouth and the eyes  
         by that vivid green industrial strength tape. 
         
        
        
         
         And he had, on the bulge of his 
           
         head 
         ,  
         a wound 
          the force of which had caused not only the tearing of the skin that Dr Duflou described in the passages that I latterly read to you but also caused a bruising, admittedly in two small areas, to the various surfaces as described by the doctor, of the brain. Let us assume for the moment and in the accused’s favour that the view that you take was that the act causing death was the act of putting the bag over the head of the dead man. 
         
        
        
         
         Let me rather say: putting the bag over the head of Mr Tonks as he lay on the ground. I did not mean to convey that he was dead at the time. 
         
        
        
         
         That takes, I would suppose,  
         the view of the facts most favourable to the accused. 
          And it sets aside for the purpose of discussion Dr Duflou’s view that the blow to the head, although it could not in itself have been fatal, could well have contributed in the sense described as I read to you a moment ago. On the view most favourable to the accused that the act of suffocation was the pulling the bag over the head of the man as he lay in that condition on the ground, is it open to you to find that the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the act was the act of the accused? 
         
        
        
         
         You will recall that the accused during his evidence was asked about  
         this question of responsibility 
         , for that final act which brought about in time the suffocating of Mr Tonks. Once again there are only five lines of it but I want to give it to you in the words of the accused itself so it would not be said later that what you got was some version which did not do justice to what he in fact had said. (Transcript page) 206: I will lead into it with a question which I take from around line 30 on that page. Again these are questions put to the accused by his own senior counsel. He was asked: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           “Q. You said that you struck Mr Tonks after he placed a video cassette in the video cassette recording machine? 
            
           A. Yes, he was about to push it into the video as I hit him. 
            
            
           Q. Mr Andrew, you said that you knew that Peter Kane had placed this plastic bag on Mr Tonks’ head. Do you personally accept responsibility for that action even though it was not you who personally placed the bag there? 
            
           A. Yes I do.” 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         It is an important point ladies and gentlemen. I don’t think there is any other place where that question of responsibility is placed certainly in - it may have been - I think what I read is as much as was said about it - but it is an important point if counsel wish to - …” 
         
        
        
         
         (Emphasis added.) 
         
        
       
      
     36     
     We will come shortly to what then passed between the trial judge and counsel. First, we make the following observations about the foregoing directions. His Honour began by posing the question as to what was the act that caused the death of the deceased by suffocation. This opened up, as a question for the jury, whether the blow to the head and the immobilisation of the deceased - both of which were acts of the appellant himself - could be regarded as the cause of the deceased’s death. His Honour linked that question with the appellant’s evidence about responsibility.  
      
       
      
     37     
     The burden of this part of the summing up was this. Assuming in the appellant’s favour that it was Kane who did the final act resulting in death, the appellant’s acts or one of them - striking the deceased on the head and trussing up the deceased - might nonetheless be found to be  
     the 
      cause of death.  
      
       
      
     38     
     No other instruction was given concerning the way causation was to be resolved according to legal principles.  
      
       
      
     39     
     Immediately following the foregoing passage in the summing up, counsel for the appellant objected to what the trial judge had said about the view most favourable to the accused being that the act causing death was the act done by Kane of placing the bag over the deceased’s head. Counsel said there was a fundamental distinction between placing the bag over the head and tying the bag around the neck. (He meant “taping”.) This was in the presence of the jury. His Honour called on the crown prosecutor, who read part of the cross-examination of the appellant which we have quoted, being the passage where the appellant said he saw Kane put the bag over the deceased’s head but that he did not see the bag being taped. His Honour resumed the summing up, saying that he was not suggesting that the evidence established that the appellant taped the bag in place or that the appellant saw that being done by Kane. This, however, did not alter the thrust of what his Honour had said about the way in which it was open to the jury to find that the appellant’s own act or acts constituted  
     the 
      cause of suffocation and death.  
      
       
      
     40     
     His Honour then told the jury how they might find the appellant guilty as a principal in the second degree. This related to the appellant’s potential responsibility for what Kane did. The passage in the summing up is as follows (summing up 55-59): 
      
       
        
         
         “What I am saying to you is that, irrefutably, it is evidence out of his own mouth that he saw the bag being pulled over the head, and for myself I don’t know how one could put the facts in a way more favourable to him than that, in other words than by limiting his knowledge to knowledge of the fact that the bag was being pulled over this man’s head by Peter Kane and nothing more. That is what I meant when I said one can take a view most favourable to him by saying that his only knowledge of the bagging of Mr Tonks’ head was as seen as he admits he did see his friend Peter Kane actually pulling it over him. 
         
        
        
         
         There is more. You were asked to bear in mind that there is a difference, as there most certainly is, between what one might call, in ordinary English expression, moral responsibility for an act and criminal culpability for the same act. Let there be no mistake about it. There is a complete dichotomy between those two notions. 
         
        
        
         
         Well, what I am about to put to you in connection with this third question has nothing to do with moral responsibility, it has to do with the view that the law takes of facts as I have sketched them for you; in other words, the view that the law takes of a situation in which one person pulls the bag over the head of the deceased man and the other does not pull the bag over or do anything else with the bag, but sees that the other is doing the pulling. That’s the situation to which I’m addressing what follows. 
         
        
        
         
         Beyond any question, you might think - although it is a question for you only of course - these two young men went to the unit by prior arrangement. Nobody suggests otherwise. You might think, but it is a matter for you, that part of the prior arrangement, on the view most favourable to the accused, was that the accused was going, as he, himself, put it, verbally to abuse the deceased man; but that if it became necessary to protect himself, he was prepared, as he put it, to hit him, and for that purpose took the mini bat with him, baseball bat with him. What happened in the unit, you might think, was something that involved, from first to last, the two young men who had gone in company for that very purpose of confronting - I don’t say of killing - of confronting verbally, to say the very least, the dead man. 
         
        
        
         
         If two people go on such an errand and one of them pulls a plastic bag over the head of a man in the condition of Mr Tonks, as the evidence undisputed, describes that condition, then obviously the person who does the pulling is what the law calls “a principal in the first degree”. He is, that is to say, the person who actually does the act. If the act brings about the death of the person to whom it is done, he, the principal in the first degree, is exactly that, he is the person primarily liable for the consequences of what he did. 
         
        
        
         
         But his friend who is there when he does it, 
           
         who sees what he is doing, who has an opportunity to intervene and to stop what is going on and who elects not to do that, is what the law calls “a principal in the second degree”; that is to say, although he does not do the primary act himself, he knows it is being done and he gives, either expressly or by implication from the way in which he speaks and acts, assent and encouragement to what is being done. In that event, he is as liable as the person who actually pulled the plastic bag onto the head of the man. It isn’t a question of fine philosophical distinction based on the loose concept of moral responsibility, it’s a straight question of law. In such a situation as I have described, both are liable: The one because he did the act; the other because his behaviour was of such a character as to lend assent and support and encouragement to what was being done. 
         
        
        
         
         Now, those are directions of law, and it is for you to apply them to the facts as you find them.  
         
        
        
         
         One fact that you might think you could find without any difficulty at all, but it is a matter for you, is that, in fact, Peter Kane pulled the bag over the head of Mr Tonks as he lay on the ground and in the condition that has been described to you earlier this afternoon. Another fact that you might think you can find, for it is a fact established clearly out of the mouth of the accused himself, is that he saw the bag being pulled over the head of the deceased man. He says it in plain terms in the passages that I have read to you. 
         
        
        
         
         As I understand the evidence, and I’ll be corrected if I am mistaken, - and if I am mistaken I will administer the necessary correction to you, - the evidence does not suggest impediment to the accused of having been able, had he wished to do it, to protest to Peter Kane. You might think that, but it’s a matter for you, they were standing fairly close together in what I described this morning as an average size living room and an average size dining area in an average kind of suburban unit block. Do you think that on the evidence such as it is, it is fair to find that the accused saw what Peter Kane was doing and was content to let him do it; at least to the extent of pulling the bag over the man’s head? 
         
        
        
         
         I say again, that assumes in his favour that he is to be believed when he says that he did not see Peter Kane tape up the bag. I say nothing about that, except to remind you that that is an issue of fact that you must resolve. 
         
        
        
         
         The accused has given you sworn evidence to the effect that he did not, at any time, see Peter Kane tape up the neck of the bag. He has given sworn evidence to the effect that he did not ever see before he left the unit that, in fact, such tape had been applied to the neck of the bag. It is a matter for you as to whether or not you believe that version of events that the accused has given you. And I say nothing about that, for it is a question for you and not for me. If you don’t believe him, then the principles of law, as I have explained them to you, cut in, if I may put it that way, in a much more sharp and precise way. 
         
        
        
         
         But if you do believe him, if you are prepared to give him the benefit of any doubt that you might have as to whether or not he saw the tape put in position, there is no denying, on his own version, that he saw the bag put on; and if you think that it’s fair to assume that he implicitly assented to that happening, then I tell you as a matter of law he is as guilty of the consequences and as responsible for the consequences as if he had been the person who had primarily put the bag in position.” 
         
        
        
         
         (Emphasis added.) 
         
        
       
      
     41     
     The only acts mentioned in this passage were those of Kane, the bag over the head and the taping of the bag. That is to be expected. The passage had, as its central objective, a direction to the jury as to how the appellant might be held liable in law for acts done by Kane. There was no implied withdrawal, therefore of the earlier direction that the appellant’s own acts - the blow to the head and the trussing up - were in the ring for consideration, along with Kane’s acts, as  
     the 
      cause of death.  
      
       
      
     42     
     We need not stop to examine the directions given by the trial judge concerning the legal test for liability of a secondary party as a principal in the second degree. No criticism was made of his Honour’s directions in that regard either at the trial or on appeal.  
      
       
        
       Following that part of the summing up, objections were raised by counsel for the appellant. Relevantly, objection was taken to the directions in relation to the third question formulated by the trial judge. It is unnecessary to specify the objections here. The discussion with counsel extended into the following day. 
        
        
       Wednesday, 28 April 1999 
        
       
      
     43     
     When the summing up resumed, the trial judge provided the jury with a document which included the following questions: 
      
       
        
         
         “Question 1 
          
         Has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the victim, Wayne George Tonks died on 19 May 1990? If so, then: 
         
        
        
         
         Question 2: 
          
         Has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the cause of his death was suffocation? If so, then: 
         
        
        
         
         Question 3: 
          
         Has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that such suffocation was caused by the act of the accused? ….” 
         
        
       
      
     44     
     The trial judge now revisited the third question. He said (pages 92-96): 
      
       
        
         
         “It is appropriate now that you have the document to go to question 3 and to think a little more particularly about some matters arising in connection with that question. 
         
        
        
         
         Bound up in question 3, as I have set it out for you, is what I might call a “sub-question”; that is to say, if you are satisfied that the cause of death was suffocation, that is to say the primary cause of death was suffocation,  
         what do you find to have been the act that caused the suffocation? 
         
        
        
         
         It is possible to answer that question in a number of ways. One can answer it by saying that the act that caused the suffocation was the act of putting the bag over the head of the dead man. One can say that the act causing death was the act of putting the bag over the deceased’s head and then securing it in place with the green industrial strength tape that you will see fixed in that position in the relevant photograph among the photographs making up exhibit M. 
         
        
        
         
         One can answer the question that the cause of death was the act of putting the bag over the deceased man’s head at a time when he was suffering the effects of the blow described in part of Dr Duflou’s evidence that we looked at yesterday, and when he was otherwise immobilised by the liberal application to his ankles, his hands, his mouth and his eyes of that industrial strength green tape. Or, one can take the view that the act causing death was the act of putting the bag over the deceased’s man’s head when he was in that condition and then taping it in position.  
         
        
        
         
         It is important for you to answer, in connection with question 3, what I have thus described as the first sub-question, so to speak, that arises in connection with question 3. 
         
        
        
         
         When you have done that, then it is necessary for you to ask the second sub-question, if I may so describe it, that is bound up in question 3; and that is whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the act that caused the suffocation, however you find it on the evidence; was the act of the accused, either in the sense that he actually did it himself, or in the sense which I explained to you yesterday, and need not repeat, that although he did not do it himself, he was party to it. 
         
        
        
         
         His case is that he saw Peter Kane pull the bag over the head of the deceased. His case is that he thought that if that is all that happened, there was nothing to stop the deceased breathing, because if all that happened was that the bag was pulled over his head, then, notwithstanding, with his then condition, with his head wound and his industrial taped limbs, eyes and mouth, he would have been capable of surviving on the air that he drew in under the edges, as it were, of the bag on his head. 
         
        
        
         
         His case is that what really caused the death was not the placing of the bag on the head, but the placing of the bag on the head and its then taping into position in the way that you see in the relevant photograph in exhibit M. 
         
        
        
         
         His case is that he did not see Peter Kane apply that tape. His case is that not only did he not see Peter Kane apply the tape, he did not see the tape in position, ever. 
         
        
        
         
         The question for you, as we discussed yesterday, comes down in the end to, and yet again, and not for the last time in this discussion that we are having: Do you believe him? Do you believe that he saw the bag being pulled over the head, but did not see the tape being applied? Do you believe that 
           
         if he didn’t see the tape being applied, he didn’t see it at any time after it had been applied? 
         
        
        
         
         You will have to test that as best you can, having regard to the things that we discussed yesterday; having regard, that is to say, to the view that you formed of his credibility; to the view that you formed of him when you saw and heard him give evidence in the witness box; to the questions of space and distance that we discussed yesterday. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Then, as I say, having satisfied yourselves as to what act causing suffocation the Crown has actually established, you must ask whether you are satisfied that that act, as you have found it, is an act, is one for which the accused is liable, that is to say  
         legally liable 
         , either 
          because he did the act himself 
         , or because he gave his assent and encouragement in the act in the way that I discussed with you yesterday. That is what I want to say about question 3.” 
         
        
        
         
         (Emphasis added.) 
         
        
       
      
     45     
     The main focus of this passage was Kane’s acts and how the appellant might be held responsible for them. But it was made clear at the end of the passage, by the words we have emphasised, that the accused’s own acts were not withdrawn as being available for consideration as  
     the 
      cause of death.  
      
       
      
     46     
     At the conclusion of the summing up, counsel for the appellant asked the judge to discharge the jury, or to withdraw his summing up, or to redirect the jury in a number of respects which it is unnecessary to review. 
      
       
      
     47     
     In the course of the application by counsel for the appellant, the crown prosecutor also asked for the jury to be discharged. He said he had been led to believe that the only live issues were self defence and provocation, that he had refrained from calling Kane as a witness on that basis, that he had cross-examined the appellant on that basis, and that he had addressed on that basis. This was plainly correct, but the trial judge took the view - as he was entitled to do - that the crown prosecutor was put on notice of the change of position by counsel for the appellant while the appellant was in the witness box. 
      
       
      
     48     
     The discussion with counsel extended into the following day. 
      
       
      
     49     
     Having declined to discharge the jury on either application, the trial judge agreed to supplement his summing up in response to some of the points raised by counsel for the appellant.  
      
       
        
       Thursday 29 April 1999 
        
       
      
     50     
     When the summing up was resumed, his honour said to the jury (summing up 173-6): 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         I don’t want to correct anything that I said you yesterday 
         , but I do want to correct something that I said to you, one or two things that I said to you, on Tuesday afternoon, for I don’t want there to be any confusion as to these directions; and in particular, I don’t want what I said to you yesterday, by way of directions on question three, to be confused, or otherwise to miscarry by reason of what was said on Tuesday. 
         
        
        
         
         Let me begin by saying this. On Tuesday, I told you on two or three occasions in a comparatively short part of the summing-up that a particular available view of the facts might be thought to be a view that put the facts at their most favourable in the accused’s interest; or that they were - that so to state the matters, was to state them in the way most favourable to the accused. You should disregard all of those references to the view most favourable to the accused. I did not put correctly what I was trying to get at with you with regard to those comments, and you should disregard them 
         
        
        
         
         I told you in particular that on the view most favourable to the accused, that the act of suffocation was pulling the bag over the head of a man as he lay in that condition on the ground. It is open to you to find that the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the act was the act of the accused. I think that what I’m about to say was sufficiently covered yesterday, but, lest there be any doubt about it, let me say it again.  
         
        
        
         
         The clear evidence of Dr Duflou is that the primary cause of death was suffocation.  
         It is a question for you 
          in connection with the question numbered 3 on the document  
         how the act which brought about the suffocation is properly to be defined 
         ; and that involves, as I told you yesterday, a decision, a finding of fact by you. 
         
        
        
         
         It is open to you find, if you are persuaded to do beyond reasonable doubt, persuaded by the Crown to do it beyond reasonable doubt, that the act that caused the suffocation was the act of putting the bag over the head of the deceased, without more. It is possible for you to take the view on the evidence that the act of suffocation was the combined effect of the placing of the bag on the head and its securing in place by the green tape, that you will see in the relevant photograph forming part of exhibit M. Once you have decided  
         how, as you find the facts, the act causing suffocation is correctly to be defined, 
          it then becomes necessary for you, in the way I tried to describe to you yesterday, to decide whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that that act, as you have defined it, is properly to be regarded as the act of the accused, and an act of the accused for which he is criminally responsible in accordance with the directions in that behalf that I gave you over the past couple of days.  
         
        
        
         
         The accused’s case, as I reminded you yesterday, but it will bear repeating, is that he saw Peter Kane put the bag in position over the head of the accused; that he saw him drawing the bag over the accused’s head. It is, however, his case that he did not himself, place the tape in position, that he did not see Peter Kane place the tape in position; that he did not see anybody else place the tape in position; and, that he was not aware at anytime while he was inside the unit that the tape had been placed in position. 
         
        
        
         
         If you are satisfied by the Crown and - I will put that another way. If the Crown has proved to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that the act which brought about the suffocation was, in truth, the placing of the bag over the head of the man as he lay on the floor, and without more, then you would be entitled to find that that act was the act of the accused; and you would be entitled to find that upon the basis of the directions I gave you as to the position of a person who does not himself do the act, but is present while it is done, and whether expressly or by implication assents to what is being done. 
         
        
        
         
         If you were to come to the view that the act that caused the suffocation was the combined effect of the placing of the bag over the dead man’s head and its taping in position; in other words, if you were to come to the view that the taping of the bag into place was an essential part of the act which caused the suffocation, then it would be a question for you whether that might fairly be sheeted home to this accused. The answer to that question would depend upon your finding of fact as to the accused’s knowledge that the tape had been placed in position. 
         
        
        
         
         If, having considered all the relevant facts and circumstances carefully in the way that I tried to explain to you yesterday, you were to come to the conclusion that it was not a reasonable possibility that the accused had seen the tape in position before he left the flat, then you would not be entitled to hold him liable for the fact that the tape had been placed there. 
         
        
        
         
         If, on the other hand, you have been satisfied by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt that the accused, although he did not himself put the tape in place and although he did not see it being put in place, did see, before he left the unit, that it was, in fact, in place, and by his then conduct, expressly or by reasonable implication, assented to its being left in place, then you would be entitled, in accordance with the directions of law that I previously have given you, to hold him responsible for that act.” 
         
        
        
         
         (Emphasis added.) 
         
        
       
      
     51     
     In this passage, the previous directions concerning the way causation was to be dealt with were not withdrawn. They were affirmed. The jury was to find  
     the 
      cause of death.  
      
       
      
     52     
     The following further observations are to be made about this passage. First, two possible causes of death were mentioned, putting the bag over the deceased’s head and the combination of putting the bag over the head and taping it. This was not, however, an explicit or implicit withdrawal of the direction that the options included the blow to the head and the trussing up of the deceased. Indeed, there was a statement at the commencement of the passage, which we have emphasised, expressly preserving what had been said on the previous day. That included, as we have pointed out, the availability of the appellant’s own act or acts for selection as  
     the 
      cause of the death. 
      
       
      
     53     
     Secondly, there was no direction in this passage - as there was none before - concerning any legal principle which the jury was to apply in making the selection other than that they were to find which of the acts available for consideration was  
     the 
      case of death. 
      
       
        
       Discussion 
        
       
      
     54     
     The crown prosecutor had addressed the jury on the basis that the only live issues were self defence and provocation. In contrast, counsel for the appellant, in his address, disputed that the appellant had done any act causing death or was legally responsible for any act causing death. The crown prosecutor had not anticipated this approach. Accordingly, he had not, in his address, specified the way the crown put its case, absent self defence or provocation.  
      
       
      
     55     
     This put the trial judge in a very difficult position. With the benefit of hindsight, it would have been helpful for the trial judge to have ascertained from the crown prosecutor how the crown’s case should now be put to the jury, absent self defence or provocation. The crown prosecutor would then have specified the act or acts relied upon as causing death and the legal framework within which this was asserted to be a case of murder or manslaughter. There might have been dispute as to whether it was open to the jury to find that some act or acts sought to be relied upon caused death, or as to whether some legal framework sought to be relied upon was available as a matter of law. Any such dispute would have been resolved by the trial judge. In that way, the crown case to go to the jury, in fact and law, absent self defence and provocation, would have been settled before the summing up began.  
      
       
      
     56     
     A judge, confronted with a radical change in the way a defence case is being conducted, does not have the luxury of hindsight in setting a course for the balance of the trial. What seems now to have been the preferable course was not the course his Honour took. The crown prosecutor had not identified the act or acts relied on as an act or acts of the appellant or for which the appellant was legally responsible, and as being an act or acts causing the death. The crown prosecutor had not done so because he had been led to believe there was no need to do so. It was in these circumstances and, it would seem, largely as a result of these unfortunate developments, that the trial judge instructed the jury to decide what act or combination of acts constituted  
     the 
      cause of death.  
      
       
      
     57     
     Four such acts were proposed by the trial judge for their consideration, namely, the blow to the head, the trussing up, putting the bag over the head, and the taping of the bag. Of these, the first and second were the appellant’s acts. The third and fourth were Kane’s acts. If any act or acts by Kane constituted the cause of death, the jury was to decide if that act or acts should be attributed to the appellant by applying legal principles relating to principal in the second degree, as specified by the trial judge. If the cause of death was an act or acts of the appellant himself or an act or acts of Kane for which the appellant was legally responsible, the case was one of murder or manslaughter (apart from any question of self defence or provocation) depending upon whether there was the requisite specific intent for murder or, failing that, whether the act or acts causing death were unlawful and dangerous.  
      
       
      
     58     
     The legal test for causation in a criminal trial (both necessary and sufficient) was reviewed by the High Court in  
     Royall v R 
     . 
      [1991] 172 CLR 378. 
      Deane and Dawson JJ (at 411) said “a substantial or significant cause”. Toohey and Gaudron JJ (at 423) said “substantial”, and McHugh J (at 441) said “sufficiently significant”. There would be no material difference in the way a jury would understand the words “substantial” and “significant” in this context. The formula proposed by Deane and Dawson JJ, a “substantial or significant cause”, would reflect the view of the court as a whole.  
      
       
      
     59     
     There were, it seems to us, three errors in the way the case was left to the jury. First, the legal test for causation was not conveyed to the jury. 
      
       
      
     60     
     Secondly, it was an error to instruct the jury to determine  
     the 
      cause of death by making a selection from various acts left to them by the trial judge for this purpose. “[I]t is a misapplication of principle to attempt to search for a principal cause of death”:  
     R v 
       
     Mofatt 
     . 
      [2000] NSWCCA 174, per Wood CJ at CL at [66]. 
      A fortiori,  
     the 
       
     cause of death.  
      
       
      
     61     
     Thirdly, it was not, in our view, reasonably open to the jury to find that the blow to the head or the trussing up of the deceased, alone or in combination, caused the deceased’s death on the correct legal test. Neither of these acts should have been left to the jury as having been  
     a 
      cause of death, whether alone or in combination, let alone as  
     the 
      cause of death.b  
      
       
      
     62     
     It was submitted by the crown in the appeal that the approach directed by the trial judge was more favourable to the appellant than the legal test would have been. We disagree, particularly with the added complication that the blow to the head and the trussing up were incorrectly left to the jury. A jury, instructed according to  
     Royall  
     and with only the placing of the bag over the head and the taping of the bag available as a substantial or significant cause of death, might not have been satisfied that the placing of the bag over the head was both an act for which the appellant was legally responsible and a substantial or significant cause of death. There could not have been much doubt that the taping of the bag was a substantial or significant cause of death, but the jury might have found that this was not an act for which the appellant was legally responsible. The jury would then have been obliged to acquit the appellant of both murder and manslaughter.  
      
       
      
     63     
     By contrast, being instructed, as they were, to find  
     the 
      cause of death without further guidance as to the criteria, and being told that any of the four causes mentioned was available for selection, the jury might have found that putting the bag over the deceased’s head was  
     the 
      cause of death, not because it was a substantial and significant cause of death but because, without that, there would not have been a bag on the head to tape. Or, they might have found that the blow to the head and the trussing up by the appellant was  
     the 
      cause of death because those acts initiated the attack which resulted in the deceased’s death and made it possible to get the bag over the deceased’s head, from which he suffocated. In other words, being instructed to find  
     the 
      cause of death and being uninstructed as to the test to be applied, the jury might - in this case - have selected the earliest offensive act or acts without which, in their view, the deceased would not have died. Or the jury might have approached the task of finding  
     the 
      cause in some other undisclosed way that was less favourable to the appellant than the correct approach. One cannot know what criteria the jury applied in making the selection they were directed to make without being given criteria to apply.  
      
       
      
     64     
     The appellant was convicted of manslaughter. Whether the basis of that verdict was provocation or manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act, the same point in relation to causation of death applies. There is a serious possibility that the appellant was convicted on an incorrect test of causation and that he would not have been convicted on the correct test.  
      
       
      
     65     
     It was submitted by the crown on appeal that the asserted error in the summing up in relation to causation was not subject to objection at the trial. On our reading of the record, that is so. However, the errors were fundamental, in the sense which makes it appropriate to grant leave under Rule 4 to argue grounds 1 and 2. 
      
       
      
     66     
     The appeal should be allowed under grounds 1 and 2. It is unnecessary to decide the other grounds of appeal. A new trial should be ordered.  
      
       
        
       Orders 
       
      
     67     
     The orders of the court are: 
      
       
        
       (1) Appeal allowed. 
        
        
         
         (2) Order a new trial.

     R v Walter GOVER 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1    STEIN JA: I agree with Dunford J. 
    2    DUNFORD J: This is an appeal by Walter Gover against his conviction for a number of offences following his trial before her Honour Judge Backhouse QC and a jury in the District Court at Sydney. 
    3    The Crown case was that in April - May 1995 the appellant came into possession of an American Express card in the name of Adrian Chenhall and subsequently used that card to purchase an oil drip tray from K-Mart at Bondi Junction on 25 May 1995, and that on 8 June by representing himself to be Adrian Chenhall, the holder of the card, he purchased a Jeep Cherokee motor vehicle from Sanderson Motors for a price of $52,000 but, as he was unable to produce a passport or other identification in a name corresponding with that on the card, at the suggestion of the car salesman, he purchased a shelf company so that the vehicle could be registered in the company name, and for the purchase of the company he again used Mr Chenhall's American Express card. 
    4    After Mr Chenhall had complained to American Express about debits appearing on his statement, enquiries were made, the car salesman identified the appellant from a group of photographs shown to him, and on 23 June the vehicle was located by police being driven into the driveway of the appellant's premises in Blackheath. 
    5    Later that evening, after obtaining a statement from Mr Chenhall, the police obtained a search warrant and returned to the appellant's premises. They told him that they believed that the Jeep had been obtained through the fraudulent use of a credit card and asked how he came to be in possession of the vehicle, to which the appellant replied that Mr Chenhall had given it to him to drive two days previously. A search of his premises located two mobile telephones whose numbers corresponded with those used or referred to in conversations involved in acquiring the vehicle, the certificate of registration and third party insurance certificate for the vehicle as well as the keys of the vehicle, and in the basement they found an oil drip tray and a receipt showing that the tray had been purchased on 25 May using the relevant American Express Card. 
    6    As a result of these events the appellant was indicted on the following charges: 
     
     1. That between 1 April 1995 and 7 May 1995 at Sydney, he did steal one American Express Gold Card No. 3760 300440 72000, the property of Adrian Chenhall. 
      
      
     2. That on 25 May 1995 at Bondi Junction, by a deception, namely by purporting to be Adrian Chenhall and presenting American Express Gold Card No. 3760 300440 72000 in the name of Adrian Chenhall, he dishonestly obtained for himself a valuable thing, namely, an oil drip pan. 
      
      
     3. That between 3 June 1995 and 9 June 1995 at Rose Bay, by a deception, namely by purporting to be Adrian Chenhall, the holder of American Express Gold Card No. 3760 300440 72000, he dishonestly obtained for himself a valuable thing, namely, a 1995 Jeep Cherokee motor vehicle. 
      
      
     4. That on 8 June 1995 at Wentworth Falls, he made a false instrument, namely, a document showing both sides of a stolen American Express Gold Card No. 3760 300440 72000 in the name of Adrian Chenhall, with intent that he use the false instrument to induce Sandersons Eastern Suburbs Pty. Limited, trading as Sandersons Motors, to accept the said false instrument as genuine and thereby sell a 1995 Jeep Cherokee motor vehicle to the prejudice of Adrian Chenhall. 
      
      
     5. That on 8 June 1995 at Wentworth Falls, he used a copy of a false instrument, namely, a document showing both sides of a stolen American Express Gold Card No. 3760 300440 72000 in the name of Adrian Chenhall, with intent that he use the false instrument to induce Sandersons Eastern Suburbs Pty. Limited, trading as Sandersons Motors, to accept the said false instrument as genuine and thereby sell a 1995 Jeep Cherokee Motor vehicle to the prejudice of Adrian Chenhall. 
      
      
     6. That on 8 June 1995 at Wentworth Falls, he used a copy of a false instrument, namely, a document purporting to be an authorisation under the name of Adrian Nicholas Chenhall, Company Director, ACN 069 731 540 Pty Limited with intent that he use the false instrument to induce Sandersons Eastern Suburbs Pty Limited, trading as Sandersons Motors, to accept the said false instrument as genuine and thereby sell a 1995 Jeep Cherokee motor vehicle to the prejudice of Adrian Chenhall. 
      
      
    7    Following his trial the jury found him not guilty on count 1 and guilty on counts 2 to 6. He was subsequently sentenced as follows: 
     
     Counts 2 & 3:  
     Fixed Term: 
      6 months imprisonment to commence 10 September 1999 and to expire 9 March 2000. 
      
     Counts 4-6:  
     Minimum Term: 
      9 months imprisonment to commence 10 September 1999 and to expire 9 June 2000. 
      
       
     Additional Term: 
      9 months to commence 10 June 2000 and to expire 9 March 2001. 
      
    8    The appellant's defence in substance was that he assisted with the purchase and taking delivery of the vehicle at the request of Mr Chenhall, who wanted to pay for the vehicle with his American Express card so as to earn Frequent Flyer points, and because he had lost his drivers licence; and the vehicle was generally kept at Mr Chenhall's place, but on 23 June after they had both been drinking at a local hotel, Mr Chenhall gave him the keys and he drove himself home in the Jeep, which is how he came to have it when the police called that evening. 
     
      
     Ground 1: Her Honour the learned trial Judge erred in admitting into evidence the written statements of the deceased Adrian Chenhall. 
      
    9    During the investigation the owner of the relevant card Adrian Chenell made two statements to police dated respectively 23 June and 12 August 1995, in which inter alia he denied himself purchasing the vehicle with the card and denied giving any person permission to use such card. His second statement also identified and annexed a number of relevant documents and denied that the signatures on them were his. Mr Chenhall died in 1997 and at the trial his two statements were admitted into evidence pursuant to s 409(7) Crimes Act 1900, since repealed and re-enacted as s 116 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
    10    The committal proceedings took the form of a ""paper committal"" pursuant to Part 4 Subdivision 7A, of the Justices Act 1902 (ss 48-48I) as it stood at the time of the appellant's arrest (24 June 1995) and the committal proceedings (16 February 1996). 
    11    Section 48AA(1) provided that (subject to other provisions of the section, none of which are presently relevant) evidence for the prosecution in any committal proceedings was to be given by means of written statements which were admissible as evidence under s 48A. 
     
     Section 48A(1) was as follows:  
      
       
       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, but subject to this Subdivision, a written statement by any person is, if tendered by the informant, admissible in committal proceedings as evidence to the same extent as if it were oral evidence to the like effect given in those proceedings by that person. 
       
      
      
     Section 48B provided for service on the defendant of the statements and proposed exhibits and s 48C required the statement to contain endorsements attesting to its truth and the knowledge of the maker of the statement that he or she would be liable to prosecution if wilfully stating in it anything known to be false or not believed to be true while, s 48D required service of a notice explaining the effect of the subdivision and the rights of the defendant in relation thereto. 
      
      
     Section 48E(1) was as follows: 
      
       
       Where in any committal proceedings: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) the defendant has been served with a copy of a written statement, as referred to in section 48B, and serves on the informant, within such period as the Justice or Justices may direct, a notice to the effect that the defendant desires the attendance at those proceedings of the person who made the statement; or 
        
       (b) the Justice or Justices (if satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do so), on his, her or their own motion, or on the application of the defendant, gives or give a direction requiring the attendance at those proceedings of the person who made a written statement tendered as evidence under this Subdivision, 
        
       the statement, if not already admitted as evidence in those proceedings, is not admissible as evidence under section 48A in those proceedings if: 
       
      
      
       
       (c) in a case to which paragraph (a) applies - the defendant, after serving the notice referred to in that paragraph, does not consent to the admission in evidence of the statement; or 
        
        
       (d) in the case to which paragraph (b) applies - the Justice or Justices, after giving the direction referred to in that paragraph, does not or do not withdraw the direction. 
       
      
      
     Section 409(7)  
     Crimes Act 1900 
      was as follows: 
      
       
       Except in so far as the Judge otherwise orders, a prescribed statement may be read as evidence for the prosecution at the trial of the accused upon proof on oath that the person who made the statement is dead, or so ill as not to be able to travel or to give evidence, or so ill as not to be able to travel or to give evidence without a risk of endangering the life of the person, or is absent from Australia. 
       
      
      
     and subsection (11) provided: 
      
       
       In this section,  
       ""prescribed statement""  
       means: 
        
       (a) a written statement the whole or a part of which was admitted as evidence under section 48A of the Justices Act 1902 and includes a part of any such statement rejected under section 48F of that Act; or 
        
       (b) a written statement the whole or a part of which was tendered as evidence on a plea of guilty under section 51A of the Justices Act 1902. 
        
        
       
      
    12    Following the arrest of the appellant on 24 June 1995, the various statements and other documents to be relied on by the prosecution at the committal, together with the statement required by s 48D, were served on the appellant's then solicitors and subsequently notice was given pursuant to s 48E(1)(a) that all witnesses were required to attend for the purpose of giving evidence. The committal proceedings were adjourned and ultimately came on for hearing on 16 February 1996 when there was no attendance by the defendant nor by any barrister or solicitor on his behalf. The magistrate heard evidence on oath from Sergeant Gaspert to the effect that the appellant although aware of the adjournment had not appeared; of service of the statements of witnesses upon his solicitors; that it had been notified to him that all witnesses were required to attend court for the purposes of giving evidence; and that he had taken steps to have those witnesses attend in court on that day. The magistrate being satisfied of these matters, he admitted the statements, including those of Mr Chenhall, into evidence and having read them formally committed the appellant for trial. 
    13    The matter first came before her Honour, the learned trial judge, on 2 August 1999 by which time Mr Chenhall had died on 28 December 1997, as a result of myo- cardial infarction and alcoholic cirrhosis, and it was indicated to her Honour that there was a preliminary issue to be determined, namely the admissibility of Mr Chenhall's two statements, the appellant's counsel submitting, as was the case before this Court, that the statements were not admissible because, notice having been given for the witnesses to attend for cross-examination and the appellant not having consented to them not being present, the statements of the deceased were not admissible in the committal proceedings, and therefore were not admissible at the trial pursuant to s 409(7) of the Crimes Act.  
    14    Although no evidence was led on this occasion, the matter being confined to legal argument on assumed facts, the proceedings on 2 August are conveniently referred to as ""the first voir dire"". The argument appears to have centred entirely around s 409(7) and a reference to s 65 of the Evidence Act 1995, was a remark in passing by her Honour. At the end of the argument, her Honour reserved her decision overnight, and the following day ruled that both statements were admissible but gave no reasons.  
    15    The trial was further adjourned and came on again on 5 October 1999 when the appellant was arraigned and pleaded not guilty. In the absence of the jury an application was made by counsel then appearing for the appellant for the two statements of Mr Chenhall to be excluded on discretionary grounds pursuant to the discretion said to be contained in s 409 itself, or alternatively pursuant to s 137 Evidence Act 1995. The basis of the application as stated by counsel was that the maker of the statements was a person who was not particularly reliable as he had a significant alcohol problem, was prone to psychotic episodes and to making false accusations against other persons. The Court thereupon embarked on a further voir dire (""the second voir dire"") during which evidence was called on behalf of both the appellant and the Crown.  
    16    Her Honour gave judgment on that application the following day, 6 October 1999, with detailed reasons. In those reasons she reviewed the evidence of the witnesses that had been called. She noted that one of the witnesses called on behalf of the Crown, a Ms Reed, had not seen the appellant since 1990, that Dr Penny was unable to assist as to the deceased's mental condition and capacity to make the statements in June and August 1995, and that Ms Egan, with whom the deceased lived, although giving evidence of his drinking habits and other health problems, had a number of problems of her own and was unable to shed any light or any particular observation as to the deceased's ability or his capacity to make the statements. On the other hand, the police officer, the former Sergeant Gaspert, who had taken the statements, noticed nothing suggesting incapacity on the deceased's part to recall or make the statements. There was also evidence that the deceased had looked after his own financial affairs. In these circumstances her Honour was not satisfied that the prejudicial effect outweighed the probative value of the evidence contained in the two statements, although she noted that it would be necessary for there to be an appropriate direction, presumably to the effect that the deceased was not available for cross-examination before the jury.  
    17    The trial then proceeded. Mr Gaspert who had been in charge of the investigation at the time was cross-examined about taking the statements and agreed that when he visited the deceased's house to take the second statement, the interior was somewhat dilapidated and ramshackled, but he noticed nothing unusual about the deceased's manner of speech and found him quite easy to communicate with, and in particular that he did not have very slurred speech or anything of that nature.  
    18    Detective Sergeant Bayley, who by the trial had become the officer in charge of the matter, gave evidence that he had become aware of the death of the deceased, and the death certificate and the two statements with the annexures to the second one were tendered and admitted without objection. I regard the fact that they were admitted without objection at that stage to mean that no objection was taken to the formalities of the tender, but that the earlier objection to the admissibility was not withdrawn. After being tendered as exhibits, the statements were read to the jury, but as exhibits they subsequently went to the jury room whilst the jury considered its deliberations.  
    19    The first objection to admissibility under s 409 was the submission that that section was impliedly repealed by the provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 particularly s 65 dealing with the admissibility of representations by persons who are not available to be called as witnesses, and we were referred to a number of cases, including Goodwin v Phillips (1908) 7 CLR 1, Mitchell v Scale (1907) 5 CLR 405, and R v Chalak (1983) 47 ALR 600 at 602, Rose v Hvric (1963) 108 CLR 353 at 360 and Jennings Industries Limited v The Commonwealth (1984) 57 ACTR5 at 21, and to Pearce on Statutory Interpretation 4th ed. at p 198.  
    20    The two provisions deal with different subject matters even though there may be some overlapping, s 409 deals with admissibility of depositions and statements by witnesses at committal who have died by the time of trial, and s 65 deals with exceptions to the hearsay rule, and renders prior representations admissible in criminal proceedings where the maker of the representation is not available to give evidence. But in none of the cases referred to above did the later Act contain an express provision such as s 8 of the Evidence Act which expressly provides that that Act does not affect the operation of the provisions of any other Act.  
    21    There is no room for implied repeal where there is an express provision such as s 8 to the effect that there shall not be any such implied repeal. The effect of that section is that the Evidence Act is not intended to, and does not affect other mechanisms which are provided in state or federal legislation for the admission of evidence: cf Commissioner of Taxation v Karageorge (1996) 22 ACSR 119. In any event, the Parliament regarded s 409 as still applicable because it was repealed and re-enacted as ss 112 to 116, Criminal Procedure Act 1986, by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 1999, see Act No. 94 of 1999. 
    22    Alternatively, if the appellant's argument was correct in this regard it might raise questions of whether s 65 was impliedly repealed by ss 112-116 Criminal Procedure Act, an argument which would obviously be untenable because s 65 covers a much wider field than the other provision. But even prior to Act No. 94 of 1999 the Evidence (Consequential and Other Provisions) Act 1995 which was enacted contemporaneously with, and was complementary to, the Evidence Act effected substantial amendments to the Crimes Act including the repeal of ss 408 and 410, but there was no amendment to or repeal of s 409, which was a long standing provision. I am therefore satisfied that s 409 was not impliedly repealed by any section of the Evidence Act, and was in force at the time of the appellant's trial.  
    23    The next submission was that the only statements of a deceased person admissible under s 409 were statements that were properly admissible at the committal and that, as notice had been given for the attendance of all the witnesses pursuant to s 48E(1) and the appellant did not consent to the admission of evidence of any of the statements, those statements, including the statement of Mr Chenhall, were not admissible as evidence under s 48A, and R v Adamiczka (1993) 33 NSWLR 68 and R v Stackelroth (1996) 86 A Crim R 438 were referred to.  
    24    Adamiczka was a case where s 48D(2), which requires the magistrate to address the defendant who is unrepresented in a prescribed form of words which includes the opportunity to ask for an adjournment, had not been complied with; and it was held that in the light of such non-compliance the relevant statement was not ""properly admitted"" pursuant to s 48A, and therefore was not a ""prescribed statement"" within the terms of s 409.  
    25    That, however, is a somewhat different case to the present where, although admitted to bail which required his attendance at the Local Court for the committal hearing, the appellant did not appear on 16 February 1996, and before proceeding with the committal hearing the proceedings were adjourned so that a warrant could be issued pursuant to s 41(1B)(d), after which the evidence for the prosecution could be taken in the absence of the appellant. It has been held in a number of cases that most criminal proceedings can proceed in the absence of a party who voluntarily absents himself, see for example R v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67 at 71-73, (the case of a respondent to a Crown appeal against sentence, where the authorities are collected), and in a number of cases this has been referred to as ""waiver"": e.g. R v Abrahams (1895) 21 VLR 343 at 347-348, R v Jones No. 2 [1972] 1 WLR 887 at 891-2, 56 Cr App R 413 at 419-421. I see no reason why similar considerations should not apply to committal proceedings, so that where a defendant has voluntarily absented himself, particularly in breach of his bail undertaking (as here), he should be deemed to have waived his right to be present.  
    26    In R v Sullivan (CCA - 22 August 1995) it was held that the conditions prescribed by s 48C for admissibility of a statement could be ""waived"" by a defendant, so that notwithstanding the failure of the statement to comply with that section, having been admitted at the committal, the statement became admissible at the trial under s 407(7) following the death of the maker of the statement. In that case the defendant was represented at the committal. 
    27    The object of giving notice pursuant to s 48E(1)(a) is so that the witness can be present at the committal for the purposes of being cross-examined on his statement, as there could be no other purpose in the witnesses being required to attend. The giving of the notice for the witnesses to attend indicates that the appellant wished to cross-examine them, but the failure on his part to appear at the committal indicates that he no longer wished to do so. In my opinion, where a defendant has given notice, and subsequently by non-attendance has waived his right to be present, he should be deemed to have impliedly consented to the statement being tendered in his absence. Accordingly, I would regard the statements tendered in the present case as being ""properly admitted"", notwithstanding that notice had been given for the makers to attend at the committal, and there had been no express formal consent to the statements being tendered in the absence of the witnesses.  
    28    Stackelroth was concerned primarily with whether, if the conditions for admissibility under s 409(7) had been satisfied, there was a residual discretion to exclude a witness' statement apart from the general discretion to exclude unfairly prejudicial evidence; see now Evidence Act ss 135, 137. There was also an issue whether the statement in question had in fact been amongst the material tendered at the committal. The maker of the statement had in fact been cross-examined at length at the committal and no question of the defendant's failure to appear or to cross-examine was in issue. 
    29    The other matter raised in relation to s 409 was that the statements were tendered and went into evidence as exhibits instead of, as s 409 requires, being read to the jury. This is a technical objection which could have been but was not taken at the time they were tendered. This point was not covered by her Honour's rulings on either of the two voir dires, but when the statements were tendered near the end of the Crown case there was no objection, and I regard that as indicating no objection to them becoming exhibits, as opposed to being read to the jury. Although technically they should have been read to the jury rather than tendered as exhibits, it makes little difference in this day and age when the jury is often supplied with parts of the transcript and permitted to read the evidence of the witnesses. The objection not having been taken at the trial, Rule 4 applies, and as it is of a purely technical nature I would refuse leave to argue it.  
    30    For these reasons I am satisfied that the two statements of Mr Chenhall were admissible pursuant to s 409 of the Crimes Act as it then stood,  
    31    Even if the statements were not admissible under s 409(7) they were in my opinion admissible pursuant to s 65 of the Evidence Act 1995 which provides: 
     
      
       
       (1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact. 
        
       (2) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation was: 
        
        (a) made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind; or 
         
        (b) made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication; or 
         
        (c) made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable; or 
         
        (d) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made . . . 
        
        
       
      
    32    That section applies in proceedings where the maker of a previous representation is unavailable to give evidence of an asserted fact (subs (1)). The witness is unavailable if dead: Dictionary, cl 4(1)(a). The representation may be oral or in writing and ""previous representation"" is one made other than in accordance with giving evidence in the same proceedings: Dictionary.  
    33    It was submitted that the statements did not come within paragraphs (b) or (c) of s 65(2). In my view they came within both. At the time of the first statement (23 June 1995) the Jeep had not been recovered, the statement essentially related to Mr Chenhall's receipt in mid June of his American Express statement and the steps he had taken following such receipt, and a denial that he had sought authorisation for a $50,000 purchase on 3 June. The statement should be regarded as made ""shortly after the asserted fact(s) occurred"" and I can see nothing in the circumstances to suggest these representations may be fabrications. On the other hand, the assertions in paragraphs 7 and 9 relate to events more remote in time and may not satisfy the test of being made ""shortly after"" the asserted facts occurred. As the later statement of 12 August 1995 relates to documents shown to him on that same day the representations contained therein were clearly made ""when or shortly after the asserted fact(s) occurred"" and once again there is nothing in the circumstances to suggest the representations may be fabrications - particularly as in relation to the second document the alleged forged signature purporting to be his is misspelt. Most of the first statement and the whole of the later statement therefore come within s 65(2)(b). 
    34    Section 65(2)(c) requires that the representations be made in circumstances that make it highly probable that they are reliable. The whole basis for the second voir dire was to exclude the evidence on the basis that the deceased, because of his alcoholism and other conditions, may not have been a credible witness, but her Honour rejected these submissions, and in my view, although not expressly referring to s 65, in light of her Honour's findings, no other conclusion could have been reached but that the conditions of s 65(2)(c) were satisfied.  
    35    True it is that notice under s 67 had not been given, but if her Honour had ruled at the conclusion of the first voir dire that the statements were not admissible under s 409, notice could, and presumably would, have been given pursuant to s 67 at that stage. Section 67(4) gives the Court power to admit the representations notwithstanding the failure to give notice, and in my view, if the statements had been rejected under s 409, and an application had been made to dispense with notice under 67, this was an appropriate case for such leave to be given. The appellant and his legal advisors had defacto notice at all relevant times that the Crown intended to lead these statements in evidence. 
    36    For these reasons, even if the statements were not admissible under s 409(7) Crimes Act, I am satisfied they were admissible under s 65(2), Evidence Act 1995. 
     
      
     Ground 2: Her Honour erred in failing to discharge the Jury consequent upon the Jury asking, ""Why is the defendant now under correctional services guard?"" 
      
     In the alternative 
      
     Failing to take corrective steps by way of appropriate warning or direction in relation to Ground 2. 
      
    37    The appellant had been on bail during the trial but failed to a appear on 12 October 1999, the sixth day of the trial, in circumstances detailed in the transcript and his bail was revoked. Two days later on, 14 October 1999, the jury asked the question referred to. Discussion followed and appellant's then counsel specifically did not seek the discharge of the jury and said: 
     
      
       
       ""I think that all that can be really said in the circumstances is that it's a matter of no relevance and certainly something they ought not to speculate on."" 
       
      
      
     After further discussion on other unrelated legal issues, the jury returned to court and were directed as follows:  
      
       
       ""Firstly in relation to the number 1 question in relation to Mr Gover, I direct you that you should not be concerned about that situation. It is irrelevant and you, the members of the jury should not speculate so it's not something that should impinge upon your deliberations at all."" 
       
      
    38    It was submitted that the appearance in court of the appellant apparently in Corrective Services custody was tantamount to evidence of bad character, which was inadmissible, could not be remedied, and required discharge of the jury; or at least a direction in different terms. 
    39    The ground is completely without merit. Rule 4 applies, one cannot assume that the jury or any member of it would infer guilt as a result of seeing the appellant in custody, it was a situation of the appellant's own making in failing to honour his bail undertaking to appear, his counsel expressly declined to seek the discharge of the jury, and the direction given was in substance and effect that requested by his counsel. 
     
      
     Ground 3: Her Honour erred in her response to the jury to the following question: ""We need clarification on the following point. Is 'another reasonable explanation' limited to the evidence before us?"" 
      
    40    This was a question sent to the trial judge after the jury had been deliberating for some time, and related to her Honour's directions regarding circumstantial evidence. After the question was received there was considerable discussion in the absence of the jury as to how the question should be answered and in the light of that discussion her Honour redirected the jury on circumstantial evidence and then said:  
     
      
       
       ""So it is for the Crown to satisfy you of the guilt of the accused. If in fact, you were of the view that, based on the evidence, there was a reasonable explanation consistent with innocence, then it is for the Crown to negate that explanation.""  
       
      
      
     She then repeated the direction she had previously given on the drawing of inferences.  
      
    41    It is the passage quoted above that is objected to and it was submitted that that passage was inconsistent with the recent decision of this Court in R v McIntyre [2000] NSWCCA 6. That was an arson case where it had been argued at the trial that the evidence was consistent with the fire being either deliberately or accidentally lit by the owner of the premises, the estranged former partner of the appellant. The trial judge had directed the jury: 
     
      
       
       ""There was no evidence that the fire was either accidentally or deliberately lit by Ms West. Those matters were no more than suggestions. You are not allowed to speculate or guess. You can draw inferences but only from the evidence.""  
       
      
      
     In upholding the appeal, Hulme J, with whom Sully and Hidden JJ agreed, said: 
      
       
       ""It is of course both proper and common for a judge in the course of a summing up to tell a jury that they must not speculate or guess, operations of the mind quite different from the drawing of inferences. However, as his Honour pointed out to the jury, this was a circumstantial case. The appellant was entitled to be acquitted if the Crown could not exclude all reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence.  
       
      
      
       
       Such hypotheses must, as I have said, be reasonable. But a jury does not have to be able to infer that an event, the subject of such an hypothesis, in fact occurred before relying on, or making allowance for, the possibility of such an event."" 
       
      
      
       
      
    42    The other reasonable hypothesis or the explanation does not need to be something of which there is evidence, as was suggested by the direction given to the jury in McIntyre, but it must be consistent with such evidence as the jury accepts. A jury must consider whether the evidence is consistent with any hypothesis or explanation consistent with innocence, but cannot have regard to hypotheses or explanations which are inconsistent with such evidence as they accept. In my view this is all that her Honour was conveying to the jury, namely that they were to look to the evidence to see whether there was any other reasonable explanation consistent with innocence, but not guess or speculate on matters inconsistent with the evidence in the case. She was not suggesting, as was the case in McIntyre, that there had to be some direct evidence of the alternative hypothesis or explanation. That case is therefore distinguishable and, having regard to the whole of the answer to the question and bearing in mind what preceded and what followed the passage complained of, I do not consider the jury could have possibly been misled into looking for direct evidence of an alternative hypothesis or explanation.  
    43    No objection was taken to the direction when it was given, which I say followed a lengthy discussion in the absence of the jury so Rule 4 applies; but in this regard it is only fair to record that counsel who had been appearing for the appellant during the trial was not able to appear on the day the question was asked and answered, and the solicitor who took his place acknowledged that he was not as familiar with the case as counsel had been.  
    44    I would give leave to argue the point although no objection was taken at the time, but I am satisfied that the ground is without substance and there was no error of law in her Honour's direction. 
    45    For these reasons I consider that the appeal should be dismissed and the convictions affirmed. 
    46    SIMPSON J: I agree with the orders proposed by Dunford J and with his Honour's reasons.

     R v Tony SANDNESS 
      
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: The prisoner Tony Sandness pleaded not guilty to the murder of Donald Foster but on the second day of the trial he changed that plea to one of guilty of manslaughter, which the Crown accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment. 
    2    On 30 December 1997 at about 3 pm the deceased then 80 years old, weak and with a number of health problems, was in bed at his home at 16 Vera St, Earlwood when he was bludgeoned with a half brick resulting in severe head injuries from which he bled profusely. He was taken to hospital but died there on 9 January 1998, some 10 days later, as a result of his injuries. 
    3    The prisoner gave evidence on the sentencing proceedings and said that he had been addicted to heroin and amphetamines for some years and whilst a patient at Wisteria House, a drug rehabilitation unit, he had formed a relationship with Sue-Ann Foster, the grand-daughter of the deceased and another addict. He said that on 30 December the two of them went to the deceased's home to get money, believing that at that time of the day he would not be at home. He said they wanted $40 to buy a ball joint for Ms Foster's car, but I am satisfied to the criminal standard that they also wanted money to purchase drugs. Ms Foster had been to the grandfather's place before asking for money when he was there and he had refused her, so on this occasion they decided to go when he was not there and steal it.  
    4    The prisoner said that after parking their car (which was a stolen car) in a parking area nearby at the end of the street, they entered the premises by him bending a padlock lever on a side gate and Ms Foster then using her keys to gain entry through the back door, although other evidence indicated that the door must have been unlocked at the time. He said Ms Foster went in whilst he remained at the back door, he heard mumbled talk and a scuffle and then Ms Foster called him, so we went into the premises and found the deceased in his bedroom holding Ms Foster who was struggling. The prisoner hit the deceased in the mouth with his closed fist causing him to let go of her and grab him by the shirt.  
    5    A struggle ensued while Ms Foster was going through the deceased's cupboards. At one stage the prisoner discovered a half brick on the floor, he picked it up and struck the deceased twice on the head with it causing him to curl up in a ball partly on the bed and partly on the floor. They then both left, Ms Foster taking $1,500 in cash from the premises, and ran down the street to their car, the prisoner changed his clothes and they drove away. Of the $1,500 taken, $500 was used by the prisoner to complete the purchase of a motor vehicle, and the balance was spent by Foster on the purchase of heroin for the use of both of them.  
    6    A short time later the prisoner, at the urging of Foster, rang the ambulance emergency number on an anonymous basis asking them to attend the deceased's house, but unfortunately the wrong house number was given and the ambulance initially went to the wrong address. Shortly afterwards a neighbour entered the deceased's house, he found the rear gate latch badly twisted and the back door closed but unlocked. He then entered the bedroom and found the deceased lying on the floor near the curtains under the window with blood all over his face and over the bottom of the curtains. A pair of thongs was located in the hallway near the linen cupboard and bathroom. In addition the bedroom showed signs of quite a struggle. On admission to hospital the deceased was suffering extreme facial contusions, three fractures to the skull (right parietal, zygoma and maxilla) and a subdural haematoma with brain compression.  
    7    The prisoner and Foster were both arrested on 1 January and charged with malicious wounding and both were interviewed. Foster said that their purpose in going to the deceased's house had been trying to get him to know her son (his great grandson) but when they got there she changed her mind about seeing her grandfather and did not go into the house, and that only the prisoner went in which he did twice, the latter time coming out and saying he thought he had killed the grandfather and to run, and he later told her he had hit the deceased on the head with a brick and that the amount taken had been $700-$800. 
    8    She agreed to give evidence against the prisoner to the effect of her interview and in due course pleaded guilty to a charge of accessory after the fact to maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm and was released on a recognisance under s 558, Crimes Act; herself in the sum of $200 to be of good behaviour for two years and accept supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. Her version was clearly untrue and was designed, very successfully, to minimise her role. 
    9    The prisoner was also interviewed on 1 January . He denied all knowledge of the deceased or his injuries and put forth an alibi which was later proved to be false. 
    10    I am satisfied that the prisoner's current version is much closer to the truth, but is not the entire truth. In light of evidence from another grand-daughter of the deceased I am satisfied that there was no half brick inside the house and the prisoner took the lethal weapon into the house from the backyard where there were a number of them, and that the reason why he removed his thongs on entering the house was to avoid being heard. 
    11    Bearing these matters in mind I am satisfied that the prisoner and Foster went to the house to get money, primarily to buy drugs, when they knew the deceased would not give it to them voluntarily. Whether they expected the deceased to be at home is not clear but in breaking the latch on the side gate, arming himself with the half brick and removing his thongs, the prisoner was not taking any chances. Presumably when confronted, the deceased refused to give them the money and so whilst the prisoner violently bashed the victim with injuries that ultimately resulted in his death, Foster looked for and found the money, which they took. 
    12    At the time the Crown accepted the plea of guilty to manslaughter, there was no direct evidence available to it of what went on inside the deceased's house (Ms Foster, who was to be the principal Crown witness, claiming that she had remained outside), and consequently it may not have been able to prove an intention on the part of the prisoner to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. The Crown therefore accepted the plea on the basis that the act of the prisoner in hitting the deceased on the head with a half brick constituted an unlawful and dangerous act, and I sentence him on that basis. I should add that two neighbours of the deceased saw the prisoner and Foster running down the street and were able to give the police descriptions of them, and one of the neighbours took down the number plates on the getaway car, and notwithstanding that the car was stolen these number plates were located by police at the boarding house where the prisoner and Foster were subsequently arrested. Identification of the prisoner as a person involved in the attack on the deceased would not have been a problem. 
    13    By any standard this was a most despicable killing of another human being, a frail, sick, 80 year old man in bed in his own house killed by an accomplice of his own grand-daughter in order to steal money to purchase illegal drugs to feed their addictions. 
    14    Not only did it involve the actual killing but also the unlawful entry to the unfortunate man's house, a place where above all else he was entitled to feel secure and at peace. These factors place it in the more serious range of manslaughter cases and denote a very high degree of criminality. On the other hand, I must take into account that the offence of manslaughter does not involve any intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. 
    15    The prisoner was born on 2 March 1968 so he is now aged 32, and was raised in Queensland. He was the sixth of eight children and comes from an apparently supportive family, all other members of which have pursued worthwhile careers. His father died in 1977 and, according to the Pre-Sentence Report (Ex. J) his mother reported that after she remarried, the prisoner had a good relationship with his stepfather. A very different picture was presented by the prisoner's sister Mrs Voliski, who said that the stepfather was an alcoholic, a compulsive gambler and very violent who ""hated every one of us and still does"". She also said that their father was also an alcoholic and violent, and he apparently died by drowning after falling from a houseboat. 
    16    The prisoner suffered from dyslexia and, although he claims an ability to read and understand, he is unable to write. Consequently he only completed part of his secondary education and his only employment has been labouring work. He also has an interest in the mechanical repair of motor vehicles, but because of his illiteracy, lacks any qualifications in that regard. 
    17    It appears he also sustained some head injury as a 2 year old in a motor vehicle accident and in 1996 he injured his left wrist when he fell from a building at work. He has not worked since. 
    18    He has been a long time user of illegal drugs and at the time of the offence was addicted to heroin and amphetamines. He was, according to what he told Dr Davies, also using Valium and Normisson. In 1997 he spent time at Cumberland Hospital, Sydney undergoing detoxification for overdoses of opiates, benzodiazepines and amphetamines, and at another stage he was treated for Valium withdrawal. Shortly before the killing of Mr Foster he was an inmate at Wisterea House for drug rehabilitation and it was there that he met the co-offender. He was on a methadone program but also using heroin at the time of the offence. He has a number of convictions in Queensland including break, enter and steal, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, possession of dangerous drug and possession of a nunchuka. This seems to be his first time in gaol since a 3 month sentence imposed in 1986 for car stealing. 
    19    He has a 12 year old daughter as a result of an earlier relationship long since finished, and he does not know the whereabouts of the child. 
    20    The prisoner has in the past made a number of unsuccessful attempts to overcome his drug addiction and he claims he has not used any unlawful drugs since being imprisoned and that he is no longer on methadone. He is also seeking assistance within the gaol system with his writing difficulties. 
    21    Dr Davies noted that he has been treated in gaol for recurrent anxiety and at one point for paranoid ideation, and has been placed in protective custody because of difficulties in coping with crowds. Doctor Davies diagnosed a condition of chronic phobic anxiety with a secondary factor of substance abuse. 
    22    Having regard to his comparatively minor criminal record and his previous attempts to overcome his addiction, I am satisfied that he has the desire to do so; and that if he can succeed in that regard and particularly if he can obtain help with his reading and writing there is no reason why he should not in time become a useful member of society; but it will require effort and a sense of responsibility on his part. 
    23    He has pleaded guilty, although not at the earliest opportunity, and expressed his remorse and shame for his actions. He was affected by drugs at the time and also called the ambulance to go to the assistance of the deceased; I have taken all these factors into account. In relation to the plea of guilty I am satisfied that notwithstanding the apparent reservations of the Crown Prosecutor, the Crown case against the accused was a strong one and conviction was inevitable, but I nevertheless give him credit on account of the remorse shown by the plea and for saving the State and the victim's family the cost and ordeal respectively of a trial and I have accordingly reduced the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by 1 year and reduced the non parole period by 6 months. Having regard to the objective criminality involved as detailed above I consider no further discount or reduction to be appropriate. I am not satisfied that any special circumstances exist within the terms of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
    24    The prisoner has been in custody for this matter since 1 January 1998 and the sentence will be backdated to that date. 
     
      
      
    25    Tony Sandness for the manslaughter of Donald Foster I sentence you to imprisonment for 11 years, such sentence to be taken to have commenced on 1 January 1998 and I set a non parole period of 8 years and 6 months. The earliest day on which you will be eligible to be realised on parole will be 30 June 2006. 
    26    Exhibits to be returned.

     2     
     SPERLING J 
     : On 17 March 1999, the applicant pleaded guilty to two charges: firstly, that on 2 August 1998 at Nowra he broke and entered a dwelling house and there committed a felony, namely stealing, being armed with an offensive weapon, namely, a 20 cm knife; secondly, kidnapping which consisted of taking away Joan Fletcher with intent to hold her for advantage. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The maximum penalty for the first offence is 20 years penal servitude and for the second offence 14 years penal servitude. 
      
       
      
     4     
     For the first offence, the applicant was sentenced to penal servitude for six years including a minimum term of four years and six months. For the second offence the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of penal servitude for one and a half years, to be served concurrently. The sentences commenced on 18 September 1998, being the date on which the applicant was taken into custody. 
      
       
      
     5     
     The applicant was born on 20 February 1975. At the time of these offences he was 22 years of age.  
      
       
      
     6     
     The applicant was drug dependant. His criminal history was characteristic. It included convictions for property offences and for possession and supply of a prohibited drug. At the time of the sentence imposed on 3 June 1999, the heaviest sentence the applicant had received was in 1997, being a community service order of 50 hours for supplying a prohibited drug.  
      
       
      
     7     
     The facts of the matter may be summarised as follows. At about 2am on Sunday 2 August 1998, the victim, Joan Lesley Fletcher, who was then 69 years of age, woke to find the applicant standing over her with a knife at her throat. He demanded money. She got out of bed and handed him her purse. The application forced the victim to follow him around the house while he removed a large amount of property from different rooms, taking household items such as a TV set and a video and stereo unit. He then forced Ms Fletcher to assist him to put the property into her car. Ms Fletcher was ordered to drive to a service station where she was required to purchase cigarettes for him. She was then required to telephone an elderly friend at 5.30am for money. The two went to the friend’s home and collected $60. The applicant then dropped Ms Fletcher close to her home, drove away, transferred her property to his own vehicle and returned Ms Fletcher’s car to her.  
      
       
      
     8     
     The applicant had gained entry to the house by forcing a rear window.  
      
       
      
     9     
     The applicant was arrested on 18 September 1998. Items stolen from Ms Fletcher’s home were located in the applicant’s possession and in the possession of the applicant’s girlfriend. Jewellery, stolen from Ms Fletcher, was recovered from a pawn broker, having been pawned by the applicant and his girlfriend.  
      
       
      
     10     
     Ms Fletcher was not physically injured. She was, however, terrified during the episode.  
      
       
      
     11     
     The amount of property that was stolen exceeded $10,000 in value, according to the police statement of facts.  
      
       
      
     12     
     In her statement made on 2 August 1998, which was tendered as part of the Crown evidence on the sentencing hearing, Ms Fletcher said that the applicant had a 7” or 8” butcher’s knife held to her throat when she awoke and that he kept the knife in her sight all the time he was there. It is unnecessary for me to review her account of events. However, it contained the following details. The applicant said he did not want to hurt her. He said no-one was ever nice to him. He said he would not have broken into the house if he had known how old she was. He kept saying he did not want to do this. He seemed to be agitated. She objected to him taking her new iron and gave him her old one which he accepted. She objected to him taking some figurines which had belonged to a dead family member. He said he did not want to take anything of sentimental value. He allowed her to take the figurines back. She objected to him taking a concrete garden ornament which was in the lounge room and he left that. As they were carrying things to her car he enquired whether they were too heavy for her. He left a wooden model when she said that it had been given to her by her son. He was complimentary about the way her husband looked after his tools in the garage. While they were at the service station the applicant was sucking his thumb like a baby. The applicant said they had to decide what they were going to do with the car. She told him to take the car and let her out, that she would walk home. He said she was not walking home in the dark. He let her out of the car near her house. The applicant came back to the house and they went off again in the car. She told him that he should try and get himself out of this and join the methadone programme. He replied that he could not promise anything. He said he felt bad about this, that he would try and get her stuff back but it might take a while. They drove to where he had left his vehicle. Ms Fletcher said that the only time he raised his voice was when he first woke her up. At one stage he had pulled up his sleeve and had shown her some scars on his right forearm. 
      
       
      
     13     
     The applicant tendered a report by Dr Westmore dated 16 February 1999. The history taken by Dr Westmore included the following At the age of 16 he was admitted to Odyssey House for two years. He was taking heroin and cannabis at that time. He then remained drug free for six to twelve months. He then started using illicit drugs again at the age of 21, heroin and amphetamines. In 1992 he had sought treatment for depression and was under the care of the Bondi Mental Health Service for nine to ten months, receiving drug therapy. As at 2 August 1998 he was on the methadone programme but was using amphetamines. In the past he had been treated by his general practitioner with anti-depressants, commencing about three and a half years previously. As at 2 August 1998 he was off the anti-depressants temporarily for a change in medication. There had been an attempted suicide four years previously.  
      
       
      
     14     
     There was a family background of illicit drug usage. At the age of 11 the applicant had overdosed on cannabis, following which he was placed in an institution. His step-father died from a drug over dose. The applicant was placed in foster care from the age of 11. He was taking amphetamines intermittently from the age of 13 or 14. He started smoking heroin at the age of 14, intravenously from the age of 14 and a half. From the age of 19 he was using cocaine intermittently. He had also used Rohypnol and Serepax in the 12 months prior to August 1998.  
      
       
      
     15     
     The applicants childhood was disrupted by the separation of his parents at the age of two followed by frequent changes in where he lived and with whom. He was beaten by his step-mother and by his step-father. His step-sisters, who were older, forced him to have sexual relations with them.  
      
       
      
     16     
     He had worked as a hospital cleaner. He was then a male prostitute for 18 months from the age of 19. He then started dealing in cocaine at Kings Cross. On being barred from Kings Cross by the local police, he went to live in Nowra with a paternal uncle. There he acquired a girlfriend. He had not worked otherwise.

     Dr Westmore described the applicant as a very damaged young man. His early life history had been a disaster. He had suffered emotional abuse and deprivation and been the victim of physical and sexual abuse. He had poor role models as a child, being exposed to drug use and violence. There was an extensive history of illicit drug usage. He had suffered episodes of depression in the past, probably more on some occasions than others. He was a chronic thumb sucker. That was extremely regressive behaviour which reflected his level of insecurity. There had been previous attempts at drug rehabilitation without long term success. Dr Westmore was of the view that the applicant was in need of further extended periods of drug rehabilitation. Optimally, he required long term community based rehabilitation. His prognosis was uncertain in view of the long duration of drug use, the extent of it and the nature of the applicant’s personality difficulties.  
      
       
      
     18     
     Dr Westmore thought the applicant was probably chronically depressed and in need of psychiatric assistance. 
      
       
      
     19     
     Dr Westmore said the applicant was aware of the impact his behaviour had had on the victim in this matter and that his expressions of regret and remorse in that regard were probably genuine. 
      
       
      
     20     
     A report dated 13 July 1998 by Dr N.M. Wilton, psychiatrist, from the Illawarra Health Service at Shoalhaven, was tendered and also a psychiatrist assessment by Odyssey House dated 21 May 1993. I need not review these documents. 
      
       
      
     21     
     The applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. The applicant said he had taken a number of Rohypnol tablets prior to committing this offence. He did not recall leaving home that night. He said that, when he broke into the house, he thought it was unoccupied. He said he thought the knife he had with him was a butter knife. (That was not correct). He remembered loading up Ms Fletcher’s car with objects from the house. He remembered going to the service stations. He said he left the things which Ms Fletcher said were of sentimental value and that she cuddled him just before they left in her car. The applicant said that he did not feel very good about what he had done, or about the hurt and stress under which he had put the person under which, he said, he did not mean to do. 
      
       
      
     22     
     The applicant said he had been seeing a psychiatrist once every week or two in prison and was being trialed on Prozac instead of another anti-depressant. He also saw the welfare officer and the drug and alcohol counsellor every week. He was on the methadone programme and was reducing his methadone. He was trying to get his methadone level down to what was required for acceptance into a Salvation Army programme at Endeavour Farm. He hoped to participate in that programme at some stage.  
      
       
      
     23     
     The applicant said that he was in protective custody at his own request because, being young, he was in fear of being attacked.  
      
       
      
     24     
     In cross examination, the applicant at first denied that he had a 7” to 8” butcher’s knife, but then said that Ms Fletcher might be right in saying that he did. The applicant said he had been on Speed and had not slept for days. He said he had intended to break into a house to obtain money to buy cigarettes. He said that the idea of taking things from the house arose when he found that Ms Fletcher had a car. 
      
       
      
     25     
     In his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge said that some of Ms Fletcher’s conduct had been strange. I do not agree. She was obviously terrified that the applicant would use the knife. The applicant also said he had a gun and she was frightened he would use that. She did everything she could to keep him calm because she feared for her own physical safety.  
      
       
      
     26     
     It is also apparent that, after waking Ms Fletcher and threatening her with the knife at close quarters, the applicant showed a good deal of courtesy and consideration. That does not excuse what he did but it does say something about the sort of person he is underneath.  
      
       
      
     27     
     At the time of these offences, the applicant was drug dependent. He was also unemployed and presumably in need of money. It can be assumed that the motivating factor behind what occurred was the need for money to support the applicant’s drug habit. That does not qualify as a matter of mitigation. In  
     Henry 
     , 
      (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. 
      the Chief Justice said 
      At [202]. 
      that there is no warrant to assess a crime induced by a need for funds to feed a drug addiction as being lower on the scale of moral culpability than other perceived requirements for money. Wood CJ at CL said, in the same case, at [257-9], that the causal relationship between a drug habit and a commission of an offence, should not, as a matter of general principle, automatically lead to a lesser sentence. The way in which the need to acquire funds to support a drug habit could be relevant, although not a matter of mitigation in itself, was, however, explained by Wood CJ at CL at [273]. His Honour said that the fact that an offence is motivated by such a need may be taken into account as a factor relevant to the objective criminality of the offence insofar as it may throw light on a variety of matters including the impulsivity of the offence. His Honour said it may also be relevant as a subjective circumstance insofar as the addiction might have occurred at a very young age so that the ability to exercise appropriate judgment or choice was incomplete. These observations are relevant to the present case. There was in an element of impulsivity about this stealing episode and there is the fact that the applicant became dependent on drugs at a very early age. 
      
       
      
     28     
     On 21 June 1996 the applicant was at Kings Cross. He witnessed a man being chased along the street, being caught and being kicked viciously in the head. He rang for an ambulance. He was interviewed by the police and made a full statement about what he had observed. This was not without its hazards for the applicant; he was, at that time, selling drugs at Kings Cross. When the applicant came up for sentence in the present matter, he did not mention the assistance he had given the police in relation to the earlier matter because he did not think it was relevant. At that stage, he had not been asked to give evidence. Subsequent to sentence, he was asked to give evidence at the trial of the offender. He was brought to court from gaol and did so.  
      
       
      
     29     
     This court has power to receive evidence that was not, but could have been, placed before the sentencing judge:  
     Pyritz 
     . 
      Unreported, NSWCCA, 23 November 1998. 
      Very substantial reasons and a grave risk of injustice must be shown before such evidence is admitted:  
     McKenna 
     . 
      Unreported, NSWCCA, 16 October 1992. 
      The Crown concedes that this is an appropriate case in which to admit the evidence and that the consequence is that the sentence should be quashed and the applicant re-sentenced. The concession is a proper one and I agree that that is the appropriate course.  
      
       
      
     30     
     The assistance to the authorities given in this case is towards the lower end of the range.  
      
       
      
     31     
     I have regard to the objective circumstances of the case and to subjective considerations relative to the applicant. The offences are serious offences in themselves. This case is, however, far from the worst category of cases involving armed robbery and kidnapping. The applicant was affected by drugs at the time. This is not a matter in mitigation but, in view of the history of drug dependency extending back to childhood, that goes to the objective circumstances of the offending behaviour.  
      
       
      
     32     
     The applicant’s history of mental illness renders him an unsuitable vehicle for general deterrence.  
      
       
      
     33     
     Absent assistance to the authorities, which the sentencing judge did not know about, I agree with his Honour’s view that a total sentence of six years would be appropriate. Discounting for assistance to the authorities, I would impose a total sentence of five years penal servitude.  
      
       
      
     34     
     In view of the applicant’s history of mental illness and drug dependency, I think a full two years under intensive supervision is required for rehabilitation purposes when the applicant is released from prison. Accordingly, I find special circumstances and would fix a non-parole period of three years.  
      
       
      
     35     
     The orders I propose are as follows:- 
      
       
        
       1. Grant leave to appeal against sentence. 
        
       2. Allow the appeal. 
        
       3. Quash the sentence imposed on 3 June 1999. 
        
       4. Substitute a sentence of five years’ penal servitude, commencing on 18 September 1998, with a non-parole period of three years expiring on 17 September 2001, that being the date on which the applicant will be eligible to be released on parole.

     James JORDAN v Patricia O'SHANE & ors 
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal by the plaintiff pursuant to s 104 of the Justices Act 1902 seeking to set aside an order made by the first defendant pursuant to s 438 of the Crimes Act 1900, since repealed, for the return to the fourth defendant of property claimed to be the property of the fourth defendant. 
    2    The proceedings arise out of criminal proceedings taken against one Bill Aslanidis who was charged with stealing a billiard table and accessories, the property of the fourth defendant. In due course the second defendant, who is a Local Court Magistrate, found the offence proved but discharged Mr Aslanidis pursuant to s 556A of the Crimes Act, also since repealed. 
    3    According to the Bench Sheet, her Worship also made the following order: 
     
      
       
       ""Pursuant to provisions of s 438  
       Crimes Act 
        the Court is satisfied that the subject property was received by James Jordan, solicitor, contrary to the provisions of the  
       Crimes Act 
        and the order is made that the subject property be restored to Dr Michael Kefaloukas of Ramsgate."" 
       
      
    4    The plaintiff, Mr Jordan, was the person found in the possession of the billiard table and gave evidence for the prosecution in the proceedings against Mr Aslanidis. Although the whole transcript of the proceedings has been tendered I have not been invited to read it all and have not done so, my attention only being directed to the parts relevant to this appeal. 
    5    The Amended Summons named as defendants the Magistrate as first defendant, Senior Constable Phillip Taylor, the informant in the prosecution of Mr Aslanidis as second defendant, the Local Court of New South Wales as third defendant and Michael Kefaloukas the alleged owner of the billiard table as fourth defendant. 
    6    All defendants filed submitting appearances except as to costs, and Senior Counsel for the plaintiff indicated that his client did not seek costs against the fourth defendant, but did seek costs against the other defendants including the Magistrate. 
    7    The evidence discloses that although Mr Jordan gave evidence for the prosecution in the Local Court proceedings he was not happy with the attitude towards him displayed by the learned Magistrate; so much so that he wrote to the Judicial Commission of New South Wales formally complaining about her conduct, and subsequently he has commenced defamation proceedings against a Greek language newspaper in regard to its reporting of the proceedings. 
    8    The appeal before this Court was instituted outside the time fixed by SCR Pt 51 r 6(2)(a), but having regard to the material in the affidavit and the fundamental defect in the order that was made I am satisfied that the time for appealing should be extended and I so order. 
    9    The grounds of the appeal quite simply are that the application for the order under s 438 was made in the absence of the present plaintiff; he had no notice of the application and he was given no opportunity to respond to it and, accordingly, he was denied natural justice and procedural fairness. 
    10    As I say, all the defendants to the summons have filed submitting appearances except as to costs, and the plaintiff is clearly entitled to an order setting aside the order against which the appeal is brought. The main argument has been as to the costs. The transcript of the proceedings in the Local Court records no application being made for the order and a lot of the hearing time today has been directed to the question of whether an application had in fact been made for an order and, if so, who made it, when it was made and in what circumstances. 
    11    It was admitted that the prosecutor made the application, but she cannot now recall whether it was made on the date of sentencing or on a prior occasion. The making of the application is not recorded in the transcript and in those circumstances I infer that it was probably made after the sentencing process was complete. 
    12    It is not known whether it was made in the presence of Mr Aslanidis, the defendant in the Local Court proceedings, but I am satisfied that it was certainly made in the absence of the present plaintiff. 
    13    Mr Reynolds, Senior Counsel for the plaintiff, has referred me to the correspondence that his solicitors wrote to the solicitors for the first, second and third defendants respectively seeking information as to when, by whom, and in what circumstances the application for the order was made, and in those letters the point was made that in the absence of a response the principle of Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 would be relied on, and the Court would be asked to infer that no evidence which the respective defendants could give could assist their respective cases.  
    14    That is all very well but although the principle in that case is well known it does not extend to filling in gaps in the case of the party which carries the onus of proof and the failure to respond to those letters could not, of itself, constitute evidence or lead to any inference, that the first defendant had made the orders without any application of any kind being made to her. 
    15    The circumstances in which an order for costs will be made against a judicial officer are very limited and the principles are well established. Before an order could be made against a judicial officer it would be necessary to show positively that she had been guilty of serious misconduct, perversity and/or gross ignorance. Even without the admission subsequently made by Mr Spartalis there was, in my view, no evidence before the Court at any time that the Magistrate in making the order under s 438 had acted perversely or had been guilty of serious misconduct or gross ignorance, although she had clearly denied natural justice to the present plaintiff. The Clerk of the Local Court had merely sought to give effect to the orders made by the Magistrate. 
    16    Accordingly, no ground has been shown for making an order for costs against the first or third defendants.  
    17    In relation to the second defendant, I accept the evidence of Senior Constable Taylor that he did not make any application and did not give any instructions to the Police Prosecutor to make such an application. However, the Police Prosecutor appears in Local Court proceedings by leave as representative of the complainant and I am satisfied that in making the application the Police Prosecutor was acting on behalf of the complainant, Senior Constable Taylor; and as the Prosecutor made the application on his behalf and made it in the absence of the plaintiff, it is appropriate that Senior Constable Taylor be ordered to pay the plaintiff's costs of the appeal. 
    18    Appeals under Part 5 of the Justices Act are now governed by SCR Pt 51B r 10 which provides that where the tribunal appealed from is a court, such court shall not be joined as a defendant to the appeal. It follows that the summons commencing these proceedings should therefore have joined only the original complainant, Senior Constable Taylor and Dr Michael Kefaloukas the person who would be affected if the appeal were upheld. If that had been done these proceedings would have been short and simple, the appeal would have been upheld, and an order for costs against the original complainant made as a matter of course. 
    19    On behalf of the plaintiff costs are sought on a solicitor and client basis, however, although the Police Prosecutor acted somewhat ineptly in seeking the order in the absence of the plaintiff, I am satisfied that this was accidental and not done maliciously or contumeliously, and was probably through ignorance rather than anything else, and the costs will be on the ordinary party and party basis. 
    20    Notwithstanding the side issues that appear to have crept into the matter, I do not see that it required the engagement of senior counsel, particularly having regard to the value, or lack thereof, of the billiard table in question. 
    21    An application has been made on behalf of the first and third defendants that the plaintiff should pay their costs on the grounds that they have been involved in the proceedings because orders for costs have been sought against them and such costs have not been awarded. There is considerable merit in this application but, having regard to the amount involved in the proceedings, to make such an order would, substantially deprive the plaintiff of the benefit of bringing the proceedings and, therefore, I will not make any order in favour of costs for the first and third defendants.  
    22    Accordingly, I make the orders that I grant an extension of time for the institution of the appeal up to the date of the filing of the summons, the appeal is upheld, the ruling and finding of the Local Court pursuant to s 438 of the Crimes Act is set aside, I order the second defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of appeal and I make no order as to the costs of the first and third defendants. 
    23    All orders relating to costs are subject to the orders for costs of the day made on 7 August 2000. Exhibits may be returned.

     L00018 of 1996 Regina v Sidney Justin Bowtell 
      
       
    Reasons for determination1     HIS HONOUR: On 20 July 1989 at the Supreme Court in Wollongong the applicant, Sidney Justin Bowtell, was sentenced by Mathews J to penal servitude for life for manslaughter. His plea of guilty to that charge had been accepted by the Crown prosecutor in full satisfaction of an indictment for murder, on the basis of diminished responsibility. Pursuant to s13A of the Sentencing Act 1989, he applies for the determination of minimum and additional terms in respect of that sentence. (The Sentencing Act has since been repealed, and provision for these applications is now made by Schedule 1 to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.) 
     
      
       
      
    2     The offence occurred on 21 September 1988 and the circumstances of it were described by Mathews J as the worst she had ever encountered. In her remarks on sentence her Honour summarised them as follows:  
     
      
       
        
         
         The prisoner was seventeen at the time, walking in the evening in Keira Street, Wollongong. The victim, who was a small woman aged eighty-one, was a complete stranger to him. She was also walking in Keira Street, near the premises of Goodyear Tyre & Brake Service. The prisoner ran up to her from behind, grabbed her by the throat and dragged her into the Goodyear premises. There, according to his record of interview the following day, the prisoner held her around the throat with his left hand while he struck her four blows in the area of her chin. After that, he said she was dead. I must assume, however, from the injuries described by Dr Versoza, that the actual degree of violence was much greater than that. For not only were there generalised haematomas and abrasions throughout almost the whole of the victim’s scalp and facial areas, with associated contusions, but there was a complete fracture of the left jaw and a fracture of each of the third right and left ribs. Notwithstanding that the prisoner is a powerfully built, strong young man, and that the victim was a small, frail old lady, I do not see how four blows to the chin could possibly have caused these injuries.  
         
        
        
         
         Nor did the violence or indignities end there. It can only be a matter of relief that (the victim) was very probably dead, or at least unconscious, when the next appalling acts of degradation were perpetrated upon her body. For the prisoner then proceeded to remove her clothes and to sexually violate her in the worst conceivable manner. And although he subsequently denied that he was capable of achieving any real penetration of her body, that is entirely inconsistent with the medical evidence which reveals that there were horrible injuries in both vaginal and anal areas.  
         
        
        
         
         The prisoner then went through her purse from which he extracted some small change and one or two minor valuables. Finally he placed her naked body in an industrial waste bin.  
         
        
        
         
         Afterwards he left the area, took a cab back to his father’s home at Corrimal, and telephoned his estranged girlfriend … to tell her what he had done. By this time it was about one o’clock in the morning. He told her that he had used the victim’s clothes to wipe off his fingerprints. Which, in retrospect is a little strange; for at that stage he had not done so. It was only after this conversation that the prisoner returned to the scene where he used the victim’s scarf and beanie to wipe his fingerprints off the victim’s neck. He then again left the scene and caught a taxi back to Corrimal. This, according to the evidence took place at about 2.30 to 3.30 in the morning.  
         
        
        
         
         It was later on the morning of 22 September that the victim’s naked body was found in the bin and the police were called. Later that day the prisoner’s girlfriend contacted the police. The prisoner was duly arrested that evening, and a lengthy record of interview was conducted in the presence of his father. In it he admitted the killing and described the events which preceded and followed it. At that time he obviously had a clear recollection of the events of the previous night, although on my assessment he was already minimising the seriousness of his unspeakable actions. By the time he later spoke to the various psychiatrists who have examined him, he professed to have very little recollection indeed of the events of that night, as to which the psychiatrists generally were very sceptical. I share their scepticism.  
         
        
       
      
    3     At the time of the offence the applicant was on bail in respect of a charge of armed robbery. That offence had been committed by the applicant and a number of other juveniles, one of whom was armed with a replica pistol, in a street in Penrith on 10 August 1988. The applicant ran at the victim, a forty year-old man, tackling him to the ground. The victim got to his feet, but the juvenile who had the replica pistol menaced him with it and demanded money. On being told that he had no money, the young men seized his briefcase and wallet and ran off.  
     
      
       
      
    4     On his arrest for that offence the applicant was detained at Cobham Juvenile Shelter until he was released on bail on 15 August 1988. That bail was conditioned that he reside with his father at an address at Corrimal. On 20 March 1989 he was sentenced for the armed robbery to three years imprisonment, to date from 22nd September 1988, with a non-parole period of eighteen months. I shall return to that matter later in these reasons, as it has a bearing upon the outcome of this application. He has some earlier findings of guilt in Children’s Courts, which are of no present consequence. 
     
      
       
      
    5     Such explanation as there is for this brutal killing is to be found in the applicant’s background and his psychiatric state at the time. As observed, he was then seventeen years old. He is now twenty-nine. He was born in Queensland and has a younger brother who, apparently, has not been in conflict with the law. His parents separated when he was two years old and he spent most of his time with his father, living a somewhat itinerant existence because of the requirements of his father’s employment in the building industry. His early home life was uneventful but, because of his low intelligence, he performed poorly at school. With a history of truancy, he left school at the age of about thirteen. At the time he was sentenced the evidence before her Honour was that he was functionally illiterate. 
     
      
       
      
    6     In his early teens he moved to New South Wales, where he stayed mainly with his father but, at times, with his mother. He became a very heavy drinker and also used marijuana to excess. His employment was sporadic and he developed no work skills of any value. However, there was a period of some stability in 1987 when he worked regularly for his father as a bricklayer in the Campbelltown area.  
     
      
       
      
    7     In January 1988 the applicant commenced an intimate relationship with the woman to whom Mathews J referred as his girlfriend. That relationship was as intense as it was inappropriate. She was twenty years his senior. She had previously had a relationship with his father, and her eldest son was one year older than he. Mathews J observed that he “became utterly obsessed with this woman and by their relationship”. He had had a history of unpredictable and irrational mood swings and had occasionally indulged in acts of self-mutilation, but it was during this relationship that he demonstrated a propensity for significant violence towards others. When they argued he would smash things in the home, and on occasions he struck her. However, as her Honour observed, the level of violence escalated when things started to go wrong with the relationship.  
     
      
       
      
    8     It was because of difficulties in the relationship that the applicant went to a shelter in the Penrith area in about July 1988. He was in the company of other residents of the shelter when he was involved in the armed robbery to which I have referred, in the following month. Despite the bail condition that he reside with his father, he sought to re-establish his relationship with the woman, only to find that she wished to terminate it. He could not accept this, he telephoned her constantly, he attempted to harm himself and generally behaved in what her Honour described as “an entirely erratic and irrational fashion”.  
     
      
       
      
    9     Ultimately, the woman told the applicant that she had commenced another relationship, as it happens, with a man who had previously been his youth counsellor and whom he had trusted. He was utterly distraught. He tried to crash a motor car in which he and she were travelling and, on a later occasion, chased her new lover with a crow-bar.  
     
      
       
      
    10     On the day of the killing the applicant was living with his father, but he was not working. He was drinking throughout the day. In the evening he went to a club at Wollongong with some friends but they left without him. He also left on foot and eventually found himself in Keira Street, Wollongong where he saw the unfortunate victim. In a recorded interview with police he said, “I was just thinking of my ex-girlfriend and how to get revenge and I just got real angry and I just wanted to let my aggression out and I seen this lady. I walked up behind her and started strangling her and punching her.” He went on to describe having sexually assaulted her. As her Honour put it, “He vented his anger in unimaginable respects”.  
     
      
       
      
    11     Her Honour had the benefit of psychiatric reports by Dr John Robert Strum, Dr C L Wong, Dr William Barclay and Dr Thomas Clark. Reviewing his background, all four psychiatrists concluded that the applicant suffered from a Borderline Personality Disorder, which triggered his extreme reaction to the break-up of the relationship. All considered that the elements of the defence of diminished responsibility were established. Dr Wong and Dr Barclay expressed no opinion about the applicant’s prognosis. Dr Clark described it as “very much guarded”, although he added that people suffering from that disorder “do tend to settle in their mid to late twenties”. Dr Strum, on the other hand, was most pessimistic. His report concluded as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         I must stress that this man is incurable, violent, incapable of learning or of changing, and is a danger to be at large. He has shown clearly the extent of his violent response to frustration and, unfortunately, life is such that people will always find situations of frustration. His inability to learn was evident in his failed schooling, his inability to take notice of prohibitions and his inability to accept rejection. He acts on impulse and not with planning. He was unable to control his rages and his predilection for mixtures of alcohol and marijuana, a combination which I believe is like a fuse to the dynamite of his personality disorder, will make him a danger in the future. 
         
        
       
      
    12     This was the view which her Honour accepted and it was influential in her decision to impose the maximum sentence then provided by law, notwithstanding the applicant’s youth. After referring to Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465, her Honour concluded that any mitigation which might have been afforded by the applicant’s personality disorder was “entirely off-set” by the fact that it also meant that he was “a real danger to society”. Her Honour considered that the need for retribution called for a sentence of penal servitude for life, given the gravity of the crime. She added: 
     
      
       
        
         
         The concept of protection of society similarly indicates that this man should not be released into the community unless and until an assessment is made that it is safe to do so. Only one sentence can achieve that result… 
         
        
       
      
    13     Her Honour noted reports that the applicant had responded well to programs in the juvenile institution at which he had been held. She recommended that he should be detained in such an institution for as long as it was deemed appropriate for his welfare.  
     
      
       
      
    14     Despite that recommendation, it appears that the applicant has been detained in adult institutions since sentence was passed, mainly at Lithgow and Grafton. His response to imprisonment has followed a pattern familiar in cases such as these. Initially, he was depressed to the point of being suicidal and did not adapt well to prison discipline. A psychological report of August 1989 described him as “a confused, immature and inadequate young man” who exhibited “deficient coping skills” and “limited insight”. However, the numerous reports furnished to me demonstrate a gradual maturation over the ensuing years, with a proper appreciation of the enormity of his crime and the development of a positive outlook for the future. 
     
      
       
      
    15     He was on protection until early in 1995. There have been incidents of aggressive or disruptive behaviour and, at an earlier stage, of self-inflicted injury. Generally, however, there has been a marked improvement in his conduct. He has partaken in a variety of courses and has furthered his general education, obtaining his school certificate in 1998. A report of July 1999 of Miss Lorraine Seale, education officer at Grafton, speaks most highly of his application and achievement in this area.  
     
      
       
      
    16     He has also undertaken courses in personal development and drug and alcohol counselling, again earning favourable reports from those dealing with him. In a report of January 2000 Mr Colin Wysocki, a counsellor at Grafton, observed:  
     
      
       
        
         
         He now has a clear goal of abstinence from all drugs which, due to his diligence, he should achieve. He acknowledges a history of alcohol and other drug use prior to incarceration, but due to a sincere attempt at rehabilitation he has continued to strengthen this area through his participation in personal growth.  
         
        
       
      
    17     In the following month another counsellor, Ms Judith Jaworski, reported that he was aware of the importance of abstinence, particularly from alcohol. It appeared to her that he had not taken alcohol while in prison, despite the ready availability of “home brews”. Nevertheless, he acknowledged to her that he had been using cannabis, as he did in evidence before me. He was equally frank about his use of that drug in a consultation with Dr Robert Delaforce, psychiatrist, in July 1999, saying that he planned to continue to use it recreationally upon his release from prison. I shall return to that matter in a moment. 
     
      
       
      
    18     He is fortunate to have had the benefit of regular contact with Ms C A Drayden-Thompson, psychologist, at Grafton since January 1996. It was she who suspected that he suffered from attention deficit disorder and who recommended, for that reason, that he be assessed by Dr Delaforce. In May 1997 Dr Delaforce diagnosed Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and prescribed appropriate medication. 
     
      
       
      
    19     As Dr Delaforce explained in evidence, this is a most significant development. The disorder provides a new found insight into the applicant’s aberrant behaviour in the past, including his unacceptable conduct whilst in prison, and its diagnosis and treatment bode well for the future. The medication has led to a marked improvement in his concentration and perseverance, as well as his ability to deal with conflict in a mature way.  
     
      
       
      
    20     He expressed his remorse for his crime to Dr Delaforce, saying that he felt “disgusted” at what he had done and acknowledging the suffering of the relatives of the unfortunate victim. He repeated that expression of remorse in evidence before me. Dr Delaforce accepted it as genuine, as do I. He has the benefit of the continuing support of his father and his brother. It seems that, whilst in prison, he formed an association with a woman who has two sons. That relationship has not endured, but he has kept in touch with them and feels a measure of fatherly responsibility for the boys. That contact may well be a further source of stability when he is released into the community. More recently, he has had contact with a Christian group which visits prisoners, and which he described as “a very supportive network”. 
     
      
       
      
    21     I have been greatly assisted by a report of Ms Drayden-Thompson of 11 February 2000 and the report of Dr Delaforce of 9 September 1999, together with his oral evidence. I have been impressed by the insight and realism of the approach of both these experts. Ms Drayden-Thompson’s report concludes: 
     
      
       
        
         
         Clinical impressions gained in one to one interaction with Mr Bowtell are that he has made progress in personal growth and has achieved gains in self control and communication skills. Mr Bowtell harbours realistic aspirations such as gaining employment and reconnecting with his family. He perceives that his main difficulty will be in re-adjusting to life in the community. He came to gaol as a juvenile of 17 years with a mental age of about 13 (as a result of his drug and alcohol abuse). Thus Mr Bowtell has a lot of growing up to do away from the very artificial and abnormal environment of the prison system. It is considered that he has been counselled in relation to his choice of lifestyle and his vulnerabilities, and he is aware of community resources and is willing to utilise them if necessary. Mr Bowtell displays sufficient maturity, in that he is willing to seek the assistance of others if problems arise. He has a more than adequate support network and the personal resources to make the adjustment, however would benefit from psychological counselling during the period after release. Clinical impressions are that Mr Bowtell has made significant progress in personal growth, and is capable of, and ready for re-entry into the community. Any further progress in his personal development and maturity, can best be achieved with support in the community. 
         
        
       
      
    22     In addition to ADHD, Dr Delaforce diagnosed what he described as a Personality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. He considered that the applicant has some of the personality features of Antisocial Personality Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder, but did not satisfy the criteria for diagnosis of either of them. In evidence, he said that the Antisocial Personality Disorder features encompassed his behavioural problems in childhood and his earlier criminal activity, including the armed robbery. The features of Borderline Personality Disorder were his unstable personality, his difficulty in controlling his anger and dealing with the break-up of relationships, and his lack of identity and purpose in life.  
     
      
       
      
    23     The doctor noted a significant abatement of those features in recent times, and he explained that the current view of psychiatrists is that personality disorders generally are not as inflexible and pervasive as they were earlier believed to be. It is this, together with the diagnosis of ADHD, which caused him to question the gloomy prognosis of Dr John Strum at the time of sentence. In his report he wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Dr Strum’s 1989 opinion that Mr Bowtell was “incurable, violent, incapable of learning or of changing, and is a danger to be at large”, had some influence on Mr Bowtell receiving a life sentence. Ten years later the progress of psychiatry allows it to be reasonably said that although Personality Disorders are generally associated with negative outcomes, they often show some improvement over time, and usually during the fourth decade of life. Generally they have been regarded as treatment resistant however, some gains from psychotropic (psychiatric) medication and other types of therapy have been noted. That is, and working here from the perspective of a current Personality Disorder with antisocial and borderline features, one does not have to be totally pessimistic, but instead appropriately cautious about the outcome. 
         
        
        
         
         Another important consideration is that a comorbid mental disorder, such as ADHD, can change the prognosis. There are good indications here of a very favourable response to stimulant medication. However, that alone does not counter any effects of the Personality Disorder but can nevertheless favourably influence the overall state of mental health.” 
         
        
       
      
    24     The doctor added that the whole of the information available to him “indicates that there has been a definite improvement in his mental health functioning during the 1990s, which in itself counters the notion implied in 1989 that he would never change”. Turning to the question of future dangerousness, he noted that the applicant was not free of “significant problems with his personality functioning”, and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
         
          “It is reasonably likely but not quite probable, that he would criminally offend if released from prison in the foreseeable future. Most likely this would be associated with substance use, which he will probably return to, which will represent a potent determinant of his future violence. There are no significant indications that he would re-offend in a manner similar to the 1988 offence, either with such severe physical violence or sexual assault. He is more likely to offend with violence of much lesser severity, for example, the result of a fight in a hotel or club. 
         
        
        
         
         What needs particular emphasis here is that the 1988 crime followed a period of heightened stress, the end of a relationship with a woman, at a time he was already struggling to cope adequately and has insufficient personal resources or assistance to deal with such a loss. With the passage of time, increasing maturity, and the experience he gained from his treatment and his prison relationships, one of which ended during his imprisonment, he would likely deal much better with stress. 
         
        
       
      
    25     I turn, then, to the applicant’s continued use of cannabis. He explained in evidence that he used it occasionally, rather than daily, and that he did so partly as a result of peer pressure and partly to help him deal with stress. He added that, in the months which have passed since he spoke to Ms Jaworski and Dr Delaforce, he had come to realise that it was undesirable and he hoped, with further counselling, to give it up. I suspect that that will not be easy for him but it is most important that he does so. Dr Delaforce expressed his concern about the matter in evidence, although he acknowledged the applicant’s openness and honesty about the matter, which he saw as a positive sign. 
     
      
       
      
    26     Two other matters should be noted. The Crown prosecutor raised the possibility that the sexual aspect of the applicant’s crime arose from some deep seated and enduring sexual problem. The applicant denied this, saying that his behaviour “was something that was totally out of character for that specific moment in time” and that the memory of it sickened him. In this he was supported by the evidence of Dr Delaforce, who saw the sexual acts as part of the extreme violence which the applicant perpetrated upon the deceased which, in turn, was consistent with his personality disorder. He added that the applicant has had a deal of contact with health care professionals over the years he has been in prison, and he believed that any sexual deviancy would have been identified. That is the view which I take.  
     
      
       
      
    27     It seems that in January 1999 a prison officer’s report expressed concern that the applicant “might be a ring-leader, stand-over person in the prison, and involved in the movement of drugs about the prison”. The applicant denied this allegation in evidence, believing it to have emanated from another prisoner with whom he had come into conflict. It is inconsistent with the other reports about him and there is no evidence to support it. I reject it. 
     
      
       
      
    28     In summary, the applicant has made considerable progress towards his rehabilitation and should now be able to look forward to a date when he will be eligible for parole. While the risk of his re-offending must be acknowledged, there is good reason to believe that, with appropriate supervision and support, he can achieve a satisfactory and law abiding lifestyle in the community. I am confident that the extreme violence which he perpetrated upon that unfortunate woman in 1988 is now a thing of the past. 
     
      
       
      
    29     None of this, of course, is to deny the enormity of his crime. That is evident from a recitation of the objective facts. I received in evidence a victim impact statement of the daughter of the deceased. (The status of statements of that kind was examined by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Previtera (1997) 94 ACrim R 76 at 84ff.) It speaks eloquently of the profound and enduring effects of the crime upon her and her siblings. Many of us have had to learn to accept the loss of someone dear to us who was elderly and overtaken by ill-health. It is quite another matter to come to terms with the violent death of a loved one, particularly in circumstances as horrific and senseless as these. To those relatives I express my deepest sympathy, as would any right thinking member of this community.  
     
      
       
      
    30     It is entirely understandable that the deceased’s daughter urges that the applicant should never be released. That, of course, is not an option open to me. Mathews J sentenced him at a time when most life sentence prisoners could expect to be released into the community eventually and, from the passage in her remarks on sentence which I have quoted at par 12 of these reasons, it is apparent that her Honour envisaged that a time might come when the applicant would be fit for release. My task is to arrive at a total sentence and a minimum term which reflect the gravity of the crime while making proper allowance for the applicant’s background, his age, his mental state at the time and his considerable strides towards rehabilitation during his imprisonment. I must also have regard to the fact that he has spent about five years on protection.  
     
      
       
      
    31     The Crown prosecutor raised the question whether this application should be refused at this stage on the basis that it is premature, but he did not press a submission to that effect. Clearly, the application should be granted for the reasons expressed in the authorities to which I referred in dealing with the application in R v Patrick Francis Horan (unreported, 20 March 1998) at p13ff. What the Crown prosecutor did urge, however, was that I should fix a lengthy minimum term, calculated to reflect the seriousness of the crime, and an additional term for the remainder of the applicant’s life. Counsel for the applicant acknowledged that the minimum term must be substantial, even allowing for favourable subjective matters, but he argued for a determinate additional term. 
     
      
       
      
    32     To impose a total sentence of imprisonment for life would be open to me, even though the maximum for manslaughter is now 25 years: R v Leaver (CCA, unreported, 23 November 1994). However, I could do so only if I were satisfied that the case fell into the worst category of manslaughter, so as to call for the maximum sentence provided by law. The legislation requires me to have regard to the reasoning of the original sentencing judge and I would, of course, afford great weight to the views of a judge as experienced and as compassionate as Mathews J. However, as I have recorded in pars 11 & 12 of these reasons, an important factor in her Honour’s decision to impose the life sentence, despite the applicant’s youth, was the gloomy prognosis of Dr Strum. In the light of the evidence before me, that outlook can no longer be maintained. I have given this aspect of the matter anxious consideration, and I am persuaded that the total sentence should be a determinate period.  
     
      
       
      
    33     I have not found the assessment of the appropriate minimum term any easier. Counsel took me to Leaver and Horan, which were applications similar to this, and to the remarks on sentence of Hunt CJ at CL in Previtera. I have found those cases of some assistance although, as one would expect, the differences between them and the present case are as significant as the similarities. I do not propose to summarise them for the purpose of these reasons. Obviously, should the applicant be released on parole, it is desirable that he be subject to supervision and the sanction of parole for a lengthy period. 
     
      
       
      
    34     As I observed at the outset of these reasons, this application was made under the Sentencing Act and it was heard before the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 came into force. Schedule 2 to that Act contains transitional provisions, from which it appears that I should deal with the application in accordance with the Sentencing Act: see cl 21(2) of the Schedule. However, I shall hear the parties on that matter before making any formal order. Apart from the form of my order, the relevant provisions of both Acts are the same.  
     
      
       
      
    35     I am required to date the minimum term which I set from the day on which the applicant was first remanded in custody in respect of this offence. That was 23 September 1998, he having been arrested the previous evening. As I have recorded in par 4 of these reasons, the three year sentence for the armed robbery was to date from 22 September 1988. That sentence was passed under the Probation and Parole Act 1983 (since repealed). What has been described as a non-parole period of eighteen months would in fact have been a non-probation period, within the meaning of s5 of that Act. By s11(1), the applicant would have been entitled to release on probation at the expiration of that period. Both the head sentence and the non-probation period would then have been subject to reduction by remissions, and it is likely that he would have been released after about twelve months. It is upon that basis that I take the armed robbery sentence into account in arriving at the minimum term which I must impose. 
     
      
       
      
    36     The application is granted. My intention is that, in lieu of the life sentence imposed by Mathews J, the applicant should serve a total sentence of 21 years imprisonment, with a minimum term of 15 years, dating from 23 September 1988. That minimum term would expire on 22 September 2003 and he would be eligible for release on parole on the following day. After hearing from the parties about the appropriate procedure, I shall pronounce formal orders to that effect.

     R v Colin Alfred GUST (No. 2) 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1    DUNFORD J: The applicant, Colin Alfred Gust, was convicted in the District Court at East Maitland following his trial before Acting Judge Nader QC and a jury on a charge of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900. 
    2    He appealed to this Court on a number of grounds and also applied for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed following that conviction. 
    3    The appeal was heard by this Court as presently constituted on 29 July 1999 and judgment was delivered on 22 October 1999. The Court by majority dismissed his appeal against the conviction, and granted leave to appeal against sentence but dismissed the appeal. The judgment has since been perfected, the records indicating that that occurred on 3 November 1999. The applicant now seeks leave to re-open the hearing of the appeal on the ground that he was denied procedural fairness at the hearing and in the dismissal of the appeal. 
    4    It has been clearly established since Grierson v The King (1938) 60 CLR 431 that when this Court has heard an appeal on its merits and given its decision, the appeal cannot be re-opened. This principle has been reasserted by the High Court as recently as 1997 in Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 300, 315, 326; although it would appear that it is still open to this Court to entertain an application to remedy a denial of procedural fairness whether or not its order has been perfected: Pantorno v The Queen (1989) 166 CLR 466, see Postiglione at 300, 327. 
    5    In R v Lloyd Saxon (1998) 101 A Crim R 71 this Court reaffirmed the authority of Grierson but noted some exceptions to the principle including ""the discretion to look at the matter afresh where there has been a denial of procedural fairness in a Court of Criminal Appeal"" and Pantorno and R v McNamara (No. 2) 1997 1 VR 257 (1996) 86 A Crim R 339 were cited. 
    6    Accordingly, I am satisfied that this Court has power to grant the application if the applicant can show that he was in fact denied procedural fairness in the hearing and determination of his appeal. 
    7    In the judgment delivered on 22 October, Smart AJ and myself found none of the grounds of appeal established. Hidden J, whilst agreeing with us on some grounds, would have upheld the appeal and ordered a new trial on the ground that the learned trial judge was in error in giving the jury directions about recklessness as to consent in accordance with s 61R(1) Crimes Act 1900, and in failing to explain to the jury how such directions related to the evidence in the trial. Smart AJ and I took a different view. Smart AJ considered that, having regard to the way the evidence unfolded and because of the limited materials available, it was hard to rule out recklessness completely; but in any event even if recklessness was incorrectly left to the jury this did not cause a miscarriage of justice. I took the view that even if the directions were not necessary that did not entitle the applicant to a new trial. 
    8    Like all other grounds of appeal argued, this ground required leave because of the requirements of Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. Not only was no objection taken to the directions but counsel appearing for the applicant at the trial, who was different to counsel on the appeal and different to counsel who has appeared today, had expressly acquiesced in the giving of the directions and their terms. 
    9    As pointed out by Smart AJ in his judgment of 22 October 1999 at paras [67] - [68], the trial judge furnished counsel with draft directions prior to their addresses and there was no objection. This was followed by discussion between counsel and the judge as to the use to be made of the complainant's evidence. Subsequently his Honour summed up, presumably in accordance with the draft directions to which counsel had previously agreed. At the conclusion of the summing up both counsel expressed themselves as satisfied with the directions given.  
    10    Subsequently, a note was received from the jury requesting further directions in relation to recklessness. His Honour gave further directions in relation to that and another matter, at the conclusion of which both counsel again expressed their satisfaction with the directions which had been given. 
    11    Both Smart AJ and myself referred in our judgments to the fact that as the final addresses of both counsel were not before us we had no way of knowing whether anything about recklessness had been touched on in such addresses, but this was not fundamental to our respective reasons.  
    12    It is now submitted that there was a denial of procedural fairness because the Court did not give counsel notice, and counsel could not have anticipated that the Court might act upon what might have been said or not said in the addresses.  
    13    In his affidavit sworn in support of this application, counsel who appeared for the applicant on the hearing of the appeal said that when he received the Crown submissions he did not believe recklessness had been an issue at the trial and he asked for a transcript of the Crown's address to reassure himself of this. Such transcript was obtained and his belief confirmed. The appeal was not reached when listed for hearing on 4 March 1999 and was re-listed on 29 July when counsel did not turn his mind again to the issue of the trial addresses. We have now been provided with copies of such addresses and in fact the issue of recklessness in relation to consent was not referred to. 
    14    This is a case where as a consequence of Rule 4 the appellant needed leave to argue the ground, and it was therefore up to appellant's counsel to put to the Court all relevant material and submissions. His submission was that the direction should not have been given because recklessness was not an issue in the trial, and one way of demonstrating this would have been to produce the transcript of the Crown's final address containing no reference to that issue. What the present submission really amounts to is that counsel for the appellant overlooked some material which he could have used to support a submission which he was making. This is not intended as a criticism of counsel, he had a lot of issues to deal with and my recollection is that he conducted the appeal with his usual high degree of competency and ability. 
    15    Our attention has been directed to Rule 6 of the Criminal Appeal Rules which provides, inter alia, that the addresses shall not be included in the transcript unless the trial judge so orders, but that does not mean that if counsel had sought to rely on it and had produced it, it would not have been received by this Court. 
    16    The fact that the Court did not draw his attention to the absence of a transcript of the addresses specifically in relation to the ground relating to the recklessness direction, did not in my view amount to a denial of procedural fairness or natural justice. The Court had no way of knowing that which counsel knew of but overlooked, namely that he did have available to him a transcript of the Crown's address. In any event I did during the Crown's submissions refer to the apparent non-availability of the transcript of the addresses (see appeal transcript at p 24), but it must be conceded that that was in the context of submissions relating to another of the grounds of appeal. 
    17    I know of no authority, and we were not referred to any, which suggests that a judge must draw counsel's attention to every point or subsidiary consideration which he or she may later wish to refer to in formulating reasons for judgment. A Court is under no duty to a party to advise him how to present his case, the Court's duty is to give him a reasonable opportunity to present his case, and the responsibility of counsel for the conduct of the case cannot be assumed by the Court, for that would compromise its evenhandedness: Pantorno v The Queen at 472-3.  
    18    In any event, the absence of any reference to recklessness in the address would have made no difference to my judgment, the ratio of which appears in paras [5] and [6]. The reference to the absence of the transcript of addresses in para [4] was from my point of view only a passing remark. 
    19    Accordingly, I am not satisfied that there was any denial of procedural fairness in the present case and accordingly the application should be dismissed. 
    20    HIDDEN J: I agree. 
    21    SMART AJ: I also agree. 
    22    DUNFORD J: The order of the Court will therefore be as I have indicated.

     2     
     GROVE J : 
       
      This is an appeal against conviction for buggery following a trial before Knight DCJ and a jury in Dubbo District Court. The particulars of offence charged that it occurred between 1 and 25 December 1979. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The challenge to conviction is focussed upon relatively limited grounds and it will suffice to sketch the background facts briefly before turning to them.  
      
       
      
     4     
     The complainant was a child of a broken home and resided intermittently with various adult family members. In 1979 he came to the Sydney area to reside with his father who had been serving in the army. He made the acquaintance of the appellant who was in the army reserve. Then aged fifteen, the complainant had a falling out with his father and went to reside with a friend although he continued to attend school. On the last day of school term he was arrested by police in connection with an offence committed in company with the friend with whom he was residing. He was placed in a detention centre and brought before a court when he was released upon probation. It is not necessary to trace alleged understandings or misunderstandings of the terms of that probation. The relevant facts include that the complainant went to reside in a caravan to be shared with the appellant. This caravan was situated in property belonging to other persons. Whilst residing in those circumstances the appellant committed sexual assaults upon the complainant including the alleged act of buggery.  
      
       
      
     5     
     For reasons which the complainant later gave, he did not complain to police until approximately 1996. The appellant was ultimately charged and as the course of trial, to which I will next turn, shows he did not dispute committing the indecent assaults but denied committing buggery. 
      
       
      
     6     
     On 16 August 1999 the appellant was indicted upon three counts of indecent assault and one count of buggery. The record of proceedings shows his arraignment upon these counts in the presence of a jury panel. He pleaded guilty to the three counts of indecent assault and not guilty to the count of buggery. A jury of twelve was struck from the panel and a trial upon the contested count proceeded.  
      
       
      
     7     
     On the following day (17 August) it was drawn to his Honour’s attention that an article had been published in the Daily Liberal and Macquarie Advocate, a newspaper circulating in the Dubbo area in which the following appeared under the headline “Indecent Assault Matter in Court”: 
      
       
        
         
         “A man charged with indecently assaulting 11 different children all under the age of 17 years appeared in Dubbo District Court yesterday. 
         
        
        
         
         Police searched everyone entering the courtroom to protect the safety of the man who cannot be identified because of a suppression order requested by defence solicitors. 
         
        
        
         
         The man sat quietly in the dock as solicitors negotiated the conditions of the trial which is expected to last several weeks. 
         
        
        
         
         The jury was allowed into the courtroom several hours later for the start of the trial. 
         
        
        
         
         Prosecuting solicitors suggested the man’s case could be dealt with by way of up to five separate trials to run consecutively with separate juries. 
         
        
        
         
         The man, who faces a lengthy prison sentence if found guilty of the charges, was granted bail for the duration of the trial.” 
         
        
       
      
     8     
     In response to a joint submission on behalf of the Crown and the appellant, the learned trial judge discharged the jury without verdict. He refused a further application on behalf of the appellant that the further trial be adjourned to some future date in lieu of striking a new jury from a fresh panel which his Honour had been informed would become available on the following day.  
      
       
      
     9     
     On 18 August the appellant was arraigned before the panel summoned for that day on the single count charging buggery to which he pleaded not guilty. There is no complaint about the regularity of the conduct of that trial which concluded in the return of a guilty verdict by the jury. As counsel for the appellant noted with candour in his written submissions, the trial itself covered issues of very short compass and “but for the intervention of an external factor in the newspaper there may have been less basis for questioning a jury verdict plainly based on the acceptance of (the complainant’s) account beyond reasonable doubt and the implicit rejection of the appellant’s evidence of denial as raising the basis for reasonable doubt.” 
      
       
      
     10     
     The grounds of appeal are expressed as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The learned trial judge erred, having discharged a jury in the first trial of the present matter as a consequence of prejudicial publicity, in: 
         
        
        
         
         1(a) Not adjourning the recommenced trial to a date more distant than the next day of sitting. 
         
        
        
         
          (b) Not adjourning the recommenced trial to a different venue. 
         
        
        
         
         2. Not discharging the jury in the recommenced trial upon evidence falling from the complainant which was likely to confirm to the jury the prejudicial matters which had brought about the discharge of the first jury.” 
         
        
       
      
     11     
     The ingredients of complaint are allied and there is no need to deal with them separately. In addition, and expressly contingent upon the outcome of the appeal against conviction, the appellant sought leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by Knight DCJ when he dealt with the conviction on the count for buggery as well as nineteen further sexual assault offences.  
      
       
      
     12     
     Although for my part I express some reservation about the proposition that the evidence could not reasonably be made available at trial, or more particularly, at the time of the relevant application, there has been received affidavit evidence that in the week of 16 August 1999 there was only one District Court sitting in Dubbo and that the circulation of the newspaper in which the article complained of was published was approximately 4000 in the city of Dubbo. In his judgment on the issue, Knight DCJ had observed that the population of Dubbo approximated 38,000 people and that (for jury purposes) it draws upon a far greater number in the surrounding area. 
      
       
      
     13     
     It is undisputed that Knight DCJ was exercising a discretionary power and the principles applicable to the restraint upon intervention by appellate courts have been stated so often as not to require restatement now. Counsel for the appellant and for the Crown have diligently collected cases which have dealt with complaint about potential prejudice to fair trial by reason of adverse publicity. Each case must turn upon its own facts and the situation was neatly summarized by Street CJ in  
     R v George  
     1987 29 A Crim R 380 when he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The principle is essentially one that places responsibility upon the trial judge to determine, in the light of the atmosphere of the trial and the nature and extent of the publicity, whether it is necessary to discharge the jury in the interests of ensuring a fair trial.” 
         
        
       
      
     14     
     It was the learned trial judge’s view that the risk of potential prejudice could be met by appropriate direction to the jury. In due course he cautioned them firmly to hearken to their duty to decide the case upon the evidence and not to allow their deliberations to be contaminated by extraneous matter from inappropriate sources. The main thrust of the argument on behalf of the appellant asserted that the most damaging impacts of the article were the revelation that eleven children under the age of seventeen years were involved and that five separate trials might be run consecutively with separate juries. Attention was drawn to the concession that the publication created significant prejudice which might not be overcome by direction. Of course, that prejudice related to the first trial then in progress. 
      
       
      
     15     
     The article complained of refers to assaulting eleven different children and the possibility of five separate trials. The jury empanelled in the second trial became aware from the outset that the appellant was being tried in respect of a single count concerning a single complainant. It is true that lawyers would have an appreciation of arrangements for separate trials and the severance of counts in indictments but it would not be unrealistic to suggest that a juror would think that a person charged with a single count did not fit the description of the accused described in the newspaper article. 
      
       
      
     16     
     Ground 2 is sought to be supported by the assertion that it was discovered towards the end of the trial that a local police officer’s wife was a member of the jury. By specific amendment to the Jury Act, spouses of police officers and of others, including judges, were removed from the category of disqualification. In answer to a question in cross examination concerning the possible entitlement to compensation the complainant testified that he became aware of an entitlement when he was picked up at the airport on the previous Sunday by a police officer. It is contended that the combination of the relationship of the juror to a police officer and this remark produces a potential prejudice which bespeaks miscarriage of justice. I would reject the contention. In my opinion no ground for interference with the exercise of discretion by Knight DCJ has been made out. 
      
       
      
     17     
     As I have already observed, there has been no complaint about the conduct of the trial as such and it is not contended that this court should intervene other than on the basis of the grounds expressed. It should be borne in mind, however, that when there has been a refusal to discharge a jury followed by conviction, the appeal is against the conviction and not against the refusal to discharge:  
     R v Maric 
      1978 52 ALJR 631. 
      
       
      
     18     
     I would dismiss the appeal. The application for leave to appeal against the overall sentence was contingent upon the appellant’s success in the appeal against conviction and I therefore propose the following orders: 
      
       
      
     19     
     That the appeal against conviction be dismissed and that application for leave to appeal against sentence be refused. 
      
       
      
     20     
     BEAZLEY JA: I agree. 
      
       
      
     21     
     KIRBY J: Whilst I am confident that were I confronted by a similar application to that which came before Knight DCJ in this trial I would have adjourned the trial to a date more distant than the day after that application, that is not the test. The test is as outlined by Grove J. I agree that the appeal should be dismissed. 
      
       
      
     22     
     BEAZLEY JA: The orders of the Court are as proposed by Grove J.

    Facts 
     
      
    The Appellant killed his wife and older daughter and attempted also to kill his younger daughter. At his trial the only issue was the defence of insanity. The jury returned verdicts of guilty for the two murder charges and the one attempted murder charge. The Appellant appealed arguing that the trial judge, Newman J, did not explain to the jury adequately the second limb of the M’Naghten test, that his Honour was obliged to leave the question of diminished responsibility to the jury and that his Honour’s questioning of one of the expert witnesses deprived the Appellant of a fair trial. It was also argued that the verdicts could not be supported by the evidence and, alternatively, that they should be quashed in the light of fresh evidence. 
     
      
     
     
      
    Held(per Spigelman CJ, James and Sperling JJ agreeing)a Insanity Defence1 The evidence that the Appellant was suffering from a “disease of the mind” was before the jury with a degree of clarity that did not call for repetition by the trial judge. His Honour’s direction on the second limb of the M’Naghten test was correct. The King v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182, Stapleton v The Queen (1952) 86 CLR 358, R v Gomaa (Supreme Court of NSW, Badgery-Parker J, 27 April 1994, unreported) discussed. 
     
      
    b Intervention2 The content and extent of the questioning by his Honour did not lead to a miscarriage of justice. The express direction to the jury to disregard any opinion of the trial judge that the questioning may have revealed was, in the circumstances, adequate. 
     
      
    c Diminished Responsibility3 Irrespective of the conduct of a criminal trial on the part of the accused, there is an obligation on the court, in certain circumstances, to give directions to the jury to avoid a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    4 A finding of diminished responsibility was reasonably open on the evidence. Although it was not argued by the Appellant at trial, Newman J should have directed the jury in this regard. His Honour’s failure to do so constituted a miscarriage of justice. Pemble v The Queen (1971) 124 CLR 107, R v Ayoub [1984] 2 NSWLR 511 applied.d Unreasonable Verdict5 On the evidence before the jury, it was open for it to reject the defence of insanity.e Fresh Evidence6 The fresh evidence did not differ from the existing evidence to a material degree. There is no reason to conclude that if it were placed before a jury the jury would acquit or entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the Appellant. Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392, Mickleberg v The Queen (1988-1989) 167 CLR 259, R v Hemsley (Supreme Court of NSW, Court of Criminal Appeal, 8 December 1995, unreported), R v Ion (1996) 89 A Crim R 81 approved.

       REGINA v Stephen Darcy CHEATHAM 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
       
      SPIGELMAN CJ: 
       
      Introduction 
       
      
    1    In the late evening of 5 March, or in the early hours of 6 March, 1998, the Appellant formed the intention to kill his family. The Appellant’s case was that he believed that he was dying of AIDS, that he had infected his wife and children who, as a consequence, would also die. He said that he wrote letters to his mother and to his father-in-law and then took a knife from the kitchen and stabbed his sleeping wife, Sandra Cheatham, six times. He then went to the bedroom of his three year old daughter, Briahna, and stabbed her twenty times before wrapping her body in a towel and placing her on the bed next to his dead wife. He then went to the cot of his three month old daughter, Tahnee, and stabbed her twice in an unsuccessful attempt to kill her also. 
     
      
    2    The Appellant then made a 000 call reporting a “murder/suicide” at the family home at 25 Pacific Highway, Ourimbah. He stabbed himself a number of times and hit himself on the head with a hammer in an apparent attempt to commit suicide. He was located some time later hiding in a nearby garden shed, at which time he admitted to the two murders and the attempted murder. 
     
      
    3    His trial was conducted before Newman J and a jury. The only issue in the trial was the defence of insanity. A number of witnesses were called to give evidence about the Appellant’s conduct, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the killings. Two psychiatrists, Dr Milton and Dr Nielssen were called to give evidence for the Appellant in order to establish the defence of insanity. Dr Strum was called in reply by the Crown. 
     
      
    4    The jury returned with verdicts of guilty in respects of each count: two murders and one attempted murder. 
     
      
    5    Newman J imposed the following sentences: 
     
      
       
      (a) For the murder of Sandra Cheatham, a minimum term of 16 years and an additional term of 8 years; 
       
       
      (b) For the murder of Briahna Cheatham, a fixed term of 16 years; 
       
       
      (c) For the attempted murder of Tahnee Cheatham, a fixed term of 12 years. 
       
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    6    By an Amended Notice of Appeal, the Appellant appeals on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) His Honour failed to embark upon an adequate explanation of the criteria, which satisfies the second limb of the [M’Naghten] test, or to embark upon an adequate examination of its application to the special facts of this case. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Particulars 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) His Honour failed to draw the jury’s attention to the contest between the Crown and defence as to whether the Applicant was suffering from a ‘disease’ of the mind. 
           
           
          (ii) In the circumstances of this case, His Honours exposition of what was required by the defence to satisfy the ‘Second Limb’ of [M’Naghten] was inadequate and misleading. 
           
           
          (iii) His Honour failed to highlight that the wrongness being spoken of was of a ‘moral’ quality rather that of a ‘legal obligation’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) His Honour’s cross-examination of Dr. Milton in the circumstances of this case deprived the Applicant of a fair trial. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) His Honour, in the circumstances of this case, was obliged to leave to the jury the question of diminished responsibility. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) [This ground was withdrawn during submissions.] 
        
       
       
        
        (5) The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) In light of the new/fresh evidence, the verdict of guilty should be quashed.” 
        
       
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    7    Counsel for the Appellant advanced four propositions concerning the adequacy of his Honour’s directions to the jury: 
     
      
       
      (i) His Honour did not identify with sufficient specificity, those portions of the expert evidence which were to the effect that the Appellant suffered from a disease of the mind. 
       
       
      (ii) His Honour did not correctly direct the jury on the second limb of the M’Naghten test in that he stated the tested in too absolute terms. 
       
       
      (iii) His Honour erred by referring to an “ordinary reasonable person” standard. 
       
       
      (iv) His Honour should have said that the “wrongness” referred to in the test was of a “moral” quality, rather than a “legal” quality. 
       
      
    8    Newman J told the jury that punishing people for crimes that they commit both deters others from committing similar crimes and punishes the particular person for his or her wrongdoing. His Honour said that there would be little deterrent effect, and there would be little purpose in punishing somebody, if the person was obviously mentally ill at the time of the conduct which was alleged to constitute a criminal offence. His Honour then directed the jury as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is for those reasons that a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness is available. Your inquiry concerns a consideration of the evidence as it relates to the actual moments the alleged offences were committed. What you are looking to see is whether or not at that time the state of mind of the accused involved a defect of reason from disease of the mind. Mere excitability, lack of self control or impulsiveness are quite different things from a defect of reason due to disease of the mind. What you are concerned with here is a disorder of understanding and reasoning or a disorder of the functioning of the mind. 
        
       
       
        
        If you are satisfied that there was such a defect of reason from disease of the mind, then to constitute the defence it must be of such character as either - and these are alternatives, members of the jury, not conjunctives; that is, they are separate - either it prevented the accused from appreciating the nature and the quality of the act he was doing, or to prevent him knowing that what he was doing was wrong. 
        
       
       
        
        There are therefore two limbs, either of which is sufficient to establish the defence; that is, the accused did not appreciate the nature and quality of his act, or, if he did have that knowledge, that he did not know it was wrong.” 
        
       
      
    9    His Honour noted that no issue was raised at trial that the Appellant did not know the nature and quality of his act. The question for the jury to decide was whether the Appellant did not know that the acts he committed were wrong and that that lack of comprehension was due to a “disease of the mind”. His Honour said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is the second limb which has been raised in the accused’s defence. And as to that second limb, the question is whether by reason of the disease of the mind he was disabled from knowing that it was a wrong act to commit, that is the stabbing, in the sense that an ordinary, reasonable person understands right and wrong. I repeat that - in the sense that an ordinary, reasonable person understands right and wrong. That is, whether or not he was disabled from reasoning with a moderate degree of composure and sense as to the wrongness of what he was doing.” 
        
       
      
    10    The trial commenced on Monday 16 November 1998. Evidence concluded on the Thursday. Counsel addressed on the Friday. His Honour summed up on Monday 23 November 1998. The submission that his Honour did not adequately identify the evidence on “disease of the mind” must be understood in that context. The jury could not have been in any doubt that the Appellant’s experts had each identified such a disease. Counsel for the Appellant at the trial had summarised the evidence in his submissions on the Friday. He had said that Dr Milton was of the opinion that the Appellant had a hypochondriacal delusion which was a disease of the mind. Counsel had said that Dr Nielssen diagnosed the Appellant as suffering a melancholic depression of a severe kind which was a psychiatric illness and a disease of the mind. 
     
      
    11    The evidence to the effect that the Appellant was suffering a disease of the mind was before the jury with a degree of clarity that did not call for repetition by the trial judge. 
     
      
    12    The Appellant’s submissions with respect to the second limb focussed on his Honour’s choice of terminology. His Honour employed two formulations as to the requisite effect of as disease of the mind, if such existed: 
     
      
    · “it prevented the accused … knowing that what he was doing was wrong” 
     
      
    · he was disabled from knowing that it was a wrong act to commit … he was disabled from reasoning with a moderate degree of composure and sense as to the wrongness of what he was doing”. 
     
      
    13    The Appellant submitted that the words used - “prevented” and “disabled” - were too absolute. He submitted that the defence was not a “total absence of knowledge of wrongness”, but “difficulty with the reasoning process”. A mere “difficulty” with reasoning process is far too low a standard. Nevertheless, it is necessary to consider whether his Honour directed the jury to apply an inappropriate test. 
     
      
    14    The most commonly cited decision is that of Dixon J in The King v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182 where at 189, his Honour postulated the test in terms of whether: 
     
      
       
        
        “… his disease or disorder or disturbance of the mind was of such a character that he was unable to appreciate that the act he was doing was wrong. It is supposed that he knew he was killing, knew how he was killing and knew why he was killing, but that he was quite incapable of appreciating the wrongness of the act. … The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act ….” 
        
       
      
    15    His Honour repeated the test in terms of “incapable of” and “quite incapable of” later in this same passage. 
     
      
    16    The joint judgment of the Court in Stapleton v The Queen (1952) 86 CLR 358 at 367 also employed the formulation “incapable of reasoning”. I note that in a careful review of the authorities in R v Gomaa (Supreme Court of NSW, Badgery-Parker J, 27 April 1994, unreported), Badgery-Parker J at 29 referred to “incapacity”. 
     
      
    17    These three formulations of Dixon J which I have quoted - “unable to appreciate”, “quite incapable of appreciating” and “able to appreciate” - as well as the subsequent formulation, “incapable”, in Stapleton, appear to me to have the same degree of “absoluteness”, to use the phrase of counsel for the Appellant, as the formulations employed by his Honour - “prevented” and “disabled”. I would reject this submission. 
     
      
    18    The third submission under this heading referred to his Honour’s use of the phrase “ordinary reasonable person” in the passage quoted above with respect to knowledge of right and wrong. It was submitted that the introduction of the word “reasonable” may have invoked an inappropriate standard. I do not accept that this is the case. Indeed in Porter itself the two words were used interchangeably in the following passage at 190: 
     
      
       
        
        “What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the standards of  
        reasonable 
         people. If you think that at the time when he administered the poison to the child he had such a mental disorder or disturbance or derangement that he was incapable of reasoning about the right or wrongness, according to  
        ordinary 
         standards … .” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    19    The fourth submission was that his Honour failed to state that the “wrongness” being spoken of was “moral wrongness”, not “legal wrongness”. The occasion for drawing this distinction was said to arise from the circumstance that Dr Nielssen gave evidence that the Appellant may have known that his actions were against the law but that he did not know they were morally wrong. This led the Crown to submit in its address: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I suggest it is not a very far jump at all to get from a belief that something was illegal to a belief or a knowledge that it was wrong and morally wrong. 
        
       
       
        
        The distinction between illegal and morally wrong, I suggest to you, is a very fine distinction indeed.” 
        
       
      
    20    Nothing in the circumstances of the trial suggest any likelihood that the jury would have applied a test of “wrong at law”. Counsel appearing for the Appellant did not request an express direction, even though the distinction was the subject of legal submissions before his Honour. In my opinion, the jury was not left with any uncertainty as to the nature of the wrong it had to consider. The failure of his Honour to draw the distinction contended for did not lead to a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    21    Ground 1 should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    22    This ground is based on a series of questions which his Honour directed to Dr Milton. The Appellant submitted that this questioning by his Honour demonstrated to the jury that his Honour was taking an adverse view of the doctor’s evidence. In particular, counsel for the Appellant said that the effect, from the jury’s point of view, was that his Honour said four times that the answers of the Appellant after the killing were consistent with the Appellant knowing that what he was doing was wrong. Reference was made to the following questions by Newman J. 
     
      
    23    His Honour first asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q But doctor, you say the police officer was outraged. Why do you make that comment? 
         
        A Because I think it is a natural thing to be if you find a mother and a child dead and you are going to be outraged with the person that has done it, and you may well challenge them in some fashion and say, ‘No, it is not your right to do that’. 
         
         
        Q The police officer has a duty to make inquiries; does not do it out of outrage, doctor? 
         
        A He is still a human being, and that is a very difficult situation for anybody, your Honour.”  
        
       
      
    24    Subsequently his Honour asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Doctor, why did you transpose the answer? What was recorded in evidence was, ‘I have something wrong, I have killed my family and I have got AIDS’. Why did you transpose, put the AIDS first and the killing the family second? 
         
        A I haven’t got the statement before me, your Honour. I have been going from the evidence. There are so many bundles here, I didn’t bring them up with me.” 
        
       
      
    25    Finally, in the passage primarily relied upon, his Honour asked the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Just to clear up a couple of things up in my own mind, doctor. As I understand it your diagnosis is that the accused at the time when these events occurred was suffering from a hypochondriacal delusion? 
         
        A Yes. 
         
         
        Q As I understand it you say that that hypochondriacal delusion was such that at the time of the commission of the act he could not distinguish right from wrong and in fact not only did he not believe what he was doing was wrong, but in fact had a belief what he was doing was right? 
         
        A Yes. 
         
         
        Q Am I quite correctly stating your view? 
         
        A Yes your Honour. 
         
         
        Q Is it possible that a person could be suffering from a hypochondriacal delusion of the very type that this man was suffering from, which I understand to be that he was suffering from AIDS and that somehow he had transmitted that condition to his wife and children. That is the delusion, is it not? 
         
        A That is the delusion. 
         
         
        Q That is the delusion? 
         
        A Yes. 
         
         
        Q And at the same time of suffering from that delusion can distinguish right from wrong in committing the act? 
         
        A It is certainly possible. 
         
         
        Q I mean the delusion itself does not completely inhibit he ability of a human being to distinguish between right and wrong? 
         
        A Not necessarily. 
         
         
        Q Making the assumption that he was suffering from hypochondriacal delusion, is it relevant to the consideration of whether or not he knew what he was doing was right or wrong in terms of the way you thought it was right rather than wrong? 
         
        A Yes. 
         
         
        Q Did you take consideration of the statements he made immediately after the event? 
         
        A Yes, I think all the statements are important, your Honour, and I have attempted to take notice of them all as a whole. 
         
         
        Q All right. Assume to an ambulance officer by the name of Mr Vince, when Mr Vince was trying to treat him after he was found, and he and the other ambulance officer, a fellow called Ferguson, were trying to put an oxygen mask over his nose and the accused said, ‘I don’t want it, I don’t deserve it, and I can refuse it if I want’; the fact he made the statement ‘I can refuse it if I want’ is a valid statement as legally right, is it not? 
         
        A I suppose it is in keeping with today’s conditions, that people talk about such things. 
         
         
        Q You can assume Mr Vince then said, ‘Come on mate, just let us do our job’ to which the accused replied, ‘No, I don’t deserve it’. Then Vince said, ‘Why?’ and the answer was, ‘I have just wiped out my whole family’. Now, is that answer consistent with the accused being aware of what he had just done was wrong? 
         
        A I think it is consistent with him not wanting to live because he felt he was such a dreadful person for what he had done. I think that is true, I think that must be taken in the context of the delusion as I have hypothesised as a whole. 
         
         
        Q But it is consistent with him being aware of the distinction between right and wrong at the time, is it not? 
         
        A Yes. 
         
         
        Q The other ambulance officer, Mr Ferguson, says that he had this conversation with him, having found out his name, ‘Just lift your arm up so we can clean your injuries’. The response given, ‘I don’t want treatment as I have just stabbed my family’. Then Mr Ferguson says - and there was no challenge as to this - ‘We will get these wounds cleaned up’, and his response was, ‘I just killed my wife and daughters’. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Again, is that response consistent with the accused being aware of the distinction between right and wrong at the time he committed the offence? 
          
         
        A It is, your Honour. I think you have to see it in the context of him wanting to die, as a genuine statement of wanting to die and regarding himself as a person without right or value to live. 
         
         
        Q You have already been asked about what he said to Superintendent Moore, ‘I have done something wrong, I have killed by family and I have got AIDS’. Again, is that consistent with him being aware that he was aware of the distinction between right and wrong? 
         
        A It is the awareness of him being a terrible person, as he saw himself. Was that because he had just killed them, in some ways yes, because he said so, or is it a pattern that had been happening over some weeks, yes, that applies.” 
        
       
      
    26    In the course of both his opening remarks to the jury and in his summing up, his Honour indicated that the jury should disregard any views it may think he expressed during the course of the trial. He emphasised that all matters of fact were for the jury alone. The Appellant submitted that these comments did not cure the injustice perpetrated by the questioning. 
     
      
    27    At the trial, there was no objection to his Honour’s questions. Nor was there an application for a discharge. Nor was there any request for a redirection. 
     
      
    28    It is well established that intervention by the trial judge may deprive an accused of a fair trial. However, that requires a degree of intervention of a different order from that set out above. (See eg. R v Clever (1953) 37 Cr App R 37; R v Wilson (Supreme Court of NSW, Court of Criminal Appeal, 7 March 1995, unreported); Galea v Galea (1990) 19 NSWLR 263). On the other hand it is appropriate for a judge to seek to elucidate the evidence. (See eg. Yuill v Yuill [1945] 1 All ER 183 at 185-186; GIO (NSW) v Glasscock (1991) 13 MVR 521 at 529). 
     
      
    29    The questions to which objection is taken in this case did identify an aspect of the evidence in a way which was unfavourable to the defence case. In doing so the jury may have formed a view as to the judge’s own opinion. His Honour did go beyond merely clarifying the evidence. The line of questioning would best have been left to cross-examination by the Crown. I note that the last, longest and most pertinent passage of questioning by his Honour occurred at the end of the Crown’s cross-examination, although it is not entirely clear from the transcript that the Crown had in fact concluded before his Honour asked the series of questions. 
     
      
    30    Neither the extent nor the content of his Honour’s questions, in my opinion, warrant intervention by this Court. I do not accept that the Appellant was deprived of a fair trial. Insofar as the questioning revealed his Honour’s own opinion, the express direction to the jury to disregard any such opinion was, in the circumstances, adequate. Insofar as his Honour elicited additional evidence, it was pertinent and in a narrow compass and was not of a character, either in extent or content, to constitute a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    31    The Appellant submitted that his Honour was obliged to direct the jury on diminished responsibility and leave the option of a finding of manslaughter to the jury. 
     
      
    32    Although not the subject of submissions, it appears that the form of s23A before the coming into effect of the Crimes Amendment (Diminished Responsibility) Act 1997, on 3 April 1998, was applicable to the Appellant. It is not necessary to decide this point as nothing turns on the distinction for present purposes. 
     
      
    33    It was Newman J who raised the issue with trial counsel for the Appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Indeed, in the back of my mind during the evidence of the psychiatrists I was considering whether or not I should put diminished responsibility. But the psychiatrists did not seem to go into that area at all. 
        
       
       
        
        HEALEY: No, that is not our case. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Plainly enough you agree with me, it is not a case in which I can put diminished responsibility”.  
        
       
      
    34    No explanation was provided to this Court on the reason why diminished responsibility was not pursued at the trial. No evidence was adduced in this Court, as is often done, to explain the decision not to pursue such a case. 
     
      
    35    The submissions to this Court did not attempt to bring this case within the limited circumstances in which the conduct of a trial can lead to appellable error. (See R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 683-685 per Gleeson CJ.) 
     
      
    36    Irrespective of the conduct of a criminal trial on the part of the accused, there is an obligation on the court, in certain circumstances, to give directions to the jury to avoid a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    37    This issue arose in a relevantly analogous way in Pemble v The Queen (1971) 124 CLR 107 in the context of a provocation defence to murder. In that case, Barwick CJ said at 117-118: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whatever course counsel may see fit to take, no doubt bona fide but for tactical reasons in what he considers the best interest of his client, the trial judge must be astute to secure for the accused a fair trial according to law. This involves, in my opinion, an adequate direction both as to the law and the possible use of the relevant facts upon any matter upon which the jury could in the circumstances of the case upon the material before them find or base a verdict in whole or in part. 
        
       
       
        
        In  
        Mancini v Director of Public Prosecutions 
         [1942] AC 1, provocation was not relied upon by defending counsel. In  
        Kwaku Mensah v The King 
         [1946] AC 83, the provocation was not raised at the trial nor in the reasons in the Appellant’s case for the consideration of the Privy Council. But, there being material before the jury on which they could properly have found provocation so as to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter, their Lordships considered the absence of any direction as to provocation when that matter was raised by counsel in argument before them for the first time; and for lack of appropriate direction set aside a conviction for murder. 
        
       
       
        
        Here, counsel for the defence did not merely not rely on the matters now sort to be raised; he abandoned them and expressly confined the defence to the matters he did raise. However, in my opinion, this course did not relieve the trial judge of the duty to put to the jury with adequate assistance any matters on which the jury, upon the evidence, could find for the accused.” (See also at 133 per Menzies J) 
        
       
      
    38    Section 405B of the Crimes Act 1900 as in force at the time of the trial (now relocated to s49 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986), provided that an accused person must not, without the leave of the Court, adduce evidence tending to prove a contention of substantial mental impairment, unless the accused gives notice of an intention to do so. In the proceedings before this Court, the Crown did not rely on the absence of notice. 
     
      
    39    Perhaps the considerations referred to in Pemble, which require a direction on the part of a trial judge, can be applied to formulate a requirement to give leave under s49 in circumstances of the character now before the Court. In any event, the statutory prohibition in s49 does not prevent reliance on s23A. It forbids the adducing of evidence tending to prove such a contention. That evidence was, according to the Appellant’s submissions in this Court, adduced in any event in the course of establishing a defence of mental illness. As s49 was not relied upon by the Crown, it is not necessary to express a final view on this matter. 
     
      
    40    I am not aware of any case in which the reasoning in Pemble has been applied to a defence of diminished responsibility. It has, however, been referred to in the context of the defence of mental illness in R v Ayoub [1984] 2 NSWLR 511 where Street CJ said at 515: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is, of course, clear that, if the state of the evidence justifies it, a trial judge will put to the jury the defence of mental illness of his own motion.  
        R v Damic 
         [1982] 2 NSWLR 750 is a recent instance of such a case. Moreover, irrespective of whether or not the accused raises or disclaims such a defence, a trial judge, if he sees it as fairly open, may well have a positive duty to put the defence himself:  
        Pemble v The Queen 
         (1971) 124 CLR 107."" 
        
       
      
    41    The issue is whether or not the defence of diminished responsibility was reasonably open on the evidence before the Court. 
     
      
    42    The Appellant’s submissions were based on the proposition that the Appellant has lost the opportunity of a conviction for manslaughter. Plainly, significant differences exist between the M’Naghten test and the statutory provision for diminished responsibility. In particular, the elements of incapacity to control himself did not arise explicitly on the mental illness defence. Furthermore, a test of “substantial impairment” is less stringent. 
     
      
    43    The factual basis for the Appellant’s submission that a proper basis for a diminished responsibility finding under s23A of the Crimes Act 1900 had been established consisted of certain statements made to police and ambulance officers on the night, the contents of an electronically recorded interview with police and his own statements made to the psychiatric witnesses, together with the expert opinions. In the record of interview, the Appellant said on several occasions “I just lost control of myself”. Reliance was also placed on his suicidal conduct. The Appellant stabbed himself several times on the night of the killings. He also wrote two letters, which counsel for the Appellant described as suicide notes. 
     
      
    44    The Appellant’s explanation for his conduct was set out in the two letters he wrote on the fatal evening, purportedly before the killings. 
     
      
    45    The Appellant’s letter to his mother was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have given my beautiful wife and my darling daughters an incurable disease which cannot be cured. I am (the word ‘dying’ and the word ‘a’ is crossed out) more advanced in the disease than what my darling girls are, so it would be impossible to care for them when they went into the advanced stages of this disease. Sandy doesn’t no (sic) I have this disease, but she is complaining of the same symptoms. Sandy and my beautiful daughters are now sleeping in bed, so she is not aware of what I am going to do. I deserve to go to hell for what I have done to my beautiful girls, and I more than likely will. Sandy and my beautiful daughters will no doubt go to a better place, where there is no disease, into the arms of her mother and the girls’ beautiful grandmother. You have been my guiding light throughout my life and I love you dearly. Please continue to let that light shine for the rest of the family. Your loving son, Stephen.” 
        
       
      
    46    The Appellant’s letter to his father-in-law was: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have given my beautiful wife and your adorning (sic) daughter and grandaughters an incurable infectious disease. I found out last week that I only had a short time to live from this disease Sandy had been complaining of some of the symptoms that I have already been through your beautiful daughter and grandaughters are now sleeping soundly so my beautiful wife is not aware of what is going to happen. Sandy and the children will be joining Beryl in Heaven and I will no doubt go where I belong Hell. Ian I love my wife and daughters just as much as any other man but I will not be able to care for them when they get sick this disease is extremely ostracised in the community and there is no known cure or will be in the forseeable future. I don’t no (sic) of any more to say but I no (sic) Beryl will be calling for them in Heaven. I am so sorry that I have done this to your beautiful daughter and grandaughters. May only the Lord find it in his heart to forgive me. 
         
         Stephen 
         
          
          I have betrayed my family like no other man can.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    47    The Appellant also asserted that he believed he had AIDS and had infected his family in statements made to ambulance and police officers in the immediate aftermath of the killings. He made similar statements to the two psychiatrists called in his case. 
     
      
    48    The first expert called by the Appellant at the trial was Dr Milton. In examination-in-chief, Dr Milton gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Did you ask him questions as to whether or not he was suffering from any other forms of established mental illnesses? 
         
         A I asked questions directed towards that, and there was no indication of any other mental illness. I think the weight loss perhaps could indicate some preceding depression, but nothing else of note. 
        
       
       
        
         Q He was able to concentrate on your questions and provide you with answers? 
         
         A Yeah, he was reasonable, taking into account the circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
         Q Are you able to say anything about the thought disorder during the time that you were speaking to him? 
         
         A No, his thoughts were properly ordered, not disorganised. They were arranged properly with the subject and the verb and the object in the sentence, and properly set out, that kind of thing. 
        
       
       
        
         Q Did you also receive some additional material from his brother David about obsessional tendencies that the accused exhibited as a child? 
         
         A Yes, Stephen had these obsessional habits, which are not an uncommon thing, but it evidently happened to a degree as to any of his others. He’d touch things in a ritual sort of way, and he jiggled his legs and generally acted in such a way as to suggest he was of an obsessional and perhaps basically very anxious nature. 
        
       
       
        
         Q Doctor, did you form some opinions in respect of this man on 8 March of this year? 
         
         A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
         Q Are you able to refer to those in terms of whether he was suicidal? 
         
         A Yeah, that is the first thing I was concerned about, and I thought all the information that I had had, and all my observations in the interview, suggested he was actively suicidal and had been at the time of or immediately after the deaths. I have noted here he layed quietly most of the time, but I got the impression that he could suddenly become impulsively self-destructive, like getting up, tearing out his drips, running out of the hospital, jumping off a balcony or doing something like that.” 
        
       
      
    49    Dr Milton then gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Now doctor, were you able then to form an opinion in respect of the acts that were carried out by this man on the night of 5 March 1998? 
         
         A Yes I was. 
        
       
       
        
         Q And what was that opinion? 
         
         A Well, I considered that four months earlier he had formed a belief he was suffering from AIDS and that some how he had the notion that he had got this by heterosexual intercourse before his marriage; that he felt devastated at believing he has AIDS - had AIDS - but by the same token, couldn’t bring himself to seek help. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I concluded that he felt intensely troubled and I noted a loss of appetite, loss of weight, trouble concentrating. There were some minor sleep difficulties. He said that he took three jobs in order to distract himself from his worries, although his brother thought he did that extra work because he had some financial problems from being too keen on gambling. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         Now, about a month before the deaths he perceived at least what he thought was signs of the infection in his wife and two young daughters, and in his view he had effectively murdered them by giving them the disease. But I don’t think at that time he’d formed any notion of harming them. 
        
       
       
        
         I have referred again to him taking a day off work on the Thursday 5 March and to the shopping trip, and then during the day seeing his daughters coughing, and I have referred to him writing a letter to father-in-law and his mother. And then I have mentioned the facts as recounted to me about the deaths themselves. And then, when being found by the police, calling out to them not to approach because he had AIDS. 
        
       
       
        
         I concluded that he intentionally killed his wife and daughter and he wounded one other daughter and he did so as a result of a delusion. The delusion was that he had AIDS and he had infected them with it, and in consequences they were going to die as a result of his improper actions. 
        
       
       
        
         The type of delusion is described as a hypochondriacal one, if one wants to apply a term to it, and that is quite consistent with his brother’s account of him always having a very strange pre-occupation with his physical health and having had strange beliefs about the significance of any symptoms he had and whether he had serious diseases and whether he might die from them. It is also consistent with a family history of the same problem. 
        
       
       
        
         I concluded that he knew what he was doing, but because of the delusion he was unable to reason with an even moderate degree of composure about what he was doing was wrong. I believe that when he committed the acts leading to the deaths and the wounding he mistakenly thought he was doing right, that is, of course, to save the family suffering from something he thought would be a terrible end. 
        
       
       
        
         Q Now doctor, have you had any experience of a similar kind in your professional career? 
         
         A Yes I have. It is not common for a person who is a hypochondriac to actually to get a delusion, that is an actual belief, they have the disease, or a disease. But I have seen one other person who had a belief that he suffered AIDS, and this followed after being bitten by another person. And this man’s behaviour reached the level of delusion. He was unable to work for many months and he subjected his family to all sorts of unusual examinations each evening to check the progress of what he thought was a disease that they may have got from him. I was much impressed at the parallels between the two cases.” 
        
       
      
    50    Later in evidence Dr Milton said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q You are aware of the placing of the child Briahna beside the mother? 
         
         A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
         Q What do you say about that? 
         
         A That is a measure of concern the accused had for the dead child and of his affection for her. 
        
       
       
        
         Q In conjunction with the number of stab wounds to Briahna and the placement of the body, are you able to say something about that in your opinion? 
         
         A I think there was a determination to kill her and once having done so he wanted to put her body somewhere where it would be near the mother, in essence a kind of loving gesture as far as one can apply that.” 
        
       
      
    51    In Dr Milton’s view, the number of stab wounds was evidence of a “determination to kill”. This was in response to questions directed to a report written by the Crown’s expert, Dr Strum which said that the number of stab wounds was evidence of something else, for example, anger. 
     
      
    52    In cross-examination, the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Did you say earlier in your evidence he was not psychotic? 
         
         A No, I can’t recollect. I think he was psychotic, he qualifies for delusional disorder, which is a psychosis. I think I said he didn’t show obvious signs of psychosis, when you think of schizophrenia, people who are floridly insane. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         Q What you are saying is that in doing what he did he didn’t know that it was wrong; is that what your evidence is? 
         
         A Well, even further, that he thought he was doing right by saving them from a death that was of a particularly horrible kind. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         Q During the course of that evening he rang triple 0 and reported a murder/suicide. Don’t you think that that of itself is some indication that he knew that what he had done was wrong? 
         
         A Well, I suppose, murder being intrinsically wrong, I suppose he knew that. But I think you can do the right thing in the sense of notifying the authorities, and I think he could quite easily have done that while still maintaining the delusion that what he had done was because he had AIDS and had infected the family.” 
        
       
      
    53    Later in cross-examination Dr Milton said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A … The whole thing comes from a feeling of guilt, and it was from guilt that he killed them. But I think that he killed them to save them, rather than because he hated them or for some other reason.” 
        
       
      
    54    Earlier, the following question had been asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Just on this question of murder, he used that expression a number of times during the course of the interview that he had with the police, and he made it - well, I will ask you this: In relation to the suggestion that he murdered his family, I think at one stage he indicated that he murdered them some time ago by giving them the AIDS virus? 
         
         A Yes, he had said that. 
        
       
       
        
         Q Now in saying that, isn’t that an acknowledgment by him that he had some capacity at that time to distinguish between right and wrong when he used the word, ‘murdering’ them? 
         
         A I think his whole thinking was in terms of himself having done wrong by infecting them. I think what he sought to do was to at least repair some of the damage he had done, in this very crazy way of taking their lives.” 
        
       
      
    55    Towards the end of cross-examination Dr Milton said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q It is possible, isn’t it, or do you acknowledge that it is possible, that he is not telling the truth at all about his belief? 
         
         A Well, I think it is possible. It certainly didn’t fit with my impression of him, but it is always possible.” 
        
       
      
    56    After that Dr Milton was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Mr Wilson, who was a colleague, a work colleague of the accused, spoke with the accused on the evening of these events at around about 8 or 8.30 in the evening, and during the course of the conversation that he had with the accused he said that the accused at one point was extremely happy with some news that had been passed on to him. 
        
       
       
        
         Mr Wilson also expressed the view that the accused appeared to be in good spirits when he rang him at that time of the evening. What I am suggesting, doctor, is that there is a possibility, is there not, that after that phone call something happened that led the accused to take his wife’s life and the life of his daughter and stab the third, which may not necessarily be associated with any belief that he held as to whether or not he had AIDS? 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [A] Yes, it is possible, and I’d be happy to consider any suggested possibilities that might have caused him to do that.” 
        
       
      
    57    In relation to the letter, Dr Milton was cross-examined as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q He wrote as well, didn’t he, that because he had done that he was going to go to hell and they were going to go to heaven. Doesn’t that as well indicate that he had the capacity at least to reason between right and wrong when he wrote those letters? 
         
         A Well --  
        
       
       
        
         Q Given the fact - I’m sorry to interrupt you - but he is saying, is he not, that he is going to hell because he has done the wrong thing by them, giving them the disease, and he is going to hell because of having done that? 
         
         A I think that could be suggested. The whole thing comes from a feeling of guilt, and it was from guilt that he killed them. But I think that he killed them to save them, rather than because he hated them or for some other reason.” 
        
       
      
    58    Dr Nielssen was the second of the experts called by the Appellant. He gave evidence-in-chief as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q What did you think then as far as his state of mind was concerned? 
         
         A Because of the state of mind, which I have diagnosed as a severe depressive illness with a delusional belief, he seized upon that comment and became convinced he was about to die of AIDS.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         Q Did he indicate anything to you about hypochondriacal illnesses or anything of that kind? 
         
         A Yes, he said he had always been very anxious about his health and during childhood and adolescence he felt concerned if he cut himself he would bleed to death, and he remembered lying in bed and hoping he would not have leukemia or some such illness. I elicited a history about his earlier health. 
        
       
       
        
         Q Did you form a view he may have been deceiving you in his presentation at the time? 
         
         A That was certainly a question that was put to the case conference where Mr Cheatham was presented on 19 March this year, and perhaps it was one of the reasons why Dr Corcos presented him to the meeting. But it was both my view, and I had the opportunity to interview him and test his delusional beliefs, and also I think the unanimous view of psychiatrists present he was not fabricating his symptoms. 
        
       
       
        
         Q Did you form a view in respect of this man, so far as it related to his actions on the night of 5 March 1998? 
         
         A Yes, well I diagnosed him as suffering from melancholic depression. 
        
       
       
        
         Q What does that mean in simple terms? 
         
         A It is a very severe form of depression where one is more susceptible to developing depressive delusions. 
        
       
       
        
         Q What is a depression as such, what do you mean by that? 
         
         A I think depression is an illness where the sufferer is conscious, they have a capacity to be aware of their feelings, of severe unhappiness and sadness. Also, they have a morbid view on themselves, their future and their surroundings. 
        
       
       
        
         Q Taking that in conjunction with the word ‘melancholic’, could you explain that? 
         
         A Melancholic features are a biological feature, interrupted sleep, loss of appetite, loss of weight, loss of energy, and also of feelings of great guilt or something terrible about to happen or having happened. Also a generally more severe syndrome of depression. 
        
       
       
        
         Q Do you know whether this man was suffering any of those symptoms? 
         
         A Yes, I think he suffered from all of them, to a greater or lesser extent. He certainly reported the physical symptoms of severe depression that he formed, a significant weight loss, interrupted sleep and lack of energy. I believe the delusional belief that he developed was a mid congruent depressive delusion. 
        
       
       
        
         Q Can you just explain that in simple terms? 
         
         A He was depressed and hence the delusion he had, that he had a terminal illness, was consistent with that depressed mood. 
        
       
       
        
         Q That applied to himself, the delusion applied to himself in terms of his own infection. Was there a significant delusion? 
         
         A Yes, I think it expanded to include the belief regarding his wife and children. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         Q In your discussions with him what did you believe yourself that he was trying to indicate to you as to the deaths, what was he saying to you? 
         
         A His explanation that killing his wife and children was to save them from the consequences both of his own death, which would have been that other people would have known that he died of AIDS and realised also they had AIDS. Also from the suffering they would experience when they inevitably became terminally ill. 
        
       
       
        
         Q Was there a combination of factors that applied to his states of depression? 
         
         A Yes, I thought he had his pre-morbid personality mood and was vulnerable to depression, and also to developing this particular depressive delusion, and in this case I agree with Dr Milton, he had a hypochondriacal tendency. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         Q Do you say that was a characteristic of his personality? 
         
         A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
         Q That goes hand and glove with the elexithymic function? 
         
         A When he was depressed, when he was younger he did not seek any help so that goes hand in hand with that. 
        
       
       
        
         Q Drawing attention to those features you have explained to the jury, what is your opinion as to the state of mind of the accused at the time when he took the life of his wife and his child and wounded his daughter on the night of 5 March this year? 
         
         A I believe severely mentally ill, and had a psychotic illness, and that is to say he had lost touch with reality and he had the fixed false belief he was going to die from AIDS, and also his family would. 
        
       
       
        
         Q Is that a disease of the mind? 
         
         A Yes, I think that is well recognised as a disease of the mind in the legal sense. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         Q Did Mr Cheatham understand the nature of the quality of his acts? 
         
         A Yes, I think that is fairly clear in the evidence of what he did do, that he clearly understood that he was stabbing his wife and children. 
        
       
       
        
         Q Are you able to say whether or not he realised his actions were wrong? 
         
         A I believe that he was capable of seeing that his actions were wrong in the sense that they were against the law, but I believe in his delusional state he did not know his actions were morally wrong as he believed he was saving his wife and children from a worse fate.” 
        
       
      
    59    In cross-examination of Dr Nielssen, the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q He obviously accepted, when he used the word ‘murder’ in the context of passing on this virus, he obviously accepted that he had done the wrong thing because he said he would go to hell for doing it. Later in the interview when shown the knife he said that was the knife that he used to murder his wife and daughter. 
         
          
         
          
          What I am asking you, isn’t feasible that, in using the word ‘murder’ on that occasion, that he knew that what he did was wrong in a moral sense; not only just in the legal sense, but in a moral sense? 
          
         
         A Yes, well, I think you have pointed out what I would argue that he believed he had already killed them through causing them to become infected with HIV. And again, I don’t believe that he set out to do that in advance, or actually believe that at the time he got married. I think he developed that delusional belief relatively recently out of a hypochondriacal concern. But I think that the time that he thought that he had killed them was prior to actually causing, if you like, their immediate deaths by stabbing them. 
         
         
         As to the use of the term ‘murder’, I mean, I think that I would interpret that to be in the colloquial sense, and bearing in mind too that he was severely depressed, and a characteristic of severe depression is pathological guilt. So I could understand him painting himself in the worst possible light.” 
        
       
      
    60    Dr Milton was of the view that the only difference between his own approach to the condition of the Appellant and that of Dr Nielssen was that they were looking at the same thing “from different angles and therefore [giving] it slightly different names.” 
     
      
    61    In the context of Ground 5, I will set out my reasons for holding that it was open to the jury to reject the Appellant’s mental illness defence. Some of those reasons may also apply to a defence of diminished responsibility. This Court cannot know which of the various bases for the jury’s decision caused the jury to reach its conclusion. 
     
      
    62    In many, if not most cases, a defence of mental illness will result in a body of evidence being adduced which would support a finding of substantial impairment under s23A. This was the case here. The evidence of Dr Milton and Dr Nielssen would, if accepted by the jury, establish the basis of a finding of this character even though, as I indicate below, the jury did not accept the proposition that the Appellant was unable to distinguish right from wrong. 
     
      
    63    It is unnecessary to consider the range of alternative routes to a substantial impairment finding which would be consistent with the jury’s rejection of the mental illness defence. A finding of diminished responsibility was, in my opinion, reasonably open on the evidence. As in Pemble the Appellant has lost the opportunity of having his crime reduced from murder too manslaughter. In my opinion, the loss of this opportunity constitutes a miscarriage of justice. I would allow the appeal on this ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5 
       
      
    64    Ground 5 was not abandoned, but only faintly pressed. These were a number of alternative bases on which the jury was entitled to reach the conclusion it reached. 
     
      
    65    It was submitted that the evidence of Dr Milton and Dr Nielssen should have been accepted and in the light of their evidence the verdict could not be supported. Dr Strum was a psychiatrist called by the Crown. He gave evidence to the contrary of the Appellant’s experts. It was open to the jury to accept that evidence. 
     
      
    66    Alternatively, it was open to the jury to reject in its entirety the Appellant’s case that he had a belief that he had AIDS, that he had infected his family and that he killed them and attempted suicide for that reason. 
     
      
    67    The jury had before it evidence from a work colleague of the Appellant’s, who was probably the last person to speak to him before the killings on the fatal evening. He testified that the Appellant appeared to be in good spirits and that they spoke for up to 45 minutes about work tasks for the following day and the roster for the following week. With respect to a particular development at work, the Appellant’s response was described as “extremely happy”. 
     
      
    68    It was also open to the jury to take into account two other features of the events as inconsistent with the Appellant’s case. 
     
      
    69    First, the nature of the attacks, particularly on the deceased daughter - twenty stab wounds were inflicted on her - indicating a ferocity that was not suggestive of a mercy killing. 
     
      
    70    Secondly, the jury may well have concluded that anyone capable of so ferocious an attack on his family would not have failed in an attempt at suicide, if that is what he wanted to do. 
     
      
    71    No doubt each of these aspects of the evidence could be construed as consistent with a mental disturbance of the requisite character. Each could also be construed as inconsistent with the Appellant’s case about his motivations for the killings. The choice was for the jury. 
     
      
    72    The only evidence about the factual substratum of the Appellant’s case was self-serving: two letters written on the night - purportedly before the events - the statements to police and ambulance officers after his apprehension and, subsequently, statements to the psychiatrists. There was no evidence of any concern by the Appellant about AIDS prior to the night. There was no evidence of any medical consultations or of any tests. There was no indication of any expression of concern by the Appellant to any person. There was no evidence of distraught conduct on his part prior to the fatal night. 
     
      
    73    It was open to the jury to reject the factual substratum of the Appellant’s case, on which the expert opinions were based. 
     
      
    74    Furthermore, the jury had before it other evidence on which it could rely to draw the conclusion, contrary to the Appellant’s experts, that the Appellant knew that what he had done was wrong. 
     
      
    75    First, in the call he made to 000, he used the expression “murder/suicide”. The word “murder” carries a connotation of wrongful killing, not merely illegal but wrongful. 
     
      
    76    Secondly, when the ambulance officers sought to treat him after the killings, he said to them “I don’t deserve it” and “I don’t want treatment as I have just stabbed my family”. These statements also suggest that he knew he had done something wrong. 
     
      
    77    Thirdly, Superintendent Moore, together with a dog handler, was the first to approach the Appellant at the shed where he was hiding. He gave evidence that the Appellant said to him, in the immediate aftermath of the killings, “I have done something wrong. I have killed my family and have got AIDS.” 
     
      
    78    Fourthly, immediately before the killings, the Appellant wrote the two letters I have set out above. The contents are not entirely clear but they do suggest a capacity to distinguish right from wrong. 
     
      
    79    Counsel for the Appellant described these two letters as suicide notes. He submitted that the references to “going to hell” did not indicate that the Appellant knew the difference between right and wrong, because of the use of the past tense in the letter to his mother i.e. “I deserve to go to hell for what I have done to my beautiful girls”. The past tense, it was submitted, was a reference to the belief that he had infected his daughters with AIDS, not a reference to the intended killings. 
     
      
    80    The first thing to say about this submission is that the equivalent reference in the letter to his father-in-law does not employ the past tense. He said “I will no doubt go where I belong Hell”. 
     
      
    81    The second point arises from the last three sentences in the letter to the father-in-law: 
     
      
       
        
        “… but I no (sic) Beryl will be calling for them in Heaven. I am sorry that I have done this to your beautiful daughter and grandaughters. May only the Lord find it in his heart to forgive me”. 
        
       
      
    82    The first of these sentences suggest he was referring to the deaths of his family when, in the second sentence, he used the past tense. The third sentence reinforces an inference that he knew what he was doing was wrong. 
     
      
    83    Finally, even on the submissions of Counsel for the Appellant, his client was able to distinguish right from wrong with respect to the act of infecting another person with a disease. Even if the references to “Hell” were references to this fact, the jury were entitled to infer that a person who could distinguish right from wrong in this regard was likely to also be able to do so with respect to killing. 
     
      
    84    In my opinion, it was open to the jury to reject the defence of insanity. 
     
      
       
      Ground 6 
       
      
    85    The Appellant submitted that, on the basis of fresh evidence, this Court should quash the conviction. The formulation of the appropriate test has been variously expressed: “A significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably would have acquitted” and “a jury might entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt”. (See Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 399, 402, 421; Mickleberg v The Queen (1988-1989) 167 CLR 259 at 275, 301-302; R v Hemsley (Supreme Court of NSW, Court of Criminal Appeal, 8 December 1995, unreported) at 4-6 per Hunt CJ at CL). For present purposes, no relevant difference appears to arise from these varying formulations. 
     
      
    86    The additional evidence comprised two psychiatric reports by Dr Yolanda Lucire and Dr Karl Koller. Dr Lucire expressed the opinion: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Cheatham was suffering from a disease of the mind. Specifically this was a major depression with delusions. 
        
       
       
        
        His delusional belief that he was infected with AIDS and that he had infected his family with AIDS. This was not just a hypochondriacal notion. It was highly emotionally charged, as are delusions, and in fact it was the driving force for his ultimate homicide”. 
        
       
      
    87    She went on to explain that the killings were “driven by delusional belief” which made them “not morally wrong but morally the correct thing to do, the merciful thing to do …”. 
     
      
    88    In a further report she said that the Appellant “… was suffering from the most heavy, severe depression that I have seen for a long time”. She concluded: “Mr Cheatham had an episode of psychotic depression with delusions which caused him to commit a homicide”. 
     
      
    89    Dr Koller expressed the opinion that the Appellant “suffered a deep seated psychotic depression with paranoid hypochondriacal delusion”. Further “Mr Cheatham was in a deep psychotic depression. He was mentally ill at the time of the murders. There was a defect of reason and he did not know the quality of his acts and what he was doing was wrong”. 
     
      
    90    I note, with respect to this last statement, that the case proceeded at first instance, and in this Court, solely on the second limb. There was a considerable body of evidence, including the two letters, that the Appellant knew “the quality of his acts”. 
     
      
    91    The Crown submitted that this evidence is not new. It simply adds two more psychiatrists’ opinions to those of the two psychiatrists who gave evidence before the jury. I accept this submission. 
     
      
    92    In my opinion, the reports of Dr Lucire and Dr Koller do not differ from the evidence of Dr Milton and Dr Nielssen to any material degree. There is substantial overlap, if not precise coincidence, of the thrust of the two sets of Appellant’s expert opinions. (See R v Ion (1996) 89 A Crim R 81 at 92-95). 
     
      
    93    There is no reason to conclude that if the new evidence was placed before a jury, that there is a “significant possibility” that it would acquit or that it “might entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt” of the Appellant. 
     
      
    94    In my opinion ground 6 fails. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    95    The orders I propose are: 
     
      
      1 Appeal allowed. 
       
      2 A new trial to be held. 
       
       
      
    96    JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    97    SPERLING J: I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice and with his reasons.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    2   HULME J: In these matters, I agree with the orders proposed by Dowd J and generally with his Honour’s reasons. In relation to the appeal against the 1999 conviction, I wish to add some further observations. 
     
      
       
      
    3   Firstly, I have considerable reservations concerning the correctness of the remarks of Wood CJ at CL in R v Williams [1999] NSWCCA 9 upon which the Appellant relied. Although those remarks received the concurrence of the Chief Justice and McInerney J, I have difficulty in reconciling them with the logical consequences of the direction which s405B(2)(b) of the Crimes Act, 1900 - recently replaced by s107 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1986 - required and with remarks of the majority of the High Court in Crofts v R (1996) 186 CLR 427. 
     
      
       
      
    4   Having said that the trial judge’s direction in that case literally complied with s405B(2), Wood CJ at CL went on:- 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Had his Honour gone further and identified possible but unexpressed reasons why the particular complainant had remained silent for five years, then this ground of appeal would in my view have been made good. To have taken that course would have gone beyond the statutory requirement, and it would have risked sowing seeds in the minds of the jurors for which there was no evidentiary basis. It may have unwittingly misled the jury into assuming that there was in fact some other reason, unexpressed by the complainant, but known to the judge, for her silence. His Honour stopped short of speculating in that regard, or of inviting any consideration of specific reasons which had not been offered. Although his observations concerning “101 or 1001 reasons” would have been better avoided, I am not persuaded that error has been demonstrated in that respect.” 
         
        
       
      
    5   What the trial judge had said concerning “101 or 1001 reasons” was:- 
     
      
       
        
         
         “I’m hesitating myself to start suggesting things to you because there might be no end to that. I’m sure if you all think about this in a general way not applying your mind to this case for the moment, you may be able to think of 101 reasons why a woman might not complain immediately about an event that occurred. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         As I said, you could imagine not (sic) 101, 1001 reasons why something like that might occur or not occur.” 
         
        
       
      
    6   Section 405B(2) provided:- 
     
      
       
        
         
         “(2) Where on the trial of a person for a prescribed sexual offence evidence is given or a question is asked of a witness which tends to suggest an absence of complaint in respect of the commission of the alleged offence by the person upon whom the offence is alleged to have been committed or to suggest delay by that person in making any such complaint, the Judge shall: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) give a warning to the jury to the effect that absence of complaint or delay in complaining does not necessarily indicate that the allegation that the offence was committed is false; and 
         
        
        
         
         (b) inform the jury that there may be good reasons why a victim of a sexual assault may hesitate in making, or may refrain from making, a complaint about the assault.” 
         
        
       
      
    7   Implicitly, by a direction in accordance with that provision, a jury is directed to consider what reasons occur to them, whether those reasons are “good” and whether they did or may have provided a sufficient reason, consistent with the truth of the evidence given in Court, for a complainant having delayed in, or abstained from, complaining. It may be inferred that they are asked to rely in this exercise on their own experience of the world and, in effect, to speculate on what factors may have operated on the complainant in the case before them. 
     
      
       
      
    8   If that be correct, I have the greatest difficulty in understanding why a trial judge, with commonly the greater experience and consideration of the topic which participation in other trials is calculated to bring, should be foreclosed from suggesting possible reasons for a jury’s consideration. 
     
      
       
      
    9   In Crofts v R at 444 the majority of the High Court quoted from the summing up of the judge whose remarks were the subject of the appeal and said that, isolated from another passage which was ultimately held to be objectionable, what had been said represented an unexceptionable instruction. So far as is presently relevant, what the trial judge had said was:- 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The experience of the law confirms that complaints are often not made immediately after sexual assaults. [The prosecutor], in his address to you, suggested that she was young, confused, [had] feelings of guilt, fear of disbelief, fear of family upheaval, fear of accusation against a family friend. [These] were all suggestions that were put forward that may explain such a delay, and there may well be others. Experience has shown that it is not uncommon for such a delay and the law requires me to say that it does not necessarily mean the allegations are false.” 
         
        
       
      
    10   Considered in isolation, this passage demonstrates that the argument here, depending as it does on remarks by the Crown Prosecutor, is doomed to failure.  
     
      
       
      
    11   Returning to Crofts v R, at page 451 in talking of the Victorian equivalent to ss 405B and 405C(2), the majority said (omitting references):- 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The overriding duty of the trial judge remains to ensure that the accused secures a fair trial. It would require much stronger language than appears in s61 of the Act to oblige a judge, in a case otherwise calling for comment, to refrain from drawing to the notice of the jury aspects of the facts of the case which , on ordinary human experience, would be material to the evaluation of those facts.” 
         
        
       
      
    12   In context the reference to “aspects of the facts of the case” clearly is not limited to the evidence alone and the tenor of the passage seems to me quite inconsistent with the idea that the judge may not suggest matters of his or her own ordinary human experience, and whether or not derived in part from judicial experience. Although the Victorian provision contained a further sub-section to the effect that nothing in the sub-section corresponding with s405B(2) prevents a judge from making a comment on evidence that it is appropriate to make in the interests of justice, the passage quoted clearly does not depend on the existence of that further provision. 
     
      
       
      
    13   Remarks at the top of page 449 of the report tend in the same direction as the passages to which I have referred. 
     
      
       
      
    14   Nor do I find persuasive the passage in the judgment in Williams v R that “It may have unwittingly misled the jury into assuming that there was in fact some reason, unexpressed by the complainant, but known to the judge, for her silence.” The words quoted seem to involve the assumption that a jury will ignore the instruction always given that the jury should decide a case on the evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    15   And even if the passage just quoted be correct as applied to remarks of a judge, would it apply to remarks in counsels’ addresses? On other topics too? The logical application of the proposition is likely to make either counsels’ addresses much abbreviated or lead to innumerable appeals. 
     
      
       
      
    16   A further basis upon which I would dismiss the appeal lies in the proviso to s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act. Even if the law is as stated by Woods CJ at CL in Williams v R, I would not readily infer that mention by the Crown Prosecutor in address of matters of the nature presently under consideration could amount to error creating substantial injustice. There is a vast difference between mention by the judge (whose words even on matters other than law are commonly said to have the force of his office behind them) and mention in address by counsel.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    17   DOWD J: The Appellant, Bruce James Creed, was indicted before Sides DCJ at Liverpool District Court on 9 June 1998 under s.61D(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (“the Act”) of two counts of sexual intercourse without consent with a person under the age of sixteen years. On 12 June 1998 the jury returned verdicts of guilty to Count 1 and not guilty to Count 2. The Appellant was sentenced on count 1 on 4 September 1998 to a minimum term of eighteen months penal servitude to commence on 4 September 1998 and to expire on 3 March 2000, and an additional term of eighteen months to commence on 4 March 2000 and to expire on 3 September 2001. The Appellant has appealed against that conviction. 
     
      
       
      
    18   The appellant was further indicted on 24 November 1998 before O’Reilly DCJ under s.61E(1) of the Act of indecent assault and one count of carnal knowledge under s.67 of the Act. On 25 November 1998 the jury returned a verdict of guilty to Count 2, the carnal knowledge charge, but were unable to reach a verdict in relation to Count 1, the indecent assault charge. The Appellant was sentenced on count 2 to three years penal servitude to commence on 5 February 1999 and to expire on 4 February 2002 and an additional term of two years to commence on 5 February 2002 and to expire on 4 February 2004. The Appellant has appealed against that conviction.  
     
      
       
      
    19   The complainants in both cases are sisters and knew the Appellant as a family friend of their father. The Appellant would often visit the complainants’ family, stopping for coffee or just to chat. The visits gradually became more frequent and the Appellant developed a close friendship with the complainants’ family. The Appellant would sometimes spend the night at the complainants’ house and in about 1984, the Appellant bought a caravan and moved into residence in the caravan in the yard of their house. 
     
      
       
      
    20   Apart from the close friendship with the complainants’ family and living with them the Appellant would often babysit the complainants and their sisters when the complainants’ parents went out. On several occasions when the Appellant babysat the complainants he would stay overnight at the complainants’ house. 
     
      
       
      
    The 1998 conviction 
     
      
       
      
    21   The first complainant, who was born on 2 April 1974 grew up in Auburn, the eldest of four daughters and met the Appellant when she was about seven or eight. The Appellant was a friend of her father. 
     
      
       
      
    22   On 19 November 1983, the first complainant’s parents celebrated their eleventh wedding anniversary at the Lowenbrau Keller and arranged for the Appellant to babysit the four children. When the other children had gone to bed the first complainant gave evidence that the Appellant told her to go and have a shower. Whilst the she was in the shower, the Appellant came in, turned off the water, and told the first complainant to get dressed because it was time for her to learn “the facts of life”. The date and fact of the babysitting was corroborated by the complainants’ mother and father. 
     
      
       
      
    23   The first complainant’s evidence was that she left the shower and put on her nightie but not her underpants and walked out into the kitchen. In the kitchen she saw the Appellant standing near the kitchen sink and two chairs which had been placed opposite each other. The Appellant told her to sit down on one of the chairs and he sat in the chair opposite her. The Appellant then put his hand underneath her nightie and his fingers in her vagina. The first complainant told him to stop and that it was hurting but the Appellant ignored the complainant and continued to move his fingers around inside her vagina. He grinned and told her that it would feel all right soon. When the Appellant finished he told her not to say anything otherwise she would not see her father again. The first complainant got up and went to bed. Her evidence was that she was too scared to speak to anyone. 
     
      
       
      
    24   Between November 1983 and April 1984, the Appellant babysat the first complainant and her sisters several times whilst their parents were working on their milk run. On each of those occasions the first complainant said that the Appellant would make the first complainant sit under a blanket with him on the lounge whilst she and the other children watched television. Whilst sitting under the blanket the Appellant would put his fingers in her vagina. This would happen once or twice a week. 
     
      
       
      
    25   The first complainant did not complain about these events until some time in 1997. She said in evidence that she was scared that her father was going to leave if she had said something. 
     
      
       
      
    26   At the trial an old school friend of the first complainant gave evidence about a conversation she had with the first complainant in 1984 when they were both in the fifth grade. The witness who was concerned about the first complainant had asked her on numerous occasions what was wrong but the first complainant would say “nothing” until on one occasion when the first complainant said “Bruce hurts me, he does stuff to me, he does things to me.” The friend knew who the Appellant was. 
     
      
       
      
    27   The appellant agreed that he had babysat the first complainant and her sisters. His case was that he met the first complainant’s father in June 1983 when he commenced working for a towing company . He said that he became friendly with the family and that he would frequently visit their place and that after some time he moved into a caravan in their yard. It was then that the appellant would help with the milk run on a regular basis, averaging at least three nights per week. The appellant further gave evidence that he had gone to Queensland over December 1983 to attend a wedding. The Appellant in his evidence denied the offences. 
     
      
       
      
    28   The ground of appeal was that His Honour erred in law in granting the Crown leave pursuant to s.108(3) of the Evidence Act 1995 (“the Evidence Act”) to adduce evidence of the school friend as being evidence of a prior consistent statement of the first complainant in circumstances where it has been suggested that the first complainant has fabricated her evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    29   The Appellant challenged the admission on the basis that the friend’s evidence was not capable of being a prior consistent statement in the absence of evidence of the first complainant that she had made the statement to the witness. The Appellant submitted that His Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion to admit the evidence but in any event as a matter of law it could not be admitted under s.108 of the Act as it did not constitute a prior consistent statement and further that the evidence ought to have been excluded under s.137 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
       
      
    30   This last point was not argued at the trial but it is competent in terms of an objection to raise new grounds in support of that objection provided the original objection was taken at the trial.  
     
      
       
      
    31   The first complainant did not give evidence about her conversation with her friend and was not cross-examined generally about the conversation, the only question being put to her was as to whether she had complained “the next day”. Her friend was only cross-examined as to the timing of the statement but there was no challenge in cross-examination to the content or wording of the statement itself.  
     
      
       
      
    32   The actual statement related by the friend was; 
     
      
       
        
         
         “She was upset, I walked up to her and I was worried about her so I asked her “What’s wrong”, and she was very withdrawn she would not answer and she didn’t want to, she was upset. I asked her, “What’s wrong, what’s wrong”, she told me, “Bruce hurts me, Bruce does stuff to me”. At that point I, you know I asked “What, what does he do to you ?” “He does things to me”, that’s all I got from her.” 
         
        
       
      
    33   The Appellant says that the friend’s evidence in terms does not identify precisely what the first complainant was referring to or who the person identified as “Bruce” was. The first complainant had testified that she had never told anyone of the incidents alleged. It was put that this evidence is contrary to the other evidence she gave and is in any event irrelevant. The Appellant put it that there was a critical link missing between the actual evidence of the friend and the evidence of the plaintiff and that the friend did not precisely identify what the complainant was referring to. 
     
      
       
      
    34   The friend’s evidence in the trial was that “Bruce was the little man who lived out in the caravan in their backyard”. There was therefore evidence of her knowledge of the Appellant. There was clear evidence from which it could be inferred that the friend was referring to the accused. The complaint was also related to Count 1 in the indictment which was that in respect of which the Appellant was found guilty. 
     
      
       
      
    35   The evidence of a complaint does not require that the evidence be given by both the complainant and the complainee. It is evidence that can be give by either. In the case of R -v- Rawlings, unreported CCA 10 December 1998, it was in fact only the evidence of the complainant but was nevertheless admitted.  
     
      
       
      
    36   The trial judge warned the jury in very strong terms about the friend’s evidence and no objection was taken to that warning. In my view the evidence of the first complainant’s friend was capable of corroborating the complainants’ evidence of the actions of the Appellant. It is not necessary for corroboration to precisely repeat the actual terms of the offence. It was a matter for the jury as to whether a proper inference should be drawn of the relationship between the friend’s evidence and that of the first complainant’s. There was sufficient evidence for the jury to decide if the “link” can be found to the corroborating evidence.  
     
      
       
      
    37   I accept the submission of the Crown that with the age of the first complainant at the time there would be a reluctance to tell her friend precisely what happened. 
     
      
       
      
    38   I reject the submission that the evidence of the friend is contrary to that of the complainant. As a matter of logic the fact that the first complainant does not remember the conversation did not mean the conversation did not occur.  
     
      
       
      
    39   The Appellant further contended that His Honour the trial judge should have excluded the evidence under s.137 of the Evidence Act. Section 137 of the Evidence Act creates an obligation on the part of the trial judge to weigh up the probative value of the evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice. Despite the fact that it comes under the heading of “Discretions” under the Evidence Act it is not an exercise of discretion as such. The trial judge in looking at the probative value of the evidence must first establish that there is a prejudice and then assess whether there is a danger of unfair prejudice. (R -v- Blick, unreported CCA 14 March 2000). There is nothing in the nature of the evidence of the friend which is prejudicial as such, either because of its age or its lack of precision.  
     
      
       
      
    40   The evidence is admissible and has clear probative value and even if prejudicial it is certainly not unfairly prejudicial nor is there a danger of unfair prejudice outweighing the probative value of the evidence which was, in my view, properly admitted.  
     
      
       
      
    41   The appeal therefore fails and should be dismissed. The 1999 conviction 
     
      
       
      
    42   The second complainant who was born on 22 January 1976 met the appellant when she was about six years old.  
     
      
       
      
    43   Some time after Christmas 1984 and before Easter 1985 the second complainant’s parents went out and left the second complainant and one of her sisters at home with the Appellant.  
     
      
       
      
    44   The second complainant’s evidence was that at some point during the day the Appellant asked the second complaint’s sister to go to the shops to buy ice creams. When she left the Appellant picked up the second complainant and carried her into the caravan.  
     
      
       
      
    45   The second complainant was kicking and screaming. The Appellant laid her on the bed, put his hand on her stomach and removed her underpants. The appellant held her arms up and pushed her knees apart with his knees. He then put his penis in her vagina. The second complainant was screaming and told the appellant not to do it. The Appellant then lifted himself off the second complainant. She ran out of the caravan and hid underneath it. Later, when she was having a shower she noticed there was blood on her pants and between her legs. 
     
      
       
      
    46   The next day after this incident the appellant told the second complainant that if she ever told her parents what happened he would take her away from them. 
     
      
       
      
    47   The complainants’ parents confirmed the circumstances of the Appellant coming to live in a caravan on the property and the timing of first meeting the Appellant and his departure prior to Christmas 1985. 
     
      
       
      
    48   The appellant denied the offence in a Police Electronic Record of Interview as he did in evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    49   The Appellant gave evidence of the facts as outlined above including the purchase of the caravan and its location on the complainants’ parents property in September 1984. The Appellant agreed that he had slept at the house and had babysat on occasions. He moved out in 1985. 
     
      
       
      
    50   The Appellant appeals from His Honour’s decision stating that His Honour erred in law in declining to discharge the jury when requested by then Counsel for the Appellant because of certain matters raised in the closing address of the Crown Prosecutor.  
     
      
       
      
    51   The relevant passage which was the foundation for the application for discharge was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “You also heard that Debbie Wyer did not go to the police till 1997. His Honour will tell you about that, what the law is about that, and if I say anything that is not correct his Honour will correct me. But what I would like to suggest to you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, with great respect, is that we have to look at this question not from the sophisticated eyes of an adult but from the eyes of a child of six years and eight years and ten years and one of the great advantages of a jury system is this, that the twelve of you represent not only the community’s combined sense of justice and fair play but you also bring with you a fairly large pool of common sense and knowledge of human affairs and it is that knowledge of human affairs that the law says you must bring into play when you deliberate in the jury room. Therefore, your own knowledge of human affairs will tell you, I suggest with respect, that there are very many reasons why young children especially do not complain. Ignorance, shame, the fear of not being believed, threats and all these, if they are in play, does not mean that a late complaint or late reporting is a false reporting. Your own experience of the world must tell you that there are many cases coming up in Australia now which are many, many years old. People are becoming more aware of their rights, people are being encouraged to come forth. It is no longer a pressure to hide this sort of thing in the closet. People are in fact encouraged. Your own knowledge of what goes on in New South Wales will tell you there’s Operation Paradox every year which invites people to come forth. So a delay is not of itself a factor that would brand an allegation as a lie or as a fabrication. 
         
        
        
         
         You heard that in this case there was a threat to Debbie Wyer, “if you tell I’ll take your parents away” - “I’ll take you away from your patents” or words to that effect. Now it was suggested to her “Well your father is bigger than Mr Creed”, but that’s a suggestion today to a grown-up lady. One must judge that threat and analyse it through the eyes of a six year old. Mr Creed himself told you that not only the parents brought them up to obey, to listen, to do what was told, but he said “Whatever I told them they knew they had to do.” That was the atmosphere in which young Debbie Wyer was brought up. The law of the adult, the order of the adult, it had to be obeyed, and maybe you might say to yourselves this is the reason Debbie Wyer went to the wedding reception. You might say to yourselves she was keeping this inside her and wasn’t prepared to face her father’s question as to why she wouldn’t go to the wedding reception because you’ll realise that at the time there were no allegations made against Mr Creed. You might say to yourselves well so as not to make explanation, so as not to divulge what had been eating her for years, she chose the easy way out and went and accompanied her parents to the wedding reception. It is for the same reason that Mrs Kutnyak takes her to the reception. They didn’t know. They still looked upon Mr Creed as a trusted friend, as a good friend, as a close friend. 
         
        
        
         
         Again, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, most of you are parents and all of you have been young children. You bring that experience to bear on your deliberations. It is only then you will be able to fully appreciate I submit what Debbie Wyer went through and why Debbie Wyer held it inside her for so long and you might say to yourself well there comes a time when one says “Well I can’t bottle this up any longer, I’ve got to do something about it”. Is that alien to one’s experience ? Is that so far removed from what people do in their daily lives, during their lives, that it cannot be believed, that it cannot be accepted ? There comes a time when one just snaps and says “Well I can’t take it any longer.”  
         
        
       
      
    52   The basis for the application for discharge was that the prosecutor had put before the jury, argumentatively, a number of matters for which there was no evidence. This, it is put, was particularly inappropriate where a direction in terms of Longman -v- The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 would customarily be given to cover such circumstances.  
     
      
       
      
    53   It was further contended that it is prejudicial to allow the prosecutor to traverse freely the grounds of possible explanation for the delay in complaint, and in particular referring to a program in NSW for making complaints when the second complainant was in Queensland and that the prosecutor made unsupported assertions about events otherwise covered in the evidence. The grounds of appeal is that this speculation unfounded in evidence causes distraction and confusion and can only be answered by a similar range of possible alternatives.  
     
      
       
      
    54   Counsel for the Appellant did not argue that His Honour’s summing up was not balanced but put it that, in fairness to the Appellant, an unfair summing up was indicated to counter the damage done by the Crown Prosecutor in his address and that His Honour had indicated at the time of refusing the application to discharge the jury that he would say something. In short, the appellant was saying, that if he didn’t get a discharge he was entitled to a more favourable summing up, and as he didn’t get the summing up he wanted, he appealed against the decision not to discharge the jury. 
     
      
       
      
    55   The Crown Prosecutors remarks in making general comments about reasons for complaint were inappropriate and this is conceded by the Crown. They do infringe the requirements of Regina -v- Williams [1999] NSWCCA 9 but in that case it was, of course, the trial judge that made the comments not a Crown Prosecutor followed by the judicial summing up. 
     
      
       
      
    56   In these proceedings His Honour adverted to the remarks of the Crown Prosecutor and the comments by counsel for the Appellant. His Honour reminded the jury that there was no evidence of the complainant’s motivation and mental processes. There is no objection to the summing up which His Honour gave and no issue was raised after that summing up by counsel in the trial. A trial must be looked at in terms of the atmosphere of the trial itself.  
     
      
       
      
    57   The difficulty I have with the ground of appeal is that it is not as such a ground of appeal against the failure to discharge the jury but an appeal based on the failure of the trial judge to make balancing comments having refused that discharge. Although it is pointed out by counsel for the Appellant that His Honour appeared to contemplate some appropriate comment, in the end his remarks being balanced left the issue to the jury. It is evidence of the trial atmosphere that it was the Appellant’s counsel in the trial who had made the discharge application who sought no redirection after the summing up. 
     
      
       
      
    58   The authorities relating to the discharge of the jury oblige the trial judge in the atmosphere of the trial to decide whether it is necessary to discharge the jury in the interests of a fair trial (R-v- George (1987) 9 NSWLR 527 at 533). In my view the directions to the jury would have put the questions of reasons for complaint in proper context notwithstanding the inappropriateness of counsel’s comments I do not consider that it has been shown that the failure to discharge the jury was an incorrect decision and in the event the Appellant has not shown that His Honour has not erred in the balance achieved in the summing up. In my view the appeal fails and should therefore be dismissed.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JWednesday, 9 August 200070085/99 - REGINA v Ka Lok LEUNGSENTENCE1   HIS HONOUR: The offender Ka Lok Leung has pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact of the murder by Pak Lun Chan on 21 February 1999 at Marsfield of Navid Khan. 
     
      
    2   The offender was at the time a young man of almost twenty years, a native of Hong Kong, where his family were resident, and on his own studying in Australia. His circle of acquaintances was necessarily limited and he had no support of family or family friends such as a young man of that age might ordinarily have. 
     
      
    3   During the early hours of Sunday 21 February 1999 he was in the company of a friend of his, Pak Lun Chan, at Marsfield. They were playing cards and apparently had a good deal to drink. At 4.30 am they went together to a nearby service station where there was a shop that sold food. 
     
      
    4   Whilst they were in the shop, some conversation took place between the man in charge of the business, Navid Khan, and the two of them. He asked in a reasonable and friendly way whether they lived in the district. The offender replied, in a manner whose brusqueness was quite uncalled for, that it was none of his fucking business. He repeated the expression and Mr Khan reasonably again, I think, asked why he was being spoken to in such language. The foul words continued and Mr Khan responded in kind. 
     
      
    5   The behaviour of the offender was reprehensible, but it must be observed that it was not calculated to bring about the events that then happened and no part of the charge to which he has pleaded guilty comprehends that behaviour. 
     
      
    6   The offender left the shop after the exchange I have summarised, but Chan remained. 
     
      
    7   Mr Khan tried to reason with Chan and Chan responded by pulling out a loaded pistol and shooting Mr Khan in the chest. Mr Khan lived long enough to activate an alarm which brought the police quickly to the premises, but by then he was dead. 
     
      
    8   As soon as he shot the deceased, Chan ran from the shop. The evidence does not enable me to say where the offender was during the last seconds of Mr Khan’s life, but the inference is, I think, that he was not far away and I feel sure that he did not leave the premises other than in the knowledge that his colleague had fired the weapon. Perhaps he did not know that the deceased was dead or dying. 
     
      
    9   The two returned to the premises at Marsfield, but some hours later went together to the offender’s premises at Kingsford. I am satisfied that by that stage the offender knew that Mr Khan was dead and that his friend had shot him. 
     
      
    10   The offender knew that Chan wanted to lie low for as long as necessary and get away. He knew that Chan was trying to make arrangements by telephone to book travel from Sydney to other places. There is no evidence and no suggestion that the offender was actively involved in those arrangements, however, and his criminality is in harbouring Chan for a period of forty-eight hours or so by providing accommodation for him in the knowledge of the killing he had carried out and with the intention of assisting him in that way to avoid detection and, if his arrangements should prove successful, get away. 
     
      
    11   In fact, the arrangements were to some extent successful and Chan got as far as Tullamarine Airport, Melbourne before he was arrested and charged. 
     
      
    12   Chan has been diagnosed by an eminent psychiatrist as suffering from Tourette Syndrome and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder. According to the evidence of Dr Wong, persons who suffer from those disorders, or at least in the combination in which Chan suffered from them, may be prone to outbursts of violence. Why Chan shot Mr Khan is not relevant for present purposes, though what Dr Wong has said may well go some way towards explaining something which on the face of it is inexplicable. The value of the evidence in the present case is that it supports the claim by the offender to have been afraid of Chan, and I accept the submission that he had such a fear. 
     
      
    13   The assessment of his criminality has to take into account the fairly isolated position in which the offender found himself, his immaturity and his attitude towards his friend who was obviously a man prepared to resort, without warning, to violent conduct. Of course, that criminality does not comprehend anything that took place in the shop and there is no suggestion that the offender had any knowledge that Chan was likely to shoot Mr Khan. 
     
      
    14   I think that the offender’s action is explained in the manner I have summarised. I think he was surprised at what had happened and put in great fear when he eventually learned that Mr Khan had died. 
     
      
    15   Some long time later, on 30 March 1999, the offender had not been spoken to by the police. Whether he would have avoided the attention of the police is problematical, but on that day he voluntarily handed himself in at the police station. He had with him his family, who had travelled from Hong Kong, and his solicitor, who had given him some advice. He exercised his right of silence. He was arrested and spent twenty-four days in custody before being released to bail. 
     
      
    16   During his period of bail, which has now gone on for more than a year, he has applied himself diligently to studies in English and general academic subjects as well as in graphic design, a subject for which he appears to have some aptitude. Those teaching him are very impressed with his progress and his attitude. 
     
      
    17   I am satisfied that he is sorry for having acted in the way that he did and I think that his rehabilitation is well under way. I am satisfied that the risks of his reoffending are small. 
     
      
    18   Mr Lloyd has submitted that the imposition of a suspended sentence would be within the range of sentencing discretion of the Court and the Crown Prosecutor has agreed with that submission. 
     
      
    19   It seems to me, in all the circumstances, that I should impose a suspended sentence and that is what I propose to do. 
     
      
    20   Ka Lok Leung, I sentence you to imprisonment for two years commencing today 9 August 2000 and expiring on 8 August 2002. I suspend the sentence and direct your release on the condition that you enter into a bond for the same period of two years. 
     
      
    21   The conditions of the bond will be: 
     
      
       
      (1) that you will appear before this Court, if called upon to do so, at any time during the term of the bond; 
       
       
      (2) that you be of good behaviour; 
       
       
      (3) that you reside at Unit 4, 260 Bondi Road Bondi; 
       
       
      (4) that you inform the Manager of the Criminal Registry of this Court within twenty-four hours of any change in your residential address; 
       
       
      (5) that within forty-eight hours after your release you present yourself to the officer-in-charge of the Probation and Parole Service at Bondi Junction; 
       
       
      (6) that during the term of the bond you subject yourself to the supervision of the officers of that Service; 
       
       
      (7) that, if called upon to do so, you attend and give evidence at the trial of Pak Lun Chan.

       REGINA v JOSEPH ALIPERTI 
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1   JAMES J: Joseph Aliperti has applied for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him in the District Court on 3 December 1999 by his Honour Judge Shadbolt, after the applicant had been found guilty by a jury of one charge of dishonestly obtaining a valuable thing by deception, an offence under s 178BA of the Crimes Act, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for five years. 
     
      
    2   Judge Shadbolt took into account in sentencing the applicant seven other offences, consisting of six offences under s 178BA and one offence of fraudulently omitting to account, an offence under s 178A of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    3   Judge Shadbolt sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment for five years, consisting of a minimum term of three years nine months and an additional term of one year three months. 
     
      
    4   The objective facts of the offence can be briefly summarised as follows. The applicant was a solicitor. The victim of the offence, Mr Ferraro, was a client of the applicant's. Mr Ferraro told the applicant he had money on deposit with a bank but that he was dissatisfied with the rate of interest he was receiving. The applicant told Mr Ferraro he had another client, Mr Cassaneti, who from time to time needed to borrow money. Subsequently, Mr Ferraro asked the applicant to invest for him the moneys which had been on deposit with the bank. 
     
      
    5   The applicant produced to Mr Ferraro a loan agreement expressed to be between Mr Ferraro and his wife of the one part and Mr Cassaneti of the other part. The loan agreement bore a signature purporting to be the signature of Mr Cassaneti. However, this signature had been forged by the applicant and Mr Cassaneti had no knowledge of the alleged transaction. 
     
      
    6   The moneys which Mr Ferraro had for investment, amounting to $135,000, were deposited in the applicant's office account and then disbursed in payment of a number of the applicant's creditors. 
     
      
    7   It would appear from the form under s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act that most of the other six offences under s 178BA of the Crimes Act were committed in a similar way, by the applicant dishonestly obtaining for himself a bank cheque or a personal cheque from a client by a deceptive representation that another client of the applicant's practice was seeking to borrow money. The amounts dishonestly obtained by the applicant in committing these other offences ranged from slightly more than $15,000 to $75,000. 
     
      
    8   All of the offences committed by the applicant were committed over a period of approximately four months, between February 1992 and June 1992. 
     
      
    9   The sentencing judge regarded the applicant's offences as serious. In his remarks on sentence his Honour said that he regarded the applicant as having stolen the money from his clients. His Honour said that ""they"" (that is the offences) ""were utterly disgraceful acts of dishonesty"". Later in his remarks on sentence his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""These deceptions happened over a considerable period of time and involved not institutions but individuals, none of whom could afford the loss or absorb it. They also involved substantial sums of money."" 
        
       
      
    10   His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I see these offences as being in the top band of the most serious of their kind."" 
        
       
      
    11   In his remarks on sentence his Honour mentioned some of the subjective circumstances of the applicant. At the time of sentencing the applicant was fifty years old and married, with two children. His Honour found that up until the time the applicant committed the offences he had been a person of good character. In consequence of the commission of the offences, the applicant had been struck off as a solicitor and had been made bankrupt. His Honour noted that the applicant continued to maintain in the proceedings on sentence that he was not himself to blame and that Mr Cassaneti had owed him money. 
     
      
    12   His Honour concluded that because of the objective gravity of the offence, including the breach of trust as a solicitor, and notwithstanding the subjective matters which were urged on behalf of the applicant, a sentence equal to the maximum sentence for an offence under s 178BA should be imposed and that the additional term of that sentence should not exceed one-third of the minimum term. 
     
      
    13   In this application it was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing judge had made some specific errors in sentencing the applicant and that in any event the sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    14   It was submitted that the sentencing judge had accepted, and had obviously been influenced by, an assertion made by the Crown Prosecutor in the proceedings on sentence about the total amount dishonestly obtained by the applicant. It was submitted that this assertion was not supported by the evidence and had been disputed by counsel for the applicant in the proceedings on sentence. In the proceedings on sentence the following exchange occurred. 
     
      
       
        
        ""COUNSEL FOR THE CROWN: In relation to the matter of Aliperti, your Honour might recall at the conclusion of the trial in this matter I advised your Honour that the Crown was not in a position to put a figure on what the overall defalcations were in the matter. We have been in touch with the Law Society and they have advised they paid out from the Fidelity Fund a total amount of $1.4 million. 
        
       
       
        
        MR CUSACK (Counsel for the prisoner): I might say, your Honour, I accept what my friend is saying but that particular figure is somewhat disputed by my client because some of these people have been paid back before that. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I might say I prefer the Law Society's account of that to your client."" 
        
       
      
    15   It would appear that the figure of $1.4 million mentioned by the Crown Prosecutor, even if it was a correct figure, included amounts which the Crown alleged had been dishonestly obtained by the applicant, over and above the amounts involved in the offence of which the applicant had been found guilty and the offences which were to be taken into account in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Act. 
     
      
    16   It is true that in proceedings on sentence a circumstance of aggravation, if not admitted, must be proved by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt by admissible evidence. Furthermore, there is the point that in sentencing for the single offence and taking into account the seven additional offences, his Honour should not have had regard to amounts included in alleged offences for which he was not sentencing the applicant. 
     
      
    17   There was no dispute that the total amount involved in the offence of which the applicant had been found guilty and the offences to be taken into account was a substantial figure, approximately $400,000. The only finding actually made by the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence about the amounts of money which the applicant had obtained by his deceptive conduct was a finding that ""the deceptions involved substantial sums of money,"" and such a finding was well open to his Honour. 
     
      
    18   It was submitted that his Honour had erred in saying the deceptions had occurred over a considerable period of time, when they had all occurred within a period of about four months. It is true that the deceptive conduct had not, as sometimes happens, extended over a period of years. Nevertheless, the word ""considerable"" is not a word of precise import and the fact that the deceptive conduct had continued over a period of several months warranted his Honour's finding that the deceptions had occurred over a considerable period of time. 
     
      
    19   It was also submitted that his Honour had erred in sentencing the applicant on the basis, apparently, that there had not been any repayment of any money. However, there was no reference at all in his Honour's remarks on sentence as to whether there had been any repayment of any of the money dishonestly obtained and I would not uphold this submission. 
     
      
    20   The submission was also put that his Honour had failed to consider whether something less than a sentence of full-time imprisonment was appropriate. However, in my opinion, it is quite clear that a sentence of full-time imprisonment was required, as was indeed expressly conceded by the applicant's counsel in the proceedings on sentence. It would have been quite otiose for his Honour to say in his remarks on sentence, that no penalty other than a sentence of full-time imprisonment should be imposed. 
     
      
    21   A submission which was particularly pressed by counsel for the applicant at the hearing of this application was a submission that his Honour had failed to have regard to the offences having become stale offences by the time of the sentencing. As I have already noted, all the offences were committed within a period of four months between February and June 1992. The applicant was first arrested in respect of a defalcation by him as a solicitor in September 1992. The applicant did not stand trial until towards the end of 1999 and was sentenced by Judge Shadbolt on 3 December 1999. 
     
      
    22   This Court was presented with chronologies of the events which occurred between the time of the applicant's first arrest in September 1992 and the date of the sentencing. It is clear that on some occasions trial dates which had been fixed were vacated, on the application of the applicant. On those occasions the grounds of the applicant's application were usually related to applications for legal aid or appeals against refusal of legal aid or applications to the Bar Association that the applicant be granted pro bono legal representation. 
     
      
    23   A number of the delays were, however, not delays which could be attributed to the applicant. Some delay was attributable to the problems the authorities confronted in arranging for a trial, which would necessarily be a lengthy trial, of all the offences which it was alleged the applicant had committed. There were also changes of mind on the part of the Crown from time to time, on whether all charges should be preferred against the applicant in a single trial or whether the applicant should be subjected to a series of back-to-back trials. 
     
      
    24   In support of his submission that the delay was a relevant factor, counsel for the applicant referred to the well-known passage in the judgment of Street CJ in R v Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517 at 519 and also referred to a decision of this Court in R v Fahda, (unreported, 31 August 1999). It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the applicant was entitled to some leniency, on the basis he had had the proceedings hanging over his head for approximately seven years. 
     
      
    25   It seems to me that there is force in the submission by counsel for the applicant that the delay between the offences first coming to the notice of the authorities and the sentencing of the applicant was a relevant matter, to which the sentencing judge should have had regard in sentencing the applicant. 
     
      
    26   The sentencing judge had, of course, presided at the trial of the applicant and, as frequently and understandably happens in such circumstances, his Honour's remarks on sentence were fairly brief. However, there being no reference to the factor of delay in his Honour's remarks on sentence, I have been persuaded that his Honour did not have regard to this factor. I am, accordingly, of the opinion that his Honour's sentencing discretion did miscarry. I am accordingly of the opinion that leave to appeal should be granted and that it is necessary for this Court to exercise for itself the sentencing discretion originally exercised by the sentencing judge. The re-sentencing of the applicant should be in accordance with the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    27   I have already referred to the objective facts of the offence and the objective facts of the several offences to be taken into account and I have referred to a number of the subjective features of the applicant. 
     
      
    28   Counsel for the applicant referred, in particular, to the applicant's age and to the likelihood that imprisonment would be particularly onerous for him. On the other hand, the offences which the applicant committed are objectively serious and there is much Court of Criminal Appeal authority that severe sentences are warranted, when a court is sentencing a solicitor for offences of dishonesty committed by him in breach of the trust reposed in him by his clients. 
     
      
    29   In my opinion, a proper sentence to impose would be a sentence of imprisonment for four years. I do not consider there is any reason to find special circumstances. I would accordingly set a non-parole period of three years. The sentence would commence on 5 November 1999. The earliest date on which the applicant would be eligible for release on parole would be 5 November 2002. 
     
      
    30   DOWD J: I agree with the proposed orders of the Presiding Judge and with the reasons expressed there for. 
     
      
    31   JAMES J: The orders of the Court will be as proposed by me.

       JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
    1    POWELL JA: On 30 May 1994, the Appellant was arraigned before McGuire DCJ in the District Court at Gosford on a charge that, on 23 June 1992, at Long Jetty, New South Wales, he did supply a prohibited drug namely heroin (Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 s. 25(1)) - reduced to its essentials, the case which the Crown set out to prove was that on 23 June 1992, when searched by Det. Ison, who was accompanied by Det. Richardson, the Appellant was found to have in the left pocket of his jeans a number of small resealable plastic bags containing white powder, which powder, when analysed, was found to contain heroin, the total weight of the powder being 5.81 grams, that being both a trafficable quantity and an indictable quantity. To that charge the Appellant pleaded not guilty.  
     
      
    2    30 May 1994 was the second occasion on which the Appellant had been indicted on that charge. On 1 June 1993, the Appellant had been arraigned before Urquhart DCJ on that charge and, as in May 1994, had pleaded not guilty. Following that plea, the Appellant had been tried before Urquhart DCJ and a jury of 12, the trial proceeding into the fifth day when, the jury being unable to reach a verdict, they were discharged.  
     
      
    3    At the time of the Appellant’s trial in 1993, he was represented by Mr. G. V. Bellamy, then a solicitor of this Court of some 21 years standing and, as I am led to believe, a solicitor of some experience with criminal law and practice.  
     
      
    4    In an Affidavit sworn by him and tendered on the hearing of this appeal, Mr. Bellamy deposed that the Appellant’s instructions to him throughout the trial before Urquhart DCJ were that he had never been in possession of the heroin said to have been found in his possession and that the drugs had been planted on his person by the arresting police.  
     
      
    5    The transcript of the oral evidence given by Mr. Bellamy on the hearing of the appeal (T.10) records the following, the relevance of which will shortly appear: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And, as I understand it, from what I have seen of the transcript or that part of it, Mr. Boyd’s case before Judge Urquhart was he had been ‘loaded up’? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Loaded up by Dets. Ison or Richardson? A. Yes I think it is. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you recall when you examined Mr. Boyd in chief in the trial before Judge Urquhart you obtained from him evidence that at the time when he was approached by Det. Ison and Det. Richardson there were a number of other patients around about to go into or having just come out of the methadone clinic? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you also recall that you sought from Mr. Boyd evidence as to his having spoken to those other people about giving evidence? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And were those people Mr. and Mrs. Laird,, Mr. McCorrester (sic) and the O’Sullivans? A. Yes, they sound familiar names.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. Those are the people who gave evidence at the Royal Commission, were they? A. I wasn’t aware this matter was before the Royal Commission until I spoke to counsel.” 
        
       
       
      
    6    At the time of the trial before Urquhart DCJ, the Appellant was 38 years of age. He was a long-standing drug user and had, so he said, been addicted to heroin on and off for about 20 years. As McGuire DCJ was to record in his remarks on sentence on 31 May 1994, his criminal history contains numerous convictions relating to the possession of drugs as well as a conviction for the supply of heroin, it being apparently accepted that he was not a major dealer but a small time user/dealer who engaged in supply activities to finance his own addiction. At the time of the alleged offence the Appellant was on a methadone course on which, so he said, he had started about 2½ years prior to the trial before Urquhart DCJ. 
     
      
    7    At the time of the trial before Urquhart DCJ, the Appellant was living in a house at Killarney Vale, which was owned by his mother, together with his de facto wife and three children then aged 12 years, 5 years and 18 months.  
     
      
    8    Between June 1993 and 30 May 1994 when the Appellant was arraigned before McGuire DCJ, the Appellant’s defacto wife had died, a fact of which the Crown was aware - it seems to have been suggested that the death of the Appellant’s de facto wife was drug related. 
     
      
    9    As a result of the death of his de facto wife, the Appellant, who seems at all relevant times to have been “on the dole” or in receipt of some form of Social Security benefit, became the sole carer of his three children. 
     
      
    10    When the Appellant was arraigned before McGuire DCJ, he was again represented by Mr. Bellamy, who in the Affidavit to which I have earlier referred, deposed to the fact that, at that time, the Appellant’s instructions to him had not changed.  
     
      
    11    After the jury had been empanelled and McGuire DCJ had made some introductory remarks as to the trial procedure and the respective roles of the jury and himself, the Crown Prosecutor opened the case to the jury and then called as his first witness Det. Richardson.  
     
      
    12    In the light of some of the matters upon which the Appellant relies in support of the appeal, it should be noted that, while in the course of his evidence - both in chief and while being cross-examined by Mr. Bellamy - Det. Richardson gave evidence that, in addition to Det. Ison and himself, two other officers - Det. Sgt. McClelland and Det. Sgt. Eade - from the Drug Unit of the Major Crime Squad North, were part of “the operation” which led to the search and arrest of the Appellant, it was not suggested that either Det. Sgt. McClelland or Det. Sgt. Eade was present outside the methadone clinic at the time of the search and arrest of the Appellant.  
     
      
    13    Det. Richardson was still being cross-examined by Mr. Bellamy when the Court adjourned for lunch on 30 May 1994. 
     
      
    14    It is convenient, here, to pause for the purpose of recording that in the Affidavit sworn by him in support of the appeal, the Appellant deposed (inter alia): 
     
      
       
        
        “5. I decided to change my plea to one of guilty after I was informed that if I were to enter a plea of guilty to the charge I would not be sentenced to serve a full-time custodial sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        6. By the time the second trial occurred my spouse had died. I was the sole carer of our three children, the youngest of whom was 3 years of age. I pleaded guilty from fear of the consequences a full-time custodial sentence would have had for my childrens’ welfare.” 
        
       
       
       
      while in the Affidavit which he had sworn in support of the appeal, Mr. Bellamy deposed (inter alia): 
       
       
        
        “4. The Appellant’s wife died before a re-trial could commence. I was aware that the Appellant had the care of 3 small children and that he was very concerned about the childrens’ future should he be convicted of the charge and given a full-time custodial sentence.” 
        
       
       
      
    15    In the Affidavit which he swore in support of the appeal, Mr. Bellamy also deposed: 
     
      
       
        
        “8. During an adjournment on the first day of the second trial, the Crown Prosecutor raised with me the issue of the appellant receiving a sentence of other than full-time custody should he be willing to enter a plea of guilty. I recall that the Crown Prosecutor told me that should a plea of guilty be forthcoming he would concede that the Judge should sentence the appellant on the basis that he was only supplying friends for the purpose of supporting his own heroin addiction.  
        
       
       
        
        9. I cannot now recall whether the appellant was present during this discussion. It follows that I do not remember the Crown Prosecutor guaranteeing a sentencing result.  
        
       
       
        
        10. I recall raising the question of a plea of guilty with the appellant. He remained extremely concerned for his children should he be convicted and given a full-time custodial sentence. I recall that the appellant instructed me that he would plead guilty to the charge if he could obtain a sentence of other than full-time custody. 
        
       
       
        
        11. At no time throughout the criminal proceedings did the appellant acknowledge to me in any way that he was guilty of the offence.” 
        
       
       
       
      while the transcript of the oral evidence given by Mr. Bellamy on the hearing of the appeal (T. 9) records the following: 
       
       
        
        “Q. Is it the case that you understood from Mr. Boyd that if his Honour was to indicate a sentence with periodic detention Mr. Boyd may be attracted by such a sentence to plead guilty? A. Yes.” 
        
       
       
      
    16    In the Affidavit which was sworn by him for the purposes of the appeal, the Crown Prosecutor deposed (inter alia): 
     
      
       
        
        “3. I have refreshed my memory from the transcript of these proceedings dated 30 May 1994. 
        
       
       
       ……… 
       
       
        
        4. I do not remember the Appellant, Mr. Boyd, but I do remember a case involving Mr. Bellamy. I knew of Mr. Bellamy before this trial but this was the only matter I ever prosecuted involving Mr. Bellamy.  
        
       
       
        
        5. I am able to say that I did not tell anyone what sentence Mr. Boyd would receive. I gave no guarantee to any person on this issue. All my dealings were with Mr. Bellamy. In May 1994 a sentencing indication scheme existed in this State. Mr. Boyd was not technically entitled to a sentence indication as (to the best of my recollection) such requests had to be made at arraignment.  
        
       
       
        
        6. The purpose of the request for an in-court sentence indication was to enable Mr. Bellamy and his client to be fully appraised of the available options. I have never spoken to any accused in regard to any possible sentence. My attitude towards sentence, as expressed to Mr. Bellamy, was as stated to Judge McGuire as recorded in the transcript. I have no recollection as to whether I first mentioned the prospect of a plea of guilty to Mr. Bellamy or whether he raised the matter with me. However, it is clear from the transcript that Mr. Bellamy must have informed me of a number of subjective matters as I mentioned the death of Mr. Boyd’s wife to Judge McGuire. On the other hand it would not have been unusual for me to ask defence counsel whether there was an prospect of a plea of guilty. The usual practice at Gosford District Court was that at least five trials were listed on each Monday so discussions regarding pleas of guilty were common place (sic).” 
        
       
       
      
    17    The transcript of the hearing before McGuire DCJ (T. 33-35) records the following which occurred after the luncheon adjournment and in the absence of the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour before the jury comes down, there is a matter that my friend and I have spoken about. I would like to raise at this time if that is suitable to your Honour.  
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: It is this your Honour that as your Honour is aware, the accused is at this time certainly, as I understand it, concerned in terms of consequence (sic) that might flow with the result of any finding of guilt in relation to this matter. He, as your Honour has heard, lost his wife just after the last occasion this matter was before the court and has three children, including the youngest of whom is about three or four who he looks after now. I understand your Honour that a certain course may well flow but there is a concern in terms of a full-time custodial imposition. A fulltime custodial sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown’s position your Honour in relation to the matter is that this man has certainly been a long time user who, from time to time in order to support that habit has sold. The Crown’s information in relation to the Crown (sic) says were the circumstances surrounding dealings on this day shows that it wasn’t a profit motivation but rather, well profit in the sense that he wouldn’t have to pay for the own use. By doing what he was doing he would in other words be able to supply himself without having to pay for it so the Crown’s attitude that although he has a number of conviction in relation to drug use and he had a matter that was dealt with just I think in the middle of last year which related to 1991 again in was a similar sort of situation where he was found with a little over 5 grams. His Honour Judge Armitage and placed him on a community service order which, as I understand it, is still in vogue. He has not come under police notice since this date of 23 June 1992 and as I say he is at the moment looking after three young children. 
        
       
       
        
        It is a question of whether your Honour would be prepared to listen further perhaps to this topic and to indicate whether or not a sentence, other than fulltime, and by that I mean either periodic or community service would be within the range rather than a fulltime sentence. Certainly as I understand it, if such was indicated that the fulltime sentence was not on your Honour’s mind, then this matter may well be short.  
        
       
       
        
        Because of the legislation your Honour he was prevented I think from getting an interpretation (sic) of the arraignment because he’d already been arraigned he was prevented from getting an indication or sentence indication under the formal methods of doing it. It wasn’t available to him.  
        
       
       
        
        BELLAMY: Plus of course if it were available in only a one Judge court it means that we would miss out on our trial date for who knows how long. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well I can say this that if he proceeds and if he is convicted and he has prior offences he will certainly go to jail on a fulltime basis. I would say that, but you say that he was precluded from getting a sentence indication.” 
        
       
       
       
      and then, after some discussion as to the Appellant’s criminal history: 
       
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Yes well in those circumstances I consider it is a matter that if there is a plea forthwith, I would consider a penalty short of a fulltime custodial sentence. However I want to make it perfectly clear that that may well mean a lengthy periodic detention. I will also make it quite clear, as I said a while ago that if there is no plea and there is a conviction, there is no doubt that there will be a substantial custodial sentence and I have had regard in particular to the fact that he was subject to a recognisance when this offence was committed.” 
        
       
       
      
    18    The transcript of the oral evidence given by the Appellant on the hearing of the appeal (pp. 5-8) records the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You remember after the luncheon adjournment? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The Crown Prosecutor raised with his Honour that there had been discussions? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were in court when that was said? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And there were discussions during the luncheon adjournment about the possibility of a plea? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You spoke to your solicitor about it and your solicitor spoke to you about it - about the possibility of a plea? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
       ……… 
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember before you actually pleaded guilty before you actually stood up in court and pleaded, that you had a private conversation with Mr. Bellamy, that was after his Honour indicated how he might deal with the matter? A. I can’t recall, I suppose I did. You know I would have, yes, I suppose I would have. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Because you were in court when Mr. Bellamy said ‘My instructions are that the accused will plead guilty’? A. yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You do not disagree he said that? A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And they were your instructions? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
       ……… 
       
       
        
        Q. When you came to stand trial before Judge McGuire you knew you had a chance of being found not guilty? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Because the jury on the last occasion could not reach a decision? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I suggest to you the reason you pleaded guilty on 30 May 1994 is because you were guilty? A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Of that offence? A. No I wasn’t guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What I suggest you are doing is, following your obtaining information from the Police Royal Commission you believed that if that information had been before a jury that your chances would have increased of being acquitted? A. I could not take the chance of going to court not losing my kids. I could not take that chance. They had just lost their mother so I took the other one. I was given a guarantee, I mean, I took the other choice. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You know it was a very serious thing to plead guilty to a criminal offence of supplying heroin? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you had persisted in pleading not guilty up to that time? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What occurred when his Honour indicated the sentence that he would hand down if you pleaded guilty is, you thought, well, if that’s all that is going to happen, I will plead guilty. That is what happened, isn’t it? A. No.” 
        
       
       
      
    19    In the course of his remarks on sentence on the following day, McGuire DCJ concluded (T. 2-3): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is my almost invariable practise (sic) to subject those who deal in heroin to full-time custodial sentences, even in cases where they are but small-time dealers. The harm that they do, albeit that they are small-time dealers, is incalculable. The big-time distributor of heroin cannot operate without small entrepreneurs and it must be seen by such would-be backyard, street corner dealers such as Mr. Boyd, that their conduct will attract substantial sentences.  
        
       
       
        
        I propose, however, in this case to depart from my normal practise (sic), having regard to the subjective matters, in particular the fact that Mr. Boyd has observed his obligations under a Community Service Order and the fact that he has three small children as his responsibility. With some misgiving I will not subject him to a full-time custodial sentence, however, he will serve two years by way of periodic detention”. 
        
       
       
      
    20    In an Affidavit sworn by him in support of the appeal, the Appellant’s present solicitor deposed (inter alia) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “9. In 1995 and 1996 the Royal Commission into the NSW Police Service investigated alleged wrong doings by members of the Gosford Drug Unit. 
        
       
       
       ……… 
       
       
        
        10. Officers involved in the prosecution of the appellant, namely Officers Eade, Ison, McClelland and Richardson were the subject of investigation and adverse evidence before the Royal Commission. 
        
       
       
        
        11. The allegation against Detectives Ison and Richardson, the two police officers whom it was alleged had planted heroin upon the applicant included:” 
        
       
       
       
      (There were then set out some six allegations, only two of which were said to involve Det. Richardson, the two occasions being occasions on which it was said that Det. Richardson was present when Det. Ison did something) 
       
       
        
        “12. The applicant understands that Ian Frederick Ison has been committed for trial charged with a conspiracy to act corruptly in the discharge of his duty and with acting with intent to pervert the course of justice (ref. 99/11/1041). The applicant understands that Mr. Ison is to stand trial before the District Court on 8 November 1999. The applicant does not know whether Det. Richardson faces criminal charges.” 
        
       
       
       
      (On the hearing of the appeal we were informed that Det. Ison is now to stand trial in May of this year. There was no suggestion that any criminal charges had been brought against Det. Richardson.) 
       
       
        
        “13. The applicant gave evidence before the Royal Commission about the circumstances of his arrest, as did Diane Ivy Laird, Robert Peter Laird, Lorne McCorriston and Michael John O’Sullivan. Annexed hereto and marked with the letter ‘L’ is a copy of the transcript of the Royal Commission that relates to this evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        14. Glen Stuart Richardson was also questioned by the Royal Commission regarding this matter. Annexed hereto and marked with the letter ‘M’ is a copy of the transcript of the evidence given by Officer Richardson.  
        
       
       
        
        15. Whilst former Detective Ison and other members of the Drug Squad Gosford Drug Squad were required to give evidence before the Royal Commission about other matters, they were not questioned about the Appellant’s case.” 
        
       
       
       
      (Since it was the Appellant’s evidence, both at the trial before Judge Urquhart and in the course of the evidence given by him at the Royal Commission, that the heroin was “planted” on him by Det. Ison, it is curious that, at the Royal Commission, Det. Ison was not questioned about the Appellant’s case; that Det. Sgt. McClelland and Det. Sgt. Eade were not questioned about the Appellant’s case is hardly surprising since there was no suggestion that either was present at the time when the Appellant was searched by Det. Ison.) 
       
       
      
    21    Because of the weight which, at first, appeared to be placed on the evidence given before the Royal Commission by the Appellant, Mr. and Mrs. Laird, Ms. McCorriston and Mr. O’Sullivan, I read that evidence with considerable care. Having done so, I make the following points in relation to it: 
     
      
       
      1. as will be apparent from what I have written above, it was the Appellant’s evidence before the Royal Commission that the heroin was “planted” on him by Det. Ison. His evidence was further that, at the time when, so he said, Det. Ison “planted” the heroin on him, Det. Richardson was searching his (the Appellant’s) car; 
       
       
      2. none of Mr. and Mrs. Laird, Ms. McCorriston and Mr. O’Sullivan gave evidence which would support the Appellant’s allegation that heroin was “planted” on him by Det. Ison; 
       
       
      3. given the case which the Appellant has sought to advance on the hearing of this appeal, some of the evidence given before the Royal Commission (T. 18566-18569) as to what occurred on the hearing on 30 May 1994 before Judge McGuire might be noted: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. Your first trial in relation to this charge resulted in the jury being unable to agree? A. Oh, yes, that’s correct. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. At that trial, evidence was called for the defence from a number of witnesses including a person who gave evidence of being outside the methadone clinic at the time of your arrest? A. Yes. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. Subsequently a second trial was held again at the Gosford District Court? A. Yes. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. And on that occasion, was the second trial on 30 May 1994? A. Yes, that’s right. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. You were indicted and you entered a plea of not guilty? A. Yes that’s right. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. What happened after that was that Detective Richardson was called in the Crown case and gave evidence? A. Yes. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. And was cross-examined by your legal representative? A. I don’t think he was cross-examined. Oh, yes, he was. He was, yes, he just - I don’t know whether - I don’t whether the prosecutor - I don’t know whether he was cross-examined or he just gave - the prosecutor, you know got his evidence. I can’t remember whether my solicitor had started to cross-examine him. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. In any event, part-way through the examination of Mr. Richardson following the luncheon adjournment did you indicate that you proposed now entering a plea of guilty? A. Yes, I did. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. Can you explain why you did that? A. Yes. The police prosecutor come to my solicitor and said that if I pleaded guilty, he’ll make sure I didn’t get a custodial sentence, and like I said, at the time my wife had died and I had the three children on my own, and I didn’t want to risk losing it and them having no one to look after them or being split up. So I decided to do it. The jury - most of the jury consisted of old people. I wasn’t real confident they’d believe me, you know all older people. The first jury - there were a few young people and I felt confident. This jury, I didn't feel confident with. I thought they were older and I thought they would be more inclined to believe the police than me.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. Before you entered the plea of guilty, was it explained to you that it represented an acknowledgment by you that the heroin was yours? A. Yes. Hang on, I knew by pleading guilty I was saying, yes, it was mine, yes, yes, but like I said, I had to weigh up everything. I had to weigh up the - the judge said if I went through - after that the prosecutor approached him, he said that if I decide to go through it and I’m found guilty, I’d get two years straight. So I had to weigh that up, you know, being away from my kids for two years after they’d lost their mother, or getting something - he said he’d give me periodic detention, where I was only for a couple of days a week and, you know, he said ‘It will be a lengthy one’, but I had to weigh that up, anyway. I thought, you know, at the time I thought it was the best thing to do. 
          
         
        
       
       
       ……… 
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. Mr. Boyd, just taking you to how it came about that there were these discussions that led to the prosecutor asking the Judge in open court for an indication about the attitude to sentence … A. Yeah. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. … had you asked your solicitor to inquire of the prosecutor whether or not there was some possibility, if you changed your plea, that you might get treated leniently? A. No. Up until that point in the first trial the police seemed to have, I don’t know, a genuine dislike for me. I never thought that the possibility of getting a lenient sentence or - you know, I never thought that would come up. At the previous trial and the committal, they’d all been, you know, against me and, you know, I was surprised. They seemed to dislike me and were intent on getting me a gaol sentence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. Where did the initiative come from for this discussion that ended up in a form of sentence indication in open court? A. Well, like I said, the prosecutor, come over to my solicitor and me … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. Had anything happened that day to suggest to you or to make you think why that might have occurred? A. Not really. I think - not really. Detective Richardson - the evidence he gave that morning was contradictory to the evidence he gave in the first trial on a number of points. I don’t know whether that had something to do with it. I don’t really know. It was a surprise. They just came to me with it. But he was contradictory that morning on a number of points from the first trial, you know. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. In any event, you say you weighed up the various matters you’ve … A. Yeah. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. … explained in your evidence and decided you would enter a plea of guilty.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      
    22    In the light of what the Appellant’s solicitor said in his Affidavit concerning Det. Richardson, I think it in fairness proper to record a further part of the Appellant’s evidence before the Royal Commission and part of the evidence of Mr. O’Sullivan before the Royal Commission. The transcripts of the Appellant’s evidence before the Royal Commission immediately following the passage which I have just set out records the following (T. 18569-18570): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Subsequently, were you spoken to by police from the Professional Integrity Branch? A. Yes, I was, yes. That was over a year later, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So that was some time last year that you were approached by officers from the Professional Integrity Branch? A. Yes, toward the end of last year. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When they came to see you, what did they explain was the reason for their visit? A. Apparently, Detectives Ison and McClelland, I think, had done a similar thing to someone else and he’d been to see the police integrity board (sic) and then told them to come and see me, that a similar thing had happened to me.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who is the person you understood put the Police Integrity Branch onto you? A. I could find out his name. I forget his second name, but I could find it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What’s his Christian name? A. Michael. 
        
       
       
       ……… 
       
       
        
        Q. So Michael knew that you alleged that you had been set up by these police? A. Yeah, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. As you understand it, Michael told that to the police from the Professional Integrity Branch that he was making a complaint about his own treatment? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
       ……… 
       
       
        
        Q. When had you told him that you had been set up by these police? A. I think - I got refused bail when this happened. When it first happened, I got refused bail and I eventually got bail in the Supreme Court, and it was 10 months, I think, until the court - the case went to trial. I think it was during that 10 months I spoke to him about it - before the trial, between the time of my arrest and the trial.” 
        
       
       
       
      while the relevant part of the evidence of Mr. O’Sullivan (T. 18664-18665) was as follows: 
       
       
        
        “Q. When the police from the Professional Integrity Branch called to see you on the second occasion in July of 1995, after you told them about your own experiences did you mention to them any other people who they might see? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you tell them about a man named Greg who you believed had been loaded with heroin? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you know that man’s full name? A. Greg Boyd. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And are you friendly with Greg Boyd? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How frequently would you see Greg Boyd? A. Depends. Sometimes I wouldn’t see him for six months; sometimes I’d see him a couple of times a day. Just depends. But I see him, you know, at least once a month.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you continue to see him with that frequency now? A. No, I seen him last week but other than that, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Had Greg Boyd given you an account of the circumstances of his arrest? A. No. People at the methadone clinic did. 
        
       
       
       ……… 
       
       
        
        Q. Sir, did Mr. Boyd discuss at any stage the circumstances of what had allegedly happened to him with you? A. Yes; yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he identify officers who he claimed had loaded him? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who did you understand them to be? A. Det. Ison - that was the only one he mentioned.” 
        
       
       
      
    23    Before passing from the subject of the evidence given at the Royal Commission, I should note that the evidence of the Appellant was given on 18 January 1996, while the evidence of Mr. and Mrs. Laird, Ms. McCorriston, Mr. O’Sullivan and Det. Richardson was all given on 22 January 1996. The evidence of the persons referred to in the six matters identified by the Appellant’s solicitor in paragraph 11 of his Affidavit was given on 5 December, 20-21 December, 1995, 16 January and 23 January 1996. 
     
      
    24    The Appellant made no attempt to appeal from his conviction until October 1998, his delay in so doing being explained by him in the Affidavit which he swore in support of the appeal in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “8. In October 1998, I applied for legal aid to assist me to have my conviction overturned. My delay in appealing my conviction was as a result of having no financial ability to fund the appeal. It was only when I became aware that the Legal Aid Commission had established a Royal Commission Unit to assist people who had been wrongly convicted that I realised I could still seek leave of the Court to appeal my conviction. Upon receiving advice I signed my Notice of Appeal and Application for an Extension of Time.” 
        
       
       
      
    25    In the Notice of Appeal, which is dated 18 November 1998, the ground of appeal assigned was “Fresh evidence from the Royal Commission into the NSW Police Service”, while in the notice of Application for Extension of Time which was dated on the same day the reason assigned for no notice of appeal having been lodged within time was “Fresh evidence from the Royal Commission into the NSW Police Service”. 
     
      
    26    In a form of “Grounds of Appeal” filed on 7 June 1999 before the Appeal and Application were first listed for hearing, the ground of appeal assigned was: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Appellant’s conviction constitutes a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
       
      
    27    The Appeal and Application was first listed for hearing on 14 October 1999 before the Court differently constituted. 
     
      
    28    Although in the course of his evidence before the Royal Commission the Appellant suggested that it was the Crown Prosecutor who had initiated the discussion as to a change of plea and that the Crown Prosecutor had given a guarantee as to sentence - each of which suggestions was contested by the Crown Prosecutor then appearing on the hearing of the Appeal and Application - it was understood that the Appellant would not seek to contend that anything turned on that matter and, accordingly, no Affidavit had been obtained from the Crown Prosecutor who had appeared on the hearing before McGuire DCJ as to what had occurred. However, as, in the course of his oral evidence on 14 October 1999, the Appellant said (inter alia) (t.3-4): 
     
      
       
        
        “… The Police Prosecutor come to me. I didn’t go to him, I was, you know up until that time, I was pleading innocent and fighting the case and then he come to me and said: ‘If you nod your head, if you agree to nodding your head, if you agree to this we’ll make sure you don’t get a custodial sentence’ and I said ‘How can you give me a guarantee that the judge will go along with this?’ And he said he would. He said you know, ‘I can give you that guarantee’ so I discussed it with my solicitor.” 
        
       
       
       
      the Court ordered that the appeal and application be stood out of the list and directed that it be placed in the Registrar’s next call-over - this so that an Affidavit as to what occurred might be obtained from the Crown Prosecutor who had appeared on the hearing before McGuire DCJ.  
       
      
    29    The Appeal and Application were then listed for hearing before the Court as presently constituted on 24 March 2000, on which day Mr. G. P. Craddock appeared for the Appellant while Mr. M.C. Marien appeared for the Crown. 
     
      
    30    As is apparent from what I have earlier written, each of the Appellant and the solicitor who had appeared for him on the hearing before McGuire DCJ was called to give evidence and was cross-examined. The Crown Prosecutor who had appeared on the hearing before McGuire DCJ was not required for cross-examination on the Affidavit which he had sworn following the Appeal and Application being stood out of the list on 14 October 1999. 
     
      
    31    As what I have earlier written would indicate, the initial basis upon which the Appellant sought to advance the Appeal and Application was the availability of fresh evidence - being the evidence given before the Royal Commission - which evidence, so it was submitted, satisfied the test for admission of fresh evidence on appeal (in the Written Submissions that were filed on behalf of the Appellant prior to 14 October 1999 reliance was placed on the decision of the High Court in Gallagher v. The Queen  (1985-1986) 160 CLR 392 and the decisions of this Court in R v. Baartman  30 June 1997 (unreported) and R. v. Hasenkamp  24 February 1998 (unreported)). However, while not completely resiling from that position on the hearing of the Appeal and Application by the Court as presently constituted, Mr. Craddock informed the Court “that essentially the application is based upon the proposition that the plea was not entered into borne (sic) of a genuine consciousness of guilty” (T.11), support for that submission being based, in part, upon an observation in the Judgment of the Court of appeal in England in R. v. Turner  [1970] 2 QB 321. 
     
      
    32    That this Court has jurisdiction to set aside a conviction recorded following a plea of guilty is clear enough. In R. Laberti  (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 Kirby P (with whom Grove and Newman JJ agreed) said  at 121-122: 
     
      
       
        
        “POWER TO SET ASIDE A CONVICTION FOLLOWING A GUILTY PLEA 
        
       
       
        
        This Court has power to set aside a conviction recorded following a plea of guilty: see  
        Forde  
        [1923] 2 KB 400 at 403;  
        Gower v. Ross 
         [1959] SASR 278;

         [1960] VR 106;  
        Foley  
        (1963) 80 WN (NSW) 726. From these and other cases it is clear that a court will entertain an appeal against such a conviction, notwithstanding a guilty plea, if it appears: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) that the appellant did not appreciate the nature of the charges or did not intend to admit that he was guilty of them; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that the appellant, upon the admitted facts, could not in law have been convicted of the offence charged; see esp  
        Caruso 
         (1988) 49 SASR 465 at 489; 37 A Crim R 1 at 26. 
        
       
       
        
        For good reasons, courts approach attempts at trial or on appeal in effect to change a plea of guilty or to assert a want of understanding of what was involved in such a plea with caution bordering on circumspection. The attitude rests on the high public interest and the finality of legal proceedings and upon the principle that a plea of guilty by a person in possession of all relevant facts is normally taken to be an admission by that person of the necessary legal ingredients of the offence: see  
        O’Neill 
         [1979] 2 NSWLR 582; (1979) 1 A Crim R 59;

Sagiv  (1986) 22 A Crim R 73, an application pursuant to s.5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 following the refusal of a judge of the District Court to permit the accused to withdraw his plea of guilty, Lee J (with whom McInerney and Campbell JJ agreed) said  at 80-81: 
     
      
       
        
        “There have been a number of cases in regard to withdrawal of a plea both before conviction, and on appeal and the following have been cited here:

        The substantial general proposition which emerges from these cases is that it is a matter for the discretion of the judge presiding as to whether a plea of guilty should be permitted to be withdrawn and that each case must be looked at in regard to its own facts and a decision made where justice requires that that course be taken. 
        
       
       
        
        It is clear that in the case of mistake or other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt the court should readily grant leave. But if the plea has been entered in full knowledge of all the facts and intentionally as a plea to the charge which is made, the court is plainly entitled to exercise its discretion against a withdrawal of the plea. The law regards a plea of guilty made by a person in possession of all the facts and intending to plead guilty as an admission of all the legal ingredients of the offence ( 
        O’Neill 
         [1979] 2 NSWLR 582; 1 A Crim R 59) and as the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made, for the court is prepared to act upon it and proceed to conviction or final disposal of the proceedings.” 
        
       
       
      
    34    In R. v. Murphy  (1965) VR 187 to which Lee J referred in R. v. Sagiv, Sholl J. in part of a passage which was approved by this Court in R. v. Chiron, to which Lee J also referred, said  supra at 190-191: 
     
      
       
        
        “Most of the reported cases can,, it is true, be fitted into the principles formulated in  
        R. v. Forde 
         [1923] 2 KB 400; [1923] All ER Rep 477. But they should not be regarded as exhaustive of all possible cases of miscarriage of justice. They not cover, for example, a case where an accused person, against whom a prima facie case exists, but who denies and has never admitted his guilt, is induced by threats, e.g. of a fellow accused, or of a police officer, to plead guilty where otherwise he would have pleaded not guilty. In such a case there would, in my opinion, be a miscarriage of justice, unless perhaps the case against him were overwhelming, and there should be a new trial.  
        
       
       
        
        In the present instance, the applicant’s case is that she pleaded guilty because of considerations irrelevant to the actual question of her guilt or innocence, and that she is in fact not guilty. Mr. Neesham, in his admirable address on her behalf, put it that it would be sufficient if the question of her guilt or innocence was an issuable matter. I should be disposed to agree that if she pleaded guilty through a misapprehension of the law e.g. a misunderstanding of what she was pleading to, or what constituted the crime charged, or for some other reason which enabled one to say that her plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt, an issuable question of guilt would be sufficient to warrant the ordering of a new trial.” 
        
       
       
      Later, having considered the evidence, his Honour concluded  
       supra at 191 
      : 
       
       
        
        “If I thought she was probably innocent, and that she pleaded guilty without reference to any consciousness of guilt, but because of a muddled idea that she would thereby keep the child, I should consider her conviction a miscarriage of justice such as this Court should correct by ordering a retrial.  
        
       
       
        
        But after a careful examination of the depositions and the exhibits and a full consideration of her evidence before this Court I am not satisfied that she did not plead guilty partly if not wholly through a consciousness of guilt. The documentary evidence points very strongly to her guilt. It is not a case, therefore, where a miscarriage of justice has been shown. Rather, it seems to me, much the most probable explanation of her plea of guilty is that it was entered into in the belief that by that course she would minimise as far as practicable the punishment for offences she knew she had committed.” 
        
       
       
      
    35    In seeking to support his submission that there had been a miscarriage of justice, Mr. Craddock relied, first, upon the matters deposed to by the Appellant in his Affidavit and the evidence given by the Appellant on the hearing of the appeal, and, second, on the passage in the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in England in R. v. Turner  supra  to which I have earlier referred. That passage in the Judgment of the Court delivered by Lord Parker CJ, so far as is relevant, was as follows  supra at 326-327: 
     
      
       
        
        “Before leaving this case, which has brought out into the open the vexed question of so called ‘plea bargaining’, the court will like to make some observations which may be of help to judges and to counsel and, indeed, solicitors. They are these: 
        
       
       
        
        1. Counsel must be completely free to do what is his duty, namely to give the accused the best advice he can and if need be advice in strong terms. This will often include advice that a plea of guilty, showing an element of remorse, is a mitigating factor which may well enable the court to give a lesser sentence than would otherwise be the case. Counsel of course will emphasise that the accused must not plead guilty unless he has committed the acts constituting the offence charged. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The accused having considered counsel’s advice, must have a complete freedom of choice whether to plead guilty.  
        
       
       
       ……… 
       
       
        
        4. The judge should, subject to the one exception referred to hereafter, never indicate the sentence which he is minded to impose. A statement that on a plea of guilty he would impose one sentence but that on a conviction following a plea of not guilty he would impose a severer sentence is one which should never be made. This could be taken to be undue pressure on the accused thus depriving him of that complete freedom of choice which is essential …” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    36    Although the observation made by McGuire DCJ as to what would occur if the trial were to proceed and the Appellant were to be found guilty may, in the light of the observations of Lord Parker CJ, be regarded as having been unfortunate, I am not persuaded that the Appellant - who bears the onus of doing so - has demonstrated that there has been a miscarriage of justice as the result of the Appellant’s plea of guilty having been entered following undue pressure and not because it represented a genuine consciousness of guilt. The passage from the evidence given by the Appellant to the Royal Commission which I have set out above (para. 21 (3)) makes it, in my view, clear that, even before the matter was raised with Judge McGuire in open court following the luncheon adjournment, the Appellant appreciated to the full, first, that if the trial were to proceed there was a very real risk that the jury would find him guilty; and, second, that, if the trial did proceed and he were found guilty by the jury, the probability was that he would receive a full time custodial sentence. The same passage from the evidence given by the Appellant to the Royal Commission also makes clear that before he entered his plea of guilty, it had been explained to him - one assumes, by Mr. Bellamy - that such a plea represented an acknowledgment by him that the heroin which was said to have been found on him was his; and, second, that, having weighed up the various matters to which he had referred in his evidence, he nonetheless decided he would enter a plea of guilty. In these circumstances, it seems to me that the entry of that plea ought not to be regarded as something which had been induced as the result of undue pressure but rather ought to be regarded as a voluntary act on the part of the Appellant. 
     
      
    37    Nor would I regard what has been put forward as fresh evidence as justifying granting the Appellant leave to withdraw his plea and upholding the appeal. In this regard, I note the following: 
     
      
       
      1. as will be apparent from what I have earlier recorded, the evidence which Mr. and Mrs. Laird, Ms. McCorriston and Mr. O’Sullivan were able to give was not only known to the Appellant prior to the hearing before McGuire DCJ but had been given on the hearing before Urquhart DCJ and was available to be given if the hearing before McGuire DCJ had in fact continued; 
       
       
      2. in any event, what I have earlier recorded demonstrates the evidence of those four persons, while dealing with some of the events which occurred on 23 June 1992, did not deal with the search said to have been conducted by Det. Ison and Det. Richardson or what was said to be the finding by Det. Ison of the heroin; 
       
       
      3. the Report of the Royal Commission would appear to indicate that the allegations made by the witnesses Manning, GDU2, Munro and Puntigam concerning Det. Ison were all denied by Det. Ison;  
       
       
      4. although the allegations made by the witness GDU2 in the evidence given by him to the Royal Commission tended to implicate Det. Richardson in two of the matters alleged by GDU2 against Det. Ison, it would appear that, in a statement made to the Independent Commission Against Corruption in January 1993 in relation to the allegations made by him concerning Det. Ison, he made no reference to Det. Richardson being present at the time and that he did not make any suggestion of impropriety on the part of Det. Richardson; 
       
       
      5. whatever may have been the allegations against Det. Sgt. McClelland or Det. Sgt. Eade made in the course of evidence given to the Royal Commission, the fact is, as I have earlier recorded, that neither Det. Sgt. McClelland nor Det. Sgt. Eade was said to have been present at the time of the search of the Appellant and his car carried out by Det. Ison and Det. Richardson on 23 June 1992. 
       
       
      6. even if the allegations subsequently made to the Royal Commission by the witnesses Manning, GDU2, Munro and Puntigam had been known to the Appellant at the time of the hearing before McGuire DCJ, the certainty is that those allegations, if put to Det. Ison and Det. Richardson in the course of cross-examination, would have been denied by them and it would not have been open to the Appellant to tender the evidence of those witnesses to counter that denial. 
       
      
    38    Even if the allegations made by the witnesses Manning, GDU2, Munro and Puntigam could be regarded as fresh evidence which, following the verdict of a jury brought in at the end of a fully contested trial, might justify the upholding of an appeal from that verdict and the making of an order for a new trial, in the present case it was not the absence of that evidence but the Appellant’s plea of guilty which led to the jury verdict and the conviction and sentence imposed by McGuire DCJ. 
     
      
    39    As we have heard full argument on the matter, I would propose that leave to appeal out of time be granted. However, as I am not persuaded that there has been a miscarriage of justice, I would propose that the appeal be dismissed, the conviction and sentence confirmed. 
     
      
       
      
    40    HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Powell JA and with His Honour’s Reasons. I wish however to add some remarks of my own. 
     
      
    41    Even if I were persuaded that the Appellant’s plea of guilty was entered otherwise than through a consciousness of guilt, it does not follow that the appeal should be allowed and the Appellant permitted to withdraw his plea. 
     
      
    42    For justice to the community would require that, if that course was followed, the Appellant be re-tried on the charge brought. But it is now 6 years since the Appellant’s plea and 8 years since the events which led to him being charged. Whether all, or indeed the main, witnesses are still available is unknown but even if they are, it is certain that memories will have dimmed appreciably over the intervening period. A trial now is thus likely to be a significantly different event from one conducted in 1994 and it is a moot point whether justice could be done. 
     
      
    43    Of course trials relating to events 8 or more years ago are by no means unheard of. However, in this case the reason for the delay will have been the actions of the Appellant consciously engaged in for the benefits he saw himself likely to derive from the course he adopted. 
     
      
    44    Unless one can conclude that justice to the community can still be done, it is strongly arguable that in the circumstances of this case he should be allowed to suffer the consequences of his decision. 
     
      
       
      
    45    DOWD J: I have read in draft form the judgment which has been prepared by Powell JA and agree to the proposed orders and reasons therefor.

A court cannot be required to try an issue which is incompatible with the law as current and applicable at a relevant time. - - Per Adams J (dissenting): At trial the Crown evidence should be limited to the assertions of conduct within the span of its specification. To permit otherwise would render the trial inevitably unfair. The nature of indecency in the context of sexual assault discussed. Comment upon the notion of equal justice with particular reference to gender. The reflection of community standards in legislation and otherwise and the perception of abuse of process considered. - - Per Smart AJ: An applicant for permanent stay of proceedings should be required to verify his position. This did not occur. The assertion that sexual activity took place a year later than alleged but at a time when such activity was unlawful does not provide foundation for exercise of discretion to order permanent stay of proceedings.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
      
    1   GROVE J : This is an appeal pursuant to s5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act challenging an order made on 18 November 1999 by Shillington DCJ permanently staying proceedings on an indictment against the respondent charging him with six counts of indecently assaulting a male person and two counts of buggery. Four of the indecent assault counts and one buggery count were charged to have occurred between 19 December 1979 and 30 June 1980 and the other offences between 1 November 1980 and 18 December 1980.  
    2   The complainant named in all counts was the same person. He had been born on 19 December 1962 and therefore attained the age of eighteen years on the day after the latest date of any offence specified in the indictment. 
    3   In June 1984 significant changes in relevant law were effected by legislation and thereafter acts of sexual intimacy including buggery, between consenting adults (i.e. those over eighteen years of age) ceased to be punishable offences.  
    4   At the hearing below the learned trial judge was informed that the respondent would not deny that he and the complainant had engaged in sexual acts but would assert that the first of these occurred in 1981. His Honour was further told that, if the matter proceeded to trial, the issue, apart from the anticipated to be acknowledged acts, would be whether the complainant was under or over the age of eighteen when those acts occurred. The prosecutor accepted that if the complainant was not under that age, there should be verdicts of not guilty. The motion for stay was dealt with on the basis of this information as common ground between the Crown and the respondent. I will need to return to aspects of these matters but it is convenient first to deal with the appeal in terms of the contest as accepted by the parties. 
    5   Since 1987 the complainant has resided outside of Australia. He returned to give evidence at committal proceedings in May 1999. He testified that he had met the respondent at a club in Oxford Street Darlinghurst named Pedros. He later amended his evidence to nominate another club named Patches. He recalled that he was sixteen years of age at the time. Later he became aware that the respondent was operating a pinball parlour in Wollongong named Flashback. He came to frequent it. The respondent offered him a job supplying change for and performing minor repairs to the machines. He thought he started this employment in March 1980. Shortly after he commenced that work he was invited to spend a weekend at a farm (Tara) owned by the respondent. He accepted. He gave evidence of sexual activity there and on a holiday which they took to Airlie Beach in Queensland. Any activity in Queensland is outside of jurisdiction of New South Wales courts but the complainant recollected that the holiday took place in the winter or spring and it would be significant to establish whether he was referring to the seasons of 1980 or 1981.  
    6   It can be mentioned that cross examination of the complainant included exploration of the firmness of his memory for dates. He said that he returned to Australia for Christmas 1995 but agreed that it could possibly have been 1996. He was not sure when he last had sexual contact with the respondent and testified that it could have been 1983 or 1984, or any time up to 1987 when he left the country. 
    7   There was no evidence called by the prosecution which was corroborative of the complainant’s testimony. There were however a number of matters to which he referred which were potentially supportive of his version of the span of time in which the offences were alleged to have occurred. 
    8   The complainant said he was driven to Tara in a silver Alfa Romeo motor car; the respondent owned such a car but both the car and the property were owned during 1981 as well as 1980. A restaurant in Wollongong was in operation during both those years. The complainant remembered it as the venue of a celebration of his eighteenth birthday arranged by the respondent, prior to which there had been acts of sexual intimacy between them. Flashback Pinball Parlour was in operation over both the years mentioned. None of these references is definitive of date, save the birthday which does not of itself demonstrate whether events preceded or followed it. 
    9   The case of the respondent for a stay of proceedings was substantially based upon the impossibility of his now obtaining objective material which would verify his contention that the relevant events occurred in 1981. Counsel referred to the handicaps derived from the extreme delay between alleged offence and the charging and the unavailability of potential sources such as bank records and the like. It suffices however to refer to two matters adverted to by the learned trial judge. 
    10   The owner of Flashback was the Village Roadshow Corporation. His Honour found that employment records for 1980 and 1981 were no longer available. Similarly there were no longer available airline passenger manifests or accommodation details at the Queensland resort hotel which could demonstrate when the holiday was taken by the complainant and the respondent.  
    11   It is well established that a permanent stay should not be granted simply because witnesses or evidentiary material have become unavailable or lost: R v Adler unreported CCA 11 June 1992; R v Goldberg unreported CCA 23 February 1993; R v McCarthy unreported CCA 12 August 1994; R v Tolmie unreported CCA 7 December 1994; R v Hatfield [1999] NSWCCA 340.  
    12   Every case must nevertheless be determined in the context of its own facts and there is undoubted jurisdiction to stay proceedings to prevent unfair trial. Although the jurisdiction involves the exercise of discretion, the circumstances will usually have to be extreme for such relief to be given; Jago v District Court of New South Wales 1989 168 CLR 23; The Queen v Glennon 1992 173 CLR 592; R v Tolmie supra. 
    13   Were the employment or accommodation records or the passenger manifests accessible, it is reasonable to conclude that they would be determinative of the issue joined between the prosecution and the respondent - did the acts charged occur in 1980 or 1981? I am conscious that this does not exactly recite the dates in the indictment but it is a broadly convenient statement of the substantial issue. 
    14   The situation is to be distinguished from those where records simply might be of assistance to an accused. Of course, in this case the records may determine the issue in favour of the prosecutor but there is nothing to suggest that the chances are other than equal, either way. 
    15   Shillington DCJ concluded that there was no way in which a jury could be adequately instructed so as to avoid unfairness in the conduct of the trial. It was submitted by the Crown that it would suffice to draw the attention of the jury to the disadvantage suffered by the accused as a result of delay and consequent absence of corroborative record and to caution them to take this into account as a restraining influence against conviction. Such a direction would not adequately focus attention upon the essence of the issue namely whether there is a reasonable possibility that the records, if available, would determine the contested issue in favour of the accused. In the present circumstances, that question would have to be answered in the affirmative. The perception of unfairness is not altered by the necessity of a similar affirmative answer to the congruent question whether there is a reasonable possibility that such records would determine the contested issue in favour of the prosecution.  
    16   Subject to the next matter with which I will deal, it is not demonstrated that Shillington DCJ acted on a wrong principle, allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, has mistaken facts or has not taken into account some material consideration and his exercise of discretion on the issue presented for his decision was untainted: House v The King 1936 55 CLR 499.  
    17   I return to considerations concerning the agreed issue. The Court was informed, as was Shillington DCJ, that there was a policy of prosecution authorities in effect which was to refrain from charging offences of the type now under consideration occurring before June 1984 where, by reason of the ages of the participants, the activity had ceased to constitute an offence after that date. The concession that, if the complainant was not under the age of eighteen when the activity took place, he should be found not guilty apparently derived from it.  
    18   The Court raised the question whether the District Court was being asked to try a false issue in respect of the offences charged and the time spans particularized in the indictment. The law making punishable acts such as buggery, irrespective of the age of participants, was current and applicable in both 1980 and 1981. A trial judge could not direct a jury that, if a complainant had turned eighteen, an accused was not guilty of such offence. The implementation of policy cannot alter the law. Undoubtedly prosecutorial discretion may be exercised to refrain from charging in accordance with some adopted policy but once a matter is brought before a court it must be determined according to applicable law which, I repeat, could not involve acquittal of an offence of relevant type committed at any time before June 1984 simply because of the attainment of age by the participants.  
    19   The avoidance of potential trial of a false issue became dependent upon the dates specified in the various counts of the indictment being treated as having made time the essence of offence in each case. This would not ordinarily be so. In R v Dossi 1918 13 Cr.App R 158. Atkin J (as he then was) observed: 
     
      
       
       “From time immemorial a date specified in an indictment has never been a material matter unless it was actually an essential part of the alleged offence …….” 
       
      
    20   Although it is usual to insert the date or dates between which offences alleged to have been committed, time has been stated to be of the essence in four situations, namely: 
     
      
     (i) when an act is criminal only when done within a certain time of some other act or event; 
      
      
     (ii) when it is an essential ingredient of a particular offence that certain consequences should follow a particular act; 
      
      
     (iii) when it is an essential ingredient of a particular offence that the act alleged was committed between certain hours of the day or night; and 
      
      
     (iv) when the prosecution for a particular offence must be commenced within a certain time of the commission of the criminal act alleged.  
      
      
     See  
     Halsburys Laws of England 
      4th Edn Vol 11 para 207 n4. The present case is in none of those categories. 
      
    21   Can a prosecutor make time of the essence of offence simply by pleading and submitting to being bound by the time which has been pleaded? In my opinion, a prosecutor cannot. The present matter can be used as an example. Suppose the matter went to trial, I have already observed that the judge could not charge the jury contrary to law that the accused would be not guilty of offence if punishable activity occurred on or after 19 December 1980 (and, of course, before June 1984). Indeed, even if the jury expressly found that an offence occurred after that date (assuming proof of other ingredients) conviction would be inevitable. The circumstances of Dossi were almost parallel. Dossi was charged with indecent assault on March 19 and the jury announced “with regard to the date March 19, not guilty, but if the indictment covers other dates guilty”. The trial judge amended the date to read “on some day in March” but this was unnecessary. If a specified date were regarded as a defect in the indictment, it would in any event cured by verdict, its substance being that of an inessential averment.  
    22   It may be contemplated that in a particular case, the conduct of the trial and the content of evidence will lead a presiding judge to direct a jury that a Crown case is only made out if an offence occurred on some specific occasion or within an evidenced span of time. There has been no trial. The issue which has arisen is whether an immaterial averment can be made material by pleading. 
    23   The exclusive issue before this court is an appeal against an interlocutory order, the effect of which was to prevent any trial taking place at all. The evidence and the concessions made in the court below were directed to seeking that order for stay of proceedings and I would not embark upon analysis of other issues which may be hypothesized to arise upon the indictment until they can be discerned as having emerged in the context of evidence at trial. 
    24   My conclusion is that it was not open to the prosecutor, with or without the consent of the respondent, to limit the issues presented for trial upon indictment and the indictment is required to be tried by the Court according to the law in force and not in accordance with a selective restriction placed upon it by a party.  
    25   I emphasize that it is obvious that the conduct of the proceedings below and in this Court has been bona fide and that the matter now in focus was not adverted to until raised by the Court. I would add that nothing which I have stated affects the prosecutorial discretion to refrain from charging in any given case and the ambit of my opinion is confined to cases where the trial process has been invoked. As may be inferred from the foregoing, argument by the Crown on the merits was unsuccessful in the District Court and I would not uphold the appeal against that decision other than on the basis that I have elaborated. The presentation of the Crown appeal was not initially directed to that basis and a decision whether to continue proceedings remains within the scope of prosecution discretion. 
    26   The consequence of the finding of error is that the appeal must be allowed. 
    27   I propose that the appeal be allowed and the order permanently staying the presentation of indictment be quashed.28   ADAMS J: I have read the judgment of Grove J in draft and do not need to repeat here his Honour’s account of the material circumstances.  
    29   The dates of the alleged offences as specified in the indictment, however, need to be stated. The complainant turned eighteen on 19 December 1980. The first five counts (four of indecent assault and one of buggery) in the indictment are alleged to have occurred between 19 December 1979 and 30 June 1980. The complainant’s statement makes it clear that the first allegedly occurred in March 1980, well into his seventeenth year. The three remaining counts (two of indecent assault and one of buggery) allegedly occurred between 1 November 1980 and 18 December 1980, the last allegedly one week before the complainant’s eighteenth birthday. The complainant’s statement unambiguously dates these events as occurring before his eighteenth birthday. The sexual acts allegedly committed here were in every relevant sense consented to and there is no suggestion, let alone evidence, that the complainant was anything other than a voluntary participant in them. The account of the first occasion commences in the following way - 
     
      
       
       “...I hopped in the shower. A few minutes later Rod came in and he was naked with a towel over his shoulder and asked if he could come in and I said, ‘Sure’...He got in and got wet and got a flannel and started washing me down...Then he started sucking my penis for a few minutes. Then I sucked his. We got out of the shower and went to his bedroom...We started making out, kissing, fondling.” 
       
      
    30   The conclusion of the learned District Court Judge was that certain crucial records were no longer available. His Honour relied in that regard upon evidence that had been adduced in the committal proceedings, the fact that the Crown was unable to produce any records of the kind nominated and the implicit concession by the Crown prosecutor in argument before his Honour that the records were, indeed, not available. The argument before this Court proceeded upon the explicit concession by the Crown prosecutor made in written submissions that the material records “no longer exist” and no point was taken that the findings below were incorrect. I am of the view that the learned District Court judge was not in error in his factual conclusions. It would be most unfair to determine the appeal against the respondent, who has not had an opportunity to submit otherwise in this Court, on the basis that those factual conclusions, conceded by the Crown to be correct, were unjustified.  
    31   Nor do I consider that, to provide a factual basis for his application for a stay in the circumstances of this case, the accused should have given evidence that no sexual activity occurred between the complainant and the appellant in 1980. The Crown did not advance a submission to this effect either in this Court or at first instance. The hearing and this appeal have proceeded upon the basis that this is, indeed, the defence case. With respect, I think that it would, again, be unfair to the respondent for this point to raised for the first time at this juncture. 
    32   Grove J has concluded that subject to the time element in the indictment, no appealable error was demonstrated in the reasons or order given below. For the reasons Grove J has given, I agree that, on the assumption that the time limits expressed in the indictment were essential to be proved, the orders below were not in error. Moreover, in my view, if this matter went to trial, it would be essential that the trial judge direct the jury that the accused must be acquitted if it is not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt unlawful sexual activity occurred before 18 December 1980.  
    33   If the indictment in this case (say, for buggery) did not specify either place or time, it is clear that the accused would have been entitled to require the Crown to particularise the occasion in question. The Crown alleges that the accused committed two such crimes on the particular occasions specified by the complainant, to which the counts in the indictment refer and which occurred, according to the indictment, between 19 December 1979 and 30 June 1980 and between 1 November 1980 and 18 December 1980. The question has arisen whether, even if the jury were satisfied that those occasions did not occur, if it were nevertheless satisfied that buggery occurred on other occasions after the specified dates (presumably, on the basis that the complainant was mistaken, despite his categorical assertions to the contrary) the accused could be convicted of those particular crimes. As the matter has come before us, the Crown does not allege that any such occasions occurred. 
    34   For the sake of explaining the terms of the indictment, the prosecutor both below and in this Court indicated that, as a result of the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1984 (the Amendment Act, which commenced on 8 June 1984) the Crown proposed to charge and call evidence only as to events alleged to have occurred prior to the complainant’s 18th birthday. The function of the dates in the present indictment, therefore, is deliberately to identify particular alleged acts which constitute the relevant crimes and to exclude all other occasions on which similar acts may have occurred constituting other crimes. The complainant’s evidence would be, if asked, that he and the respondent had a sexual relationship that continued for some years. Smart AJ considers that the dates in the indictment were not relevant for reasons other than identifying the incidents in question, such as establishing alibi or casting doubt upon the happening of the events. However, the defence case is that the respondent and the complainant had not met on the dates in question: in every relevant sense this raises alibi and doubts about the happening of the events. There is no relevant difference, in principle, between time and place: they are both merely the coordinates identifying an occasion.  
    35   As I understand it, the majority view is that, if the jury thought that the complainant was merely mistaken about dates but considered, nevertheless, that the offences described in the indictment occurred, then, even if the accused established irrefutably that he had not met the complainant on the dates alleged, they might nevertheless convict. That is to say, the jury might convict the accused if they were satisfied that the offences occurred at any time before repeal of the offence. If this is so, it follows that the indictment might be validly framed alleging the offences occurred at any time between 18 December 1980 and 7 June 1984 and the Crown could not be required to particularise any date in that period or, if it did, would not be bound by it. By parity of reasoning, the same position would arise as to place. Accordingly, the Crown would be entitled to prove any acts of indecency or anal intercourse, limited only by the number of charges in the indictment, that occurred within those dates in New South Wales and the accused would have to establish that he never had committed any such acts. This cannot be right. The trial could not possibly be fair. It follows that, if the respondent established his alibi for the period before 18 December 1980 or the jury was in doubt about it, he must be acquitted on the present indictment. 
    36   This is not a case where the indictment falls to be considered in the abstract, in which event it would be correct to say, of the buggery charges but not (for the reasons stated below) of the indecent assault charges, that the dates were not essential elements of the charges in the sense mentioned by Grove J, in particular because a time prescription was not part of the offence itself. Their essential character arises from the case as particularised by the Crown. In this sense the indictment resembles the information that was considered in Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467 and must, in my view, be considered in light of the case particularised. 
    37   To my mind, the circumstances here are significantly different from those in R v Dossi (1918) 13 Cr App R 158. In that case, a particular act on a particular occasion was charged in the indictment although the jury found, as it happened, that it occurred on a date different to that which was alleged. The Court of Criminal Appeal held that the conviction was nevertheless proper and that the date was immaterial. Here, however, the Crown wishes to try the accused for behaviour occurring on a particular occasion falling within specified dates and has eschewed any desire to prosecute him for any other crimes that may have occurred on other dates. This is not a case where one occasion is alleged but there is uncertainty as to its date. 
    38   In Regina v VHP (unreported, NSWCCA 7 July 1997), the complainant alleged that the offence had occurred on a particular date, although the indictment had specified a range of dates. The Court accepted that the jury could not have been satisfied that the offence occurred on the date specified by the complainant but the trial judge had given an equivocal direction which may have led them to think that they could nevertheless convict the appellant if they thought the offence had occurred within the range of dates specified in the indictment. Gleeson CJ (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) analysed the evidence to ascertain whether the complainant actually was professing the degree of certainty attributed to him and said (at 15) - 
     
      
       
       “As a general rule, what the Crown needs to establish in order to obtain a conviction are the essential facts alleged in the indictment, and if the Crown fails to establish an inessential fact, or a particular which has been provided before the trial, or which emerged from the evidence of Crown witnesses, that is not fatal. However, that generalisation may, in any given case, need to be qualified. Two examples of possible qualifications are of present relevance. First, in some circumstances the requirements of procedural or substantive fairness may restrict the capacity of the Crown to depart from particulars. Second, the evidence in a case may be such that it would not be open to a jury, acting reasonably, to treat one part of the Crown case as reliable, and another part as unreliable.” 
        
       
      
     His Honour referred to the general rule as stated in Atkin J in  
     R v Dossi 
      (1918) 13 Cr App R 158 at 159-160, as cited by Grove J, but then went to say - 
      
      
       
       “There are, however, many examples of cases in which it has been held that time has been made of the essence of the offence, or, to use another expression adopted by judges, has been made vital, by reason of circumstances which give rise to qualifications of the kind mentioned above [citing, amongst other cases,  
       The King v Dean 
        [1932] NZLR 753 and  
       R v Pfitzner 
        (1976) 15 SASR 171].” 
       
      
    39   It seems to me that, if the proper conclusion was that the complainant’s evidence was as specific as was claimed in the trial, accepted by the trial judge and conceded by the Crown prosecutor on appeal, the Court would have unhesitatingly upheld the appeal upon the ground that that date was vital. The Chief Justice pointed out that, although the Court was not bound by the Crown prosecutor’s concession, it should be accepted and acted upon because it was carefully considered, involved considerations of fairness to the accused, related to evidence at first instance, in the assessment of which the Court was at something of a disadvantage, and seemed to accord more with the trial judge’s appreciation of the situation than the alternative view. It was not suggested that the Crown was not bound, at the least, by the dates specified in the indictment. 
    40   As I have said, if the dates here were regarded as immaterial, the respondent here would at least be entitled to know the particular occasions upon which he was being faced with an allegation of a criminal act. This case has been argued by both sides upon the assumption that over a number of years, on the Crown case before as well as after, and on the defence case only after, 18 December 1980, there were a number of occasions of sexual acts capable at the time of comprising criminal offences. So far as the complainant is concerned, it may be assumed that he would give evidence, if asked, of sexual acts performed between the accused and himself not only before but also after 18 December 1980. In the committal proceedings he gave evidence, which exhibited some uncertainty, that he and the respondent visited each other and had sexual relations with varying frequency until 1982 (when, it seems, the complainant “was going out with someone else”) or, perhaps, 1987. However, such evidence would not be admissible (for irrelevance) in this trial since it would also be the complainant’s evidence, and the Crown case, that those acts were additional to the crimes charged in the indictment. 
    41   As the indictment presently stands, if the dates are immaterial, it would be impossible to tell whether acts said by the complainant to have occurred in 1981 or later were the acts alleged in the indictment. Accordingly, although each count in the indictment charged one offence only (as is essential in law: see Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467), the evidence would reveal a multiplicity of offences with insufficient particulars to identify any one of them as the offence with which the accused was charged in any particular count. In R v S (1989) 45 A Crim R 221, Dawson J said (at 226-7) - 
     
      
       
       “As I have said, the three counts in the indictment were framed in a permissible way. Each charged only one offence and gave rise to no duplicity. Had the evidence revealed only one offence in each of the years in question, there could have been no complaint about the form of the indictment. But the evidence disclosed a number of offences during each of those years, any one of which fell within the description of the relevant count. Because of this, there was what has been called a ‘latent ambiguity’, in each of the counts: see  
       Johnson v Miller 
        (1937) 59 CLR 467 per Dixon J (at 486). That ambiguity required correction if the applicant was to have a fair trial.  
       
      
      
       
       “The material before us does not reveal whether the ambiguity was apparent by reference to the depositions at the time that the applicant made the application for particulars. If it was, it may have been appropriate for the trial judge to have ordered that particulars be given identifying the events as charged, if not by reference to time, by reference to other distinguishing features. If at that stage, such a course was inappropriate and it was necessary for the prosecution to call its evidence for the precise nature of the defect in the proceedings to emerge, the prosecution ought to have been required as soon as the defect became apparent to elect by indicating which of the offences revealed by the evidence were the offences charged.” 
       
      
      
     It follows that, one way or another, the offences charged must be particularised since otherwise the particular occasions cannot be identified to the extent essential to enable a fair trial of the accused.  
      
    42   The Crown case here is that the crimes alleged occurred prior to 18 December 1980. If the trial were permitted to proceed, the accused by his plea would join issue as to whether those, and only those, crimes occurred or not. In the circumstances of this case, if the jury were satisfied that sexual acts otherwise within the description contained in the relevant counts of the indictment occurred, but after 18 December 1980, it would follow that those acts were not those with which the accused was charged and, accordingly, to which he had not pleaded and upon which they could not return verdicts one way or the other. In my opinion, the only verdict which they could give, if they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the crime alleged occurred between the dates specified in the indictment, is to return a verdict of not guilty. 
    43   In R v Pfitzner (1976) 15 SASR 171, Bray CJ said (at 185) - 
     
      
       
       “Whether the date alleged in an information is vital to the charge must depend on the circumstances. So long as it is clear that the controversy turns on the events of a certain occasion, it may not matter if the date of that occasion is misstated if the occasion itself is clearly identified and both parties have directed their cases towards it: cf  
       Page v Butcher 
        [1957] SASR 165. But obviously if a man is charged with committing an offence on Saturday and comes prepared with an alibi for Saturday, he cannot be convicted of committing the offence on Friday or Sunday, unless perhaps the information is amended and the trial adjourned to enable him to meet the new case. If authority is needed for so obvious a proposition, it will be found in  
       Wright v Nicholson 
        [1970] 1 WLR 142; [1970] 1 All ER 12; (1970) 54 Cr App R 38.” 
        
         
       
      
    44   In this case, the accused’s defence, as foreshadowed, is that he had not met the complainant prior to 18 December 1980. To take count one by way of example, it is consistent with this defence that the accused did have anal intercourse with the complainant on the first occasion that the complainant went to the accused’s farm at Kangaroo Valley, if, and only if, that occurred after 18 December 1980, so that, if the occasion identified by the Crown is defined without reference to dates, the accused may have no defence. However, the Crown has chosen not to allege and will not seek to prove that the accused committed anal intercourse with the complainant on the first occasion that the complainant visited him at his farm at any time but only if that event occurred prior to 18 December 1980, indeed between 19 December 1979 and 30 June 1980.  
    45   There have been many cases in which it has been held in this Court that the conduct by the Crown of its case has made the time specified by the complainant in evidence an element of the offence in the particular circumstances: see, for example, in addition to Regina v VHP (unreported NSWCCA 7 July 1997), Regina v Cox [1999] NSWCCA 62, Regina v Hughes [2000] NSWCCA 3. In those cases, there was some uncertainty as to when the occasions giving rise to the offences occurred but the trials proceeded upon the basis that one or more particular dates identified the occasions charged. They were not cases where the legal elements of the crime prescribed any particular time frame. Here, there is no uncertainty about time. The Crown case is, following in this respect the complainant’s expected evidence, that the offences occurred after his seventeenth and before his eighteenth birthday. The conduct by the Crown which, it has been held, renders the dates alleged in the charge an essential item of proof, is not confined, in my view, to those cases where the dates crystallise during the course of evidence: the prosecution case may be so conducted from the beginning. 
    46   In The King v Dean (1932) NZLR 753, the accused was charged with unlawfully carnally knowing a girl under sixteen in an indictment containing five counts each of which charged the commission of an offence “on or about” a specific date. The prosecutrix, who was the only witness as to the dates of the offences, in respect of three of them, possibly all, swore positively that they were committed on the specific dates mentioned in the indictment. The defence was an alibi in each case. The jury was directed that proof of the exact dates was not material and that proof that the offences occurred within a reasonable time of the dates mentioned in the indictments was sufficient, relying on R v Dossi (supra). Myer CJ considered that there was “a very important distinction” between Dossi and the instant case, noting that the prosecutrix in the case under appeal, alleged specific dates in the evidence and specific alibis were relied on by the accused. His Honour went on to say (at 761) - 
     
      
       
       “It is to be observed, however, that the girl did not speak of any acts of intercourse - I refer particularly to January - except on the specific dates to which she swore. If she had said that intercourse had taken place a great many times during January and in the neighbourhood of the specific dates mentioned, and, under proper direction, the jury had found a verdict of ‘Guilty’, the observations in  
       R. v. Dossi 
        (1) might apply; but where a girl swears positively that an offence was committed on a specific date, and only on that date, if the prisoner is able to establish an alibi as to that date to the satisfaction of the jury, then, unless, at all events, it is shown that the girl has made a mistake in fixing the date, I do not see how a direction that the jury may convict the prisoner of an offence on another date can be justified. All that Mr Justice Atkin says in  
       R. v. Dossi 
        (1) is that a date specified in an indictment has never been a material matter unless it is actually an essential part of the alleged offence. True, the date specified  
       in the indictment  
       is not material, but if it is sworn to that the alleged offence took place on a specific date and there is no evidence that other offences took place in the neighbourhood of that date it seems to me that the date sworn to does become essential. In other words, it is the date proved that is material, not the date specified in the indictment.” 
       
      
      
     The other judges of the court, Ostler, Reed, Adams, and Smith JJ, said (at 763) - 
      
      
       
       “In this case the dates specified in the indictment in the last three counts had become an essential part of the offences charged therein. The times had been made of the essence of the offences by the evidence. Where a female makes a criminal sexual charge against a male, but cannot recall the exact date of the alleged offence, although a date should be specified in the indictment, and although it is the duty of the Crown to ascertain and state that date as exactly as possible, then the rule applies, and (if the charge is laid within nine months) the exact date is not an essential part of the offence, even though the exact date has been specified in the indictment. But whether the charge in such an indictment is laid on an exact date or ‘on or about’ a date, where the whole of the evidence is that the offence was committed on that date and on no other, then the date has been made an essential part of the offence. If an alibi on that particular date is set up in defence, it is a misdirection for the presiding Judge to inform the jury that they may accept the alibi and yet convict. The proper direction to the jury is that they cannot convict unless they reject the alibi as being false or mistaken. If that were not the law, then an innocent man, who relying on the exact date sworn to the prosecutrix, and brought evidence proving beyond all doubt that he was elsewhere on that date would be liable to be convicted notwithstanding such proof, and although deprived of the opportunity of proving an alibi on any other date on which the jury might be invited to hold that the offence was committed.”  
       
      
    47   It seems to me that this case is in all essential respects comparable to that in Dean. The specific evidence to be adduced by the Crown prosecutor from the witness is limited to acts alleged to have occurred between the dates specified in the indictment. It would be entirely inadmissible, in my view, for the prosecutor to lead evidence of sexual behaviour which occurred outside those dates either in the Crown case or in cross-examination of the respondent, should he give evidence. Accordingly, at the end of the day, the jury would be left with a prosecution case confined to the period before 18 December 1980, with no evidence of other sexual acts covered by the counts in the indictment and, if the accused had proved he had not met the complainant until he was eighteen, or this was reasonably possible on the evidence, an acquittal would be inevitable. The occasion for a direction that the jury could regard the dates specified in the indictment as immaterial would not arise, since no evidence raising the possibility that the offences occurred other than when the complainant asserted was the fact would have been adduced.  
    48   A direction that the dates in the indictment were immaterial would be wrong, in my opinion, not only for the same reasons as those expressed in Dean, but because the jury would then be invited to have regard to any offences fitting the description in the indictment occurring at any time. The direction, even if it allowed consideration of occasions not falling within the dates in the indictment must specify some temporal limit or other. This is implicit in all the cases to which I have referred, even Dossi. If the accused had given evidence confined to his not meeting the complainant until 1981, he could not be asked about any events that occurred after 17 December 1980 and, if asked about matters that might tend to incriminate him in respect of that time, could refuse to answer. There would, therefore, be no evidentiary basis for fixing any limit on the possible dates of an offence, though 8 June 1984, the date of repeal of the offences, would provide a legal limit.  
    49   There is another substantial practical difficulty facing the Director of Public Prosecutions in the conduct of a trial in this case in which the dates specified in the indictment were not vital, having regard to the decision of this Court that the lapse of time combined with the significant prejudice to the accused in establishing that he had no relationship with the complainant prior to 18 December 1980 rendered unfair a trial of offences alleged to have occurred before that date. It necessarily follows that it would be unfair for the Crown to seek to put forward the case that the accused did indeed have illicit sexual relations with the complainant before then. The trial, accordingly, must be confined to the issue whether the unlawful acts occurred after 18 December 1980. It would obviously be proper, indeed, necessary, for the indictment to be changed to reflect that case. The consequence would be that the Director would be prosecuting an offence which, for good policy reasons, he did not wish to prosecute. That indictment is not the present indictment. This Court has not been asked to consider an indictment in any form in which such different dates are specified.  
    50   The Crown here has declined to amend the indictment to identify other dates and an indictment without dates must be particularised for the reasons I have already mentioned. A refusal to do so must result in quashing the indictment in accordance with Johnson v Miller (supra) and R v S (supra). Thus, whether the proceedings be stayed or the indictment be quashed, a trial cannot be conducted of the indictment in its present form. 
    51   There are other matters of significance which also lead to the conclusion that this Court should not allow the present appeal. 
    52   Section 79 of the Crimes Act 1900 (the Act) as it stood in 1981, when the complainant was aged eighteen and hence an adult, was in the following form - 
     
      
       
       “Whosoever commits the abominable crime of buggery, or bestiality, with mankind, or with any animal, shall be liable to penal servitude for fourteen years.”  
       
      
      
     The form of the indictment in Archbold’s  
     Criminal Pleading &c 
      for many years up to and including the 21st edition (1910) was as follows - 
      
      
       
       “The jurors for our lady the Queen upon their oath present, that JS …in and upon one JN feloniously did make an assault, and then feloniously, wickedly, and against the order of nature, had a venereal affair with the said JN, and then feloniously carnally knew him the said JN, and then feloniously wickedly and against the order of nature with the said JN did commit and perpetrate that detestable and abominable crime of buggery (not to be named among Christians); against the form of the statute &c.”  
       
      
      
     This certainly captured the spirit, if it did not confine itself to the letter, of the law. By 1956 the English provision omitted the invective “abominable” (see s12,  
     Sexual Offences Act 
      1956), although the 36th edition of Archbold (1966), the last before the offence was repealed in 1967, described the offence in the text as “horrible” (see para 2969).  
      
      
     Subject to the application of s 61N and s 61O of the Act (discussed below), consensual sexual relations in private between adults not in a relevant familial relationship have not been crimes in this State since the enactment of the  
     Amendment Act 
     . Section 79, as it stood before 8 June 1984, prohibited anal intercourse not only between males but also by a man with a woman, consent being no defence, age being irrelevant and both parties being equally guilty: see, for example, Hamilton & Addison  
     Criminal Law & Procedure 
      6th edition (1956), citing  
     R v McDonald 
      1 SCRNS 173. (This view merely repeated the textbooks and is not controversial.) Section 78K, which superseded the old s 79, created an offence of homosexual intercourse between males, one of whom is less than eighteen years of age. Consent is irrelevant. 
      
    53   The appellant is also charged with offences under s 81 of the Act as it stood in 1980. Section 81, before its repeal in 1984, provided - 
     
      
       
       “Whosoever commits an indecent assault upon a male person of whatever age, with or without the consent of such person, shall be liable to penal servitude for five years.” 
       
      
      
     It is clear that, although the indecent assault may be committed by a woman, it must have been against the will of the male:  
     R v Mason 
      (1969) Cr App R 12, where it was held that an adult woman who had frequent consensual intercourse with boys aged fourteen or fifteen, did not commit any indecent assault because, although consent was not a defence, there was no act which occurred against their will.  
     R 
       
     v Hare 
      [1934] 1 KB 354, where a woman who induced a boy under sixteen years of age to have sexual intercourse with her, and who contracted gonorrhoea, was convicted of the offence, was distinguished as having dealt only with the question whether a woman could commit the offence. The position of girls was different. In  
     R v McCormack 
      (1969) 2 QB 442, the Court of Appeal held that a man who inserted his finger into the vagina of a girl aged fifteen years, who fully consented, was guilty of indecent assault, however willing she was.  
     Mason  
     ( 
     supra 
     ) was cited in argument but not referred to in the judgment. That the indecent assault had to be contrary to the will of the other, where the parties were male was decided in  
     R v Wollaston 
      [1872] 12 CCC 180, even where, being minors, the victims could not consent; see also,  
     Beal v Kelley 
      (1951) Cr App R 128).  
      
    54   So far as men are concerned, in New South Wales, the word “assault” has no more significance than “act” since it is not necessary for the prosecution, in order to prove the offence, to show that there was any element of compulsion, threat or hostility on the part of the accused. In R v B & L (1954) 71 WN (NSW) 138, which involved two adult men, discovered in flagrante delicto by police torchlight at night under some bushes in a park, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that any indecent “association between...males”, even following upon mutual agreement, is prohibited by the section. Though the “association” was arguably in a public place, this was not said to be relevant. The English cases were distinguished on the ground that the English legislation did not specifically state that the “assault” was nevertheless a crime “with or without consent” even though the judgments dealt with precisely that issue under the common law. It must be conceded that it is difficult to discern the relevant difference between an act that is against the will and one to which consent cannot legally be given. However, the New South Wales refusal to give the word “assault” (after all, a legal term) its long standing meaning, which must have been well known to the legislature, seems even more tortured. 
    55   Section 80A was inserted into the Act, in 1955. It made it an offence for a male to commit, or be party, either privately or publicly, to the commission of, an indecent act with another male of any age or procure or attempt to procure any such commission and providing a maximum penalty of two years. There was no reference to assault. This section was also repealed in 1984. Prosecutions of adults under these provisions not infrequently resulted in substantial gaol sentences. 
    56   The test of indecency has been variously stated as whether the behaviour was unbecoming or offensive to common propriety (Harkin (1989) 38 A Crim R 296) or an affront to modesty (Crowe v Graham (1968) 121 CLR 375; [1968] ALR 524) or would offend the ordinary modesty of the average person (Moloney v Mercer [1971] 2 NSWLR 207). In R v Manson and anor (unreported NSWCCA 1993) Gleeson CJ said - 
     
      
       
       “An indecent act is one which right-minded persons would consider to be contrary to community standards of decency. In [ 
       Purves v Inglis 
        (1915) 34 NZLR 1051 at 1053]… the following was said: ‘The word indecent has no definite legal meaning and it must be taken therefore in its modern and popular affectation. In the Standard Dictionary indecent is defined to be anything that is unbecoming or offensive to common propriety.’ If, as in the present case [a photograph said to have been taken for political purposes of a naked eleven year old girl], the act in question has an unequivocally sexual connotation the Crown does not have to prove that the act was done for the purposes of providing sexual gratification. On the other hand, the purpose for which an act is done may well be regarded by right-minded people as relevant to the question whether it is decent or indecent, depending upon the circumstances of the particular case. The fact that an act was done for artistic or political purposes may lead a jury to conclude that it was not indecent. On the other hand, it would certainly not require such a conclusion.” 
       
      
    57   Accordingly, if the language of s 81 was given its ordinary meaning, all sexual behaviour committed on an adult male whether by a male or female was capable, in law, of being criminal even if by mutual agreement, depending what might be thought to constitute community standards. In respect of women, however, prosecutions were confined to sexual behaviour with boys. Whilst there is no rule of law that sexual acts in private between adult males must be legally indecent, this is assumed to be so. Conversely, it is assumed that sexual acts between men and women in private are not relevantly indecent. The section does not, in terms, make any such distinction but, of course, it has never been either understood or applied according to its ordinary meaning. The different assumptions applying to homosexual and heterosexual relations demonstrate the homophobic considerations which were implicit in the law as interpreted in this State. It is, perhaps, ironic that, so far as persons over the age of sixteen years were concerned, only sexual relations between women, if consensual, could not be criminal even if they offended community standards.  
    58   The potential reach of s 81 of the Act was limited by the implicit assumptions which I have mentioned. If enforced according to its terms, it could not have long survived. It did so only because it was taken to apply only to sexual acts committed on children, sexual acts which were not consented to and, of course, homosexuals. In the first and second cases, prosecution was justified by the reasonable requirement of protection but in the third case the only reason was prejudice.  
    59   Section 81 of the Act was superseded, in part, by s 78Q which created the offence of “gross indecency” committed by a male person with or towards another male person who is under the age of eighteen years but provided a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment. Section 61N(2) of the Act makes it a crime punishable by up to eighteen months imprisonment where any person commits or incites an “act of indecency” with or towards another aged sixteen years or more. Thus, even now, adults who, for example, consensually masturbate in each other’s presence in private commit a crime if “right minded” persons might consider their behaviour to be contrary to accepted community standards (to accept the formulation in Manson, supra): Saraswati v The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 1. This provision might well comprehend consensual adult lesbian sexual behaviour, although it is virtually impossible to suppose that it would be prosecuted. Section 61O(1A) and (3)(a), of the Act have the combined effect of increasing the penalty for this behaviour to three years where more than two persons are involved. Different provisions apply to victims who are under the authority of the offender or have a serious physical or intellectual disability.  
    60   Amongst the changes to the Act brought about by the Amendment Act, consensual sexual relations with persons under the age of sixteen years became criminal offences whether the person committing the acts is male or female. However, if both the parties are male, those acts are nevertheless a crime (subject, where the acts fall short of anal or oral intercourse, to the meaning of “gross indecency”, as to which, see below) where one or other of them is sixteen years old but has not reached the age of eighteen years.  
    61   This treatment by the criminal law of sexual behaviour has been criticised as discriminatory upon the basis that it is apparently acceptable that a boy over the age of sixteen may have consensual sexual relations with a woman (even if a teacher), however induced, but must be protected from sexual intercourse with any man. Moreover, consensual sexual relations by a male with a sixteen or seventeen year old female are not criminal (unless, she being sixteen, he is a teacher, father or step-father: s 73 and subject to the application of s 61N and s 61O discussed above) but, if done with a male of the same age, is always criminal. This exposes the irrelevance of the argument (which is, at all events, tendentious) that males between sixteen and eighteen are less relevantly mature than females of that age. If it is thought that such males do not need the protection of the criminal law from females, what is the basis for thinking that they need protection from males? What is really being said here is that, even where a male aged sixteen or seventeen is induced or seduced to undertake sexual behaviour, then, if he consents in law, he suffers no harm if the other person is female but only if the other person be male. Indeed, such is the prejudice that, if the other party is female, many would regard the male as fortunate and as having proved his manhood. Even where he is subjected to sexual behaviour at the instance of a woman who is in authority, no criminal offence is committed. If it be appropriate to punish by the criminal law consensual sexual relations procured improperly by adults on persons aged sixteen or seventeen years, the circumstances of the impropriety can and should be specified clearly and should not distinguish between males and females. (See the Report of the Royal Commission into the Police Service (1997) by the Hon Justice JRT Wood AO, especially Vol V, Ch 14 which, if I may say so with respect, is comprehensive and persuasive.) 
    62   By s 66C of the Act, sexual intercourse with a child aged between ten and sixteen years (where the offender is not in a position of authority) is punishable by up to eight years imprisonment. Having regard to the provisions of s 78Q, however, this does not, it seems, apply where both persons involved are male and anal or oral intercourse occurs. Where that is the case, the maximum penalty is increased by two years to ten years.  
    63   If the indecency of a sexual act varies according to what a “right-minded” person might consider is the relevant community standard, the issue arises whether the admittedly consensual sexual behaviour (not being anal intercourse) alleged in the present case is criminal under s 81 (or for that matter, s 81A) of the Act. Drawing the distinction made by Gleeson CJ in Manson (cited above), the questions requiring determination are whether it is capable of being indecent and, if so, whether, in fact, it was.  
    64   The old authorities, such as R v B & L, supra, which simply assumed but did not decide that the element of indecency was established merely by evidence of sexual acts in private between males (without the elements of minority or lack of consent) cannot, in my opinion, still be regarded as expressing the law. Nor, in my view, did they correctly express the law in 1980.   
    65   The textbooks, such as Watson & Purnell, Criminal Law in New South Wales (1970, Law Book Co Ltd) do not advert to sexual acts committed by a female upon an adult male.  
    66   In Potter v Minahan (1908) 7 CLR 277, the notorious dictation test (said by the Attorney General of New South Wales to have been designed primarily to preserve “white” Australia from “Asiatics”: R v Wilson; Ex parte Kisch (1934) 52 CLR 234 at 239) was used to exclude the appellant who was born in Australia of a Chinese father, from returning from abroad. O’Connor J quoted with approval the following passage from Maxwell of Statutes, 4th ed, p 121 - 
     
      
       
       “It is in the last degree improbable that the legislature would overthrow fundamental principles, infringe rights, or depart from the general system of the law, without expressing its intention with irresistible clearness; and to give any such effect to general words, simply because they have that meaning in their widest, or usual, or natural sense, would be to give them a meaning in which they were not really used.” 
       
      
    67   I have not been able to find a case (and I very much doubt that there is one) in which the question whether there is a different standard of decency for homosexuals or heterosexuals has been considered. Since the precise question is devoid of authority and those decisions which assume that homosexual relations are ipso facto indecent predate by a considerable margin the developments of both community standards and the law concerning discrimination, (of which, in New South Wales, the exemplar may be the Anti-Discrimination Act 1975), I consider that the interpretation of s 81, so far as it might literally apply to consensual adult homosexual relations in private, should be reconsidered and determined by reference to first principles.   
    68   In my opinion, the decency or otherwise of homosexual relations cannot, in law, be any different from those of heterosexual relations. Any such distinction necessarily depends upon arbitrary and capricious considerations which could not be accepted unless the legislation explicitly required it. Moreover, the distinction offends the fundamental principle that all citizens are equal in sight of the law and is an arbitrary interference with privacy. Since consensual heterosexual relations between adults have never been and cannot be relevantly indecent, it follows that consensual homosexual relations between adults cannot be indecent within the meaning of s 81 of the Act.  
    69   In R v Suckling [1999] NSWCCA 36, this Court considered the application of R v Swaffield and Pavic (1997-98) 151 ALR 98 where the High Court of Australia applied a community standards test to the admissibility of evidence obtained by subterfuge. The Court pointed out - 
     
      
       
       “that the reference by the High Court, as by this Court, to community standards in this respect is not to any notion of populist public opinion. Rather, this refers to community standards concerning the maintenance of the rule of law in a liberal democracy, the elements of the proper administration of justice and the due requirements of law enforcement.” 
       
      
    70   The meaning of community standards, in any particular legal context, is a question of law; whether the application to the circumstances of a particular case produces a particular result may be regarded as a matter of fact. Community standards in this context are not the same as popular opinion or vulgar prejudice: they are the expression of standards that reflect the fundamental values of our society so far as the application of the criminal law is concerned, including, as particularly relevant here, the principle of equality before the law or equal justice. 
    71   In Siganto v The Queen (1998) 159 ALR 94, at 105, Gaudron J described the principle of equal justice as of “fundamental importance”, in referring to one of its consequences, namely, parity in sentencing. The requirement of consistency in punishment was said by Mason J in Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610 to be “a reflection of the notion of equal justice”. In Leeth v The Commonwealth of Australia (1992) 174 CLR 455, Deane and Toohey JJ said (at 485-6, 487) - 
     
      
       
       “The doctrine of legal equality is in the forefront of ...[every fundamental constitutional doctrine existing and fully recognized at the time the Constitution was passed]. It has two distinct but related aspects. The first is the subjection of all persons to the law...The second involves the underlying or inherent theoretical equality of all persons under the law and before the courts. (See, eg, Holdsworth,  
       A History of English Law 
        (1938) vol 10 p 649.) The common law may discriminate between individuals by reference to relevant differences and distinctions, such as infancy or incapacity, or by reason of the conduct which it proscribes, punishes or penalizes. It may have failed adequately to acknowledge or address the fact that, in some circumstances, theoretical equality under the law sustains rather than alleviates the practical reality of social and economic equality. Nonetheless, and putting to one side the position of the Crown and some past anomalies, notably, discriminatory treatment of women, the essential or underlying theoretical equality of all persons under the law and before courts is and has been a fundamental and generally beneficial doctrine of the common law and a basic precept of the administration of justice under our system of government... 
       
      
      
       
       “At the heart of...[the obligation of a court to act judicially] is the duty of a court to extend to the parties before it equal justice, that is to say, to treat them fairly and impartially as equals before the law and to refrain from discrimination on irrelevant or irrational grounds.”  
       
      
      
     Gaudron J said (at 502) - 
     
     
      
       
       “All are equal before the law. And the concept of equal justice- a concept which requires the like treatment of like persons in like circumstances, but also requires that genuine differences be treated as such - is fundamental to the judicial process.” 
       
      
      
     Their Honours dissented on the constitutionality of s 4(1) of the  
     Commonwealth Prisoners Act 
      1967 (Cth), and it may be doubted whether the doctrine of equality can be found in the Constitution. However, we are not here dealing with a constitutional question but, primarily, with the nature of community standards.  
      
    72   In Kruger & ors v The Commonwealth (1997) 146 ALR 126 (at 157-8), Dawson J (with whom McHugh J agreed on this point) disagreed with the views expressed in the passages above cited, concluding that the “common law...provides no foundation for a doctrine of ...substantive equality”. Toohey J emphatically restated his earlier view (146 ALR at 179-182). Gaudron J also adhered to her earlier view, but pointed out that “there is a limited constitutional guarantee of equality before the courts, not an immunity from discriminatory laws” (146 ALR at 194). It is implicit in her Honour’s judgment, however, that laws will not be given a discriminatory effect unless this is required expressly or by necessary implication. Gummow J considered that there was no Constitutional doctrine of general equality (146 ALR at 227) and said that “caution is required in dealing with what was said by nineteenth century English legal writers as to equality of persons under or before the law” but it seems to me that his Honour’s observation was aimed at statements of suggested constitutional significance (146 ALR at 228). Brennan CJ did not express an opinion whether there was a general common law doctrine of equality. 
    73   It seems to me that the doctrine of equal justice, in the sense in which I refer to it, is a fundamental element of the rule of law, if not as a substantive right, then as necessarily informing the content and application of the common law, including the rules applying to the interpretation of statutes. At the very least, it would require quite explicit legislative language to qualify its otherwise appropriate application. In citing the principle of equality, I do not mean to do more than to note its importance as a fundamental element of community standards, though it may have a wider significance. The use by s 81 of the Act of the notion of indecency as an essential element of the crime for which it provides, demonstrates the potential for change over time in the applicability of the provision to particular behaviour. It follows that, in principle, no case such as R v B & L can have as its ratio decidendi a determination that adult homosexual behaviour is ipso facto indecent. Thus, the conventional assumptions current when R v B & L was decided cannot be regarded as authoritative at a later time.  
    74   In Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 293, Brennan J said (at 318) - 
     
      
      “I do not doubt that the Courts of this country, and especially this Court as the ultimate court of appeal, acting within their respective jurisdictions and in response to the exigencies of particular cases, create new rules of the common law. The common law has been created by the Courts and the genius of the common law system consists in the ability of the Courts to mould the law to correspond with the contemporary values of society. Had the Courts not kept the common law in serviceable condition throughout the centuries of its development, its rules would now be regarded as remnants of history which had escaped the shipwreck of time (adaptation from Francis Bacon,  
      The Advancement of Learning 
      , (1605), Bk 2, fol.10b). In modern times, the function of the Courts in developing the common law has been freely acknowledged (see, for example,  
      Myers v Director of Public Prosecutions 
       (1965) AC 1001, per Lord Reid at 1021;  
      Mutual Life and Citizens' Assurance Co Ltd v Evatt 
       (1968) 122 CLR 556, per Barwick C.J. at 563;  
      Geelong Harbour Trust Commissioners v Gibbs Bright and Co  
      (1974) AC 810, per Lord Diplock at 820-821). The reluctance of the Courts in earlier times to acknowledge that function was due in part to the theory that it was the exclusive function of the Legislature to keep the law in a serviceable state. But Legislatures have disappointed the theorists and the Courts have been left with a substantial part of the responsibility for keeping the law in a serviceable state, a function which calls for consideration of the contemporary values of the community. Where a common law rule requires some expansion or modification in order to operate more fairly or efficiently, this Court will modify the rule provided no injustice is done thereby (as in  
      L Shaddock and Associates Pty Ltd v Parramatta City Council (No 1) 
       (1981) 150 CLR 225, or  
      Hawkins v. Clayton 
       (1988) 164 CLR 539 or  
      David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia 
       (unreported, 7 October 1992). And, in those exceptional cases where a rule of the common law produces a manifest injustice, this Court will change the rule so as to avoid perpetuating the injustice (as in  
      Mabo v Queensland 
       (1992) 66 ALJR 408; 107 ALR 1). 
       
       
      “The contemporary values which justify judicial development of the law are not the transient notions which emerge in reaction to a particular event or which are inspired by a publicity campaign conducted by an interest group. They are the relatively permanent values of the Australian community.” 
      
    75   In Jago v Judges of District Court of NSW (1988) 12 NSWLR 558, Kirby P thought that “a relevant source of guidance in the statement of the common law of this State maybe the modern statements of human rights found in international instruments, prepared by experts, adopted by organs of the United nations, ratified by Australia and now part of international law” (12 NSWLR at 569; see also Dietrich, supra, per Mason CJ and McHugh JJ, Brennan J, who said that Art 14(3)(d) of the International Covenant On Civil and Political Rights “is a legitimate influence on the development of the common law”, and Toohey J at 177 CLR at 306, 321, 360; and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh (1995) 183 CLR 273 at 287, 315). To adapt his Honour’s elaboration of this point, such statements must be at least as relevant to a search for the content of contemporary community standards as to the possible inherent indecency of homosexual relations, as the unexamined social assumptions of judges who were born and largely bred in the nineteenth century and before.  
    76   Articles 1, 2, 7, and 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) respectively state (in part): “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and human rights”; “Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex...”; “All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law...”; “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy...nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation”. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966, adopted by Australia 1976) refers in its preamble to “the inherent dignity and...equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family” and notes the undertakings by the Parties “to guarantee that the rights enunciated by the Covenant will be exercised without discrimination of any kind” (Art 2), ensure the equal rights of men and women (Art 3), and subject rights provided by the State “only to such limitations as are determined by law only in so far as this may be compatible with the nature of those rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society”; see also the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966, adopted by Australia 1980), especially the preamble, referring to the “inherent dignity” of all persons, Art 2, excluding discrimination, Art 3, requiring equality between men and women, Art 17, prohibiting arbitrary interference with privacy (and see below), Art 22, requiring freedom of association and forbidding restrictions unless (inter alia) to protect public morals, and Art 26 declaring that all persons are equal before the law and prohibiting discrimination on any ground such as sex or other status. Although there is no reference, in terms, to discrimination by the criminal law against homosexuals, I consider that it is clear that a law which distinguished between the heterosexual and homosexual behaviour of adults for the purpose of visiting punitive consequences on the latter is contrary to the principles enunciated in these instruments, a fortiori when the content of community standards is being considered in the application of such a law in the context of a repeal of legislation that permitted such consequences and its replacement by legislation that applied only to minors. 
    77   In Rodney Croome & anor v Tasmania (1997) 191 CLR 119, the applicants sought declarations that ss 122 and 123 of the Criminal Code (Tasmania) were inconsistent with s 4 of the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act 1994 (the Commonwealth Act) which provided - 
     
      
       
       “Arbitrary interferences with privacy 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (1) Sexual conduct involving only consenting adults acting in private is not to be subject, by or under any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, to any arbitrary interference with privacy within the meaning of Article 17 of the  
         International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
         . 
         
        
       
      
      
        
       
        
         
         (2) For the purposes of this section, an adult is a person who is 18 years old or more.” 
         
        
       
      
      
     Article 17 of the Covenant provides - 
      
      
       
       “1 No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. 
        
         
        
       “2 Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.” 
        
       
      
    78   Section 122 of the Code made sodomy a criminal offence, whilst s 123 punished any male who, whether in public or private, committed an indecent assault upon or other act of gross indecency with another male. The High Court dismissed the application of the State of Tasmania to set aside the writ, holding that the applicants had standing to seek the declarations although there was no pending or likely prosecution. It was not sought to be argued that the Commonwealth legislation had no possible application to the offences in question. It was a necessary assumption of the decision that it did so. Section 81 of the Act applies even if the relevant acts occurred in private. The Commonwealth Act does not directly make the relevant behaviour lawful. It prohibits the privacy of sexual conduct involving only consenting adults from being subjected to arbitrary interference.  
    79   Because the possibility of a trial for conduct falling within the Commonwealth Act arises only if the jury might be invited to convict the respondent even if it had a reasonable doubt that the alleged indecent assaults occurred prior to December 1980, and both parties submitted to the contrary, the applicability of the Commonwealth Act was not raised in argument before us. There was no occasion, therefore, for notice under s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 to be given. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me to express more than a tentative view about the application of the Commonwealth Act in the present circumstances. However, because this legislation is relevant apart from its effect under s 109 of the Constitution, it is necessary, in my opinion, to consider the nature and applicability of its provisions. 
    80   Prima facie, the prohibition or punishment of private sexual conduct involving consenting adults and no other rationally relevant feature demonstrating culpability, for example, incestuous relations, contravenes s 4 of the Commonwealth Act. In so far as s 30 of the Interpretation Act 1987 is concerned, which is the essential foundation for the continuing effect of ss 79 and 81 of the Act, I think that it may well be inconsistent to that extent with the Commonwealth Act. (Sections 8 and 8A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) are irrelevant to a consideration of any possible continuing liability as they deal only with the effects of repeal of a Commonwealth Act; the Commonwealth Act does not repeal in any sense State legislation: it prevails by virtue of s 109 of the Constitution.) The language of s 4 is particularly apt to a trial concerning the relevant conduct. This is especially so having regard to its obvious remedial purpose. At all events, it is clearly directed to effect the reform it embodies so far as all relevant sexual conduct which might be the subject of proceedings is concerned, whenever that sexual conduct occurred. The Commonwealth Act is not aimed at the conduct of the person but at the exercise by the state of its powers of coercion under the criminal law and prohibits any such action occurring after its commencement. In this case, at least, the preferring of a charge in respect of the relevant conduct and the conduct of a trial would seem to be forbidden, subject to the meaning that should be attributed to “arbitrary”. (For reasons that are apparent in this judgment, I consider that the prosecution of sexual behaviour involving adult men that is not criminal if performed by women or heterosexuals is arbitrary in the sense that it expresses mere capricious prejudice.) So viewed, the Commonwealth Act would not be applied retrospectively. However, even if this interpretation might be considered to apply the Act retrospectively, in my opinion, having regard to the explicit and peremptory language of the Commonwealth Act and its manifest purpose, this is immaterial.  
    81   At the very least, the Commonwealth Act is a most significant matter to be taken into account in determining the content, in law, of the community standard implicit in the element of indecency required to prove an offence under s 81 of the Act. 
     
      
       
      
    82   In my view, there is now no distinction, for the purposes of the criminal law, between the concept of indecency as it may be found in heterosexual and homosexual behaviour. That standard must, as it seems to me, apply in the instant trial, if there were to be one, even though the conduct in question here occurred in 1981. It would be strange, to say the least, if the Courts are obliged to apply outdated and offensive notions which have been repudiated because of their conflict with fundamental human rights and the appropriate scope of the criminal law (unless, of course, they are bound to do so by specific and unambiguous legislative mandate) merely because the allegations concerned acts which occurred twenty years ago when (so the argument goes) those notions may have been current. Just as inappropriate would be a direction that invited a jury to consider, not their views of contemporary standards, but their understanding of community standards as they stood in 1981.  
    83   These considerations, which are both theoretical and practical, persuade me that it is inappropriate to inquire into the character of community standards as they stood in 1980 or 1981. After all, s 81 was repealed in June 1984, only shortly after the events in issue here and the new offence applied only to minors, where the criminal behaviour was required to be grossly, as distinct from simply, indecent. At all events, although community attitudes have no doubt evolved over the ensuing twenty years, I would not accept that they significantly differ from those of the present day. The result is that, rightly interpreted, neither s 81 nor s 89A of the Act applied in 1981 to consensual homosexual relations between adults in private.  
    84   It follows that the dates in the indictment, so far as they are referred to in counts one, two, four, five, six and seven, are essential elements of the offence since, if the acts alleged occurred when the complainant was an adult, they cannot amount in law to the crime of indecent assault as provided in s 81 of the Act. Accordingly, so far as the appeal concerns the alleged offences under s 81, it must be dismissed. Independently of this ground, if the Commonwealth Act applies in the present circumstances (as I am inclined to think, although do not determine, that it does) a trial of alleged offences under either s 79 or s 81 of the Act cannot proceed in respect of conduct that occurred when the complainant was an adult. 
    85   It is arguable that the terms of s 78K of the Act, in limiting criminality to “gross indecency” as distinct from indecency simpliciter, indicate a legislative view that some acts of a sexual character, even if committed by a male with a male of sixteen or seventeen years, are not criminal. This would be analogous, so far as those acts were concerned, to the situation affecting females. However, as s 78K is not directly in issue in these proceedings, it is unnecessary to determine this question. For reasons which I consider later, it is my view, however, that the repeal of s 79 and s 81 and the enactment of s 78K and s 79Q in their place is also significant for the disposal of this appeal. 
    86   If the above interpretation is incorrect and it be accepted that the indictment is not limited to events occurring before 1981, there is an alternative basis upon which, in the circumstances, the trial should be stayed. This ground applies equally to the charges under both s 79 and s 81 of the Act. In substance, such a trial would be an abuse of process. It is fundamental to this point that the nature of the provisions with which the respondent is charged be appropriately characterised.  
    87   Sections 79 (unless qualified as above indicated) and 81 of the Act, so far as they apply to consensual homosexual acts between adults in private, constitute a gross interference by the State in the personal liberty of a minority of its citizens. In this respect, they are not essentially different from laws prohibiting miscegenation. Those laws were motivated by racial prejudice, this law by sexual prejudice. It is impossible now to maintain, and it could not have been rationally maintained at any material time, that it was proper, let alone right, for the State to prohibit or punish homosexual relations in private between adults.  
    88   Section 79 of the Act reveals, in its own terms, its essential character. No other crime, not even murder or rape, as appalling as they are, has ever in New South Wales been described as “abominable”. The term, however, is applied to behaviour which includes consenting sexual relations in private between adult men. The indictment in the present case follows the language of the section and charges the respondent with the “abominable crime of buggery”. This is the conventional form. It has been conventional for far too long. “Abominable”, being surplusage, is not part of the necessary description of the offence. It is mere abuse. It places the thumb of prejudice on the scales of justice.  
    89   There is an important question here, although it is, perhaps, a departure from conventional judicial practice to point it out. One is driven to ask how indictments in such terms could have been preferred in our courts, in modern times, without remark or protest, let alone objection, not only from the bar but from the Bench. Indeed, I have sat in this Court and referred without reflection or concern to language of this kind. It is no answer that such acts, when committed on children or without consent, are abominable. So are many other crimes that are not so described. That is not the matter to which the term refers. It is a characterisation of the particular culpability of homosexual relations. This institutional sanctioning of abuse is part of a pattern of social attitudes, aimed at homosexuals but demeaning the values of the law itself. 
    90   The law, in its application to consenting adults, was and is irrational and cruel. It conflicts with basic human rights. Sections 79 and 81 of the Act were unjust when they, or their equivalents, were first enacted and are no less unjust today.  
    91   It has been held by this Court that s 79 still applies to enable prosecutions to be mounted at the present time against persons who had sexual relations prior to the 1984 amendments and who could not now be prosecuted if those acts occurred after the amendments. In R v Pritchard (1999) 107 A Crim R 88, the complainants were, in the main, resident postulants or novitiates doing training before taking their vows, at a high school of which the appellant was principal. One of them was nineteen years old at the time of the anal intercourse committed (prior to 1984) by the appellant in respect of which he was charged under s 79 of the Act. Its repeal was held to be immaterial in the circumstances upon the basis that, at all events, the homosexual intercourse had not been consented to. The Court was of the view that s 55(2) of the Interpretation Act 1987 (since repealed by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 1999 and replaced in the by s 19 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, with unchanged language; for convenience, I shall continue to refer to s 55), which applies where a penalty is reduced after commission of an offence but before sentence, is irrelevant where the offence is repealed. Grove J said (107 A Crim R at 93) that he could “perceive force in the argument that if...the circumstances demonstrated a consensual act unaccompanied by any matter of aggravation, abolition of the criminal sanction might be categorised as extreme reduction of penalty and even if s 55 [of the Interpretation Act 1987] be not directly applicable, parity of reasoning from cases like Hartikainan (unreported, NSWCCA 8 June 1993) could result in nominal punishment being appropriate.” His Honour did not elaborate on what was meant by “a matter of aggravation” for this purpose. Abadee J, however, considered (107 A Crim R at 95) that even “an act between two ready and willing [semble, adult] males” reflected only “perhaps criminal culpability of at lower level” (emphasis added) but that where the exercise of authority “secured the participation of the other” (though, as I understand his Honour, nevertheless with consent) this reflected a higher degree of culpability. His Honour was, implicitly at least, of the view that, where the conduct “represented a gross breach of trust”, it would be criminally reprehensible even though consented to. Barr J agreed with Abadee J.  
    92   With unfeigned respect I consider that, unless the material acts were not consented to in the sense that this requirement is used in the law concerning other sexual assaults, no sexual acts between adults, even if liable to prosecution under the repealed ss 79 and 81 of the Act, could, since the enactment of the Amendment Act properly be punished, even though, if Pritchard be right, s 30 of the Interpretation Act 1970 preserves the offence and its penalty as a matter of statutory interpretation. Although both the trial in Pritchard and the appeal were decided well after the commencement of the application of the Commonwealth Act, no reference was made to the legislation either in argument or the judgments of the Court. If the views I expressed above concerning the Commonwealth Act be correct, there were three possible bases for quashing the conviction which were not considered. To this extent, the correctness of Pritchard comes into question.  
    93   In Regina v Hartikainan (unreported NSWCCA 8 June 1993), the Court considered the effect of an increase in the maximum sentence provided by s 61I of the Act. Gleeson CJ (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) said that the action of the Parliament “must be taken by the courts to have reflected community standards” and concluded, “It is incumbent upon the courts to give effect to the concerns manifested by Parliament”. There can be no more emphatic declaration by the Parliament of its concerns than the repeal of an offence and the enactment of a new offence omitting the criminality earlier provided, in this case, consenting sexual relations between adult males. In substance, the repeal of s 79 and s 80 of the Act, so far as they relate to homosexual activity between adults is not only the abolition of the crime (from the date of repeal) but a reduction of the penalty to zero. I note that Smart AJ posits in this case the possibility that the Court might impose a “nominal” penalty or, indeed, not enter a conviction at all under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing) Procedure Act 1999.  
    94   If I were not bound by authority, I would hold that the repeal of a criminal offence such as that which occurred here, would be caught by s 30 of the Interpretation Act 1987 only to the extent to which, in substance, its elements were continued by a new or substituted provision. I think that it is obvious that the draftsperson of s 30 did not consider its possible application to legislative changes of the kind operative here and I do not think that, taking the clear intention of Parliament as expressed by both s 30 and s 55, it was intended to continue the effect of either s 79 or s 81of the Act past the date of its repeal. However, in light of Pritchard, this argument cannot be applied to dispose of the present case, so far as conducting a trial is concerned. 
    95   Since, as I have said, the Court in Pritchard acted upon the basis that the victim had not consented to the anal sexual intercourse committed upon him, the observations concerning the effect of the repeal of s 79, so far as it concerned consensual anal intercourse, are obiter dicta. If, for the reasons adverted to by Grove J, a trial of the respondent on charges arising from events prior to 18 December 1980 would be unfair, the Director of Public Prosecutions is limited, in effect, to proving consensual homosexual acts that occurred when the complainant was an adult. If he is convicted, the respondent might be subjected to more than merely a nominal punishment if the sentencing judge (as I think, in error) took the view that the acts in question, to apply Grove J’s observation in Pritchard “were not unaccompanied by any matter of aggravation” or, accepting the view of Abadee and Barr JJ, should be punished “at a lower level”, even if he could not have been tried, let alone punished, under s 78K or s 78Q of the Act had the acts occurred after June 1984. This demonstrates the essential injustice of proceeding against the respondent for any consensual sexual acts which occurred after the complainant’s eighteenth birthday. On my view of the matter, only nominal punishment could, at the highest, be imposed in the event of conviction.  
    96   In Walton v Gardiner (1992-1993) 177 CLR 378 Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ, said (at 392-3) - 
     
      
       
       “The inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to stay its proceedings on grounds of abuse of process extends to all those categories of cases in which the processes and procedures of the court, which exist to administer justice with fairness and impartiality, may be converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness...The jurisdiction of a superior court in such a case was correctly described by Lord Diplock in  
       Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police 
        [1982] AC 529 at 536 as ‘the inherent power which any court of justice must possess to prevent misuse of its procedure in a way which, although not inconsistent with the literal application of its procedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to litigation before it, or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people’.”  
       
      
    97   In a passage that has been cited with approval in the High Court of Australia (eg Jago v District Court (NSW) (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 30; Williams v Spautz (1991-1992) 174 CLR 509 at 520), Richardson J of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Moevao v Department of Labour [1980] 1 NZLR 464 said (at 58) - 
     
      
       
       “It is not the purpose of the criminal law to punish the guilty at all costs. It is not that that end may justify whatever means may have been adopted. There are two related aspects of the public interest which bear on this. The first is that the public interest in the due administration of justice necessarily extends to ensuring that the Court's processes are used fairly by State and citizen alike. And the due administration of justice is a continuous process, not confined to the determination of the particular case. It follows that in exercising its inherent jurisdiction the Court is protecting its ability to function as a Court of law in the future as in the case before it. This leads on to the second aspect of the public interest which is in the maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice. It is contrary to the public interest to allow that confidence to be eroded by a concern that the Court's processes may lend themselves to oppression and injustice.” 
       
      
    98   In Jago (supra) Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ expressed a wide view of what might constitute an abuse of process. They did not confine that principle in a narrow, traditional way. Mason CJ said (168 CLR at 28) -  
     
      
       
       “The question is not whether the prosecution should have been brought, but whether the court, whose function is to dispense justice with impartiality and fairness both to the parties and to the community which it serves, should permit its processes to be employed in a manner which gives rise to unfairness.”  
       
      
    99   The Chief Justice (at 29) stated that there was no reason why the right to a fair trial should not extend to the whole course of the criminal process. Brennan J said (at 47-8) - 
     
      
       
       “An abuse of process occurs when the process of the court is put in motion for a purpose which, in the eye of the law, it is not intended to serve. The purpose of criminal proceedings, generally speaking, is to hear and determine finally whether the accused has engaged in conduct which amounts to an offence and, on that account,  
       is deserving of punishment 
       . When criminal process is used only for that purpose and is capable of serving that purpose, there is no abuse of process. Although it is not possible to state exhaustively all the categories of abuse of process, it will generally be found in the use of criminal process inconsistently with some aspect of its true purpose, whether relating to the hearing and determination, its finality, the reason for examining the accused’s conduct...When process is abused, the unfairness against which a litigant is entitled to protection is his subjection to process which is not intended to serve or which is not capable of serving its true purpose.” (Emphasis added.) 
       
      
    100   The jurisdiction to permanently stay a criminal proceeding that is unfair comprehends proceedings that are brought for an improper purpose or which are oppressive, even where a fair trial is possible: Williams v Spautz [1991-1992] 174 CLR 509 at 519-521, 552-553; Walton v Gardiner [1992-1993] 177 CLR 378 at 392-3 (although the latter case concerned disciplinary proceedings). It is clear the jurisdiction is exercised only in exceptional circumstances and that courts should exercise their jurisdiction rather than decline to do so, especially in respect of the trial of criminal charges but the courts should not be deterred from permanently staying such proceedings in appropriate circumstances: Willams v Spautz 174 CLR at 519-2.  
    101   It is, therefore, necessary to examine whether proceedings now being brought to seek conviction for offences under s 79 and s 81 of the Act, as they stood in 1981 in respect of sexual acts in private between consenting adults, are capable of serving the purposes of the criminal law. If not, then they are instituted for an improper purpose, even though there is no ulterior motive in those responsible for their institution and the trial itself may be fair. The same principle applies if the proceedings will result in a weakening of public confidence in the administration of justice (cf Ridgeway, per Gaudron J, (1995) 78 A Crim R 307 at 353). In a case where personal motives underlying the prosecution are immaterial, an abuse of process will not have occurred unless the trial (which, as such, may be fair) and the verdict themselves serve an improper purpose having regard to the functions of the criminal law and the administration of criminal justice. 102   It has frequently been said that the fundamental purpose of the criminal law is the protection of community from crime: see, eg, Jordan CJ in R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554 at 555, where his Honour went on to say that, as a consequence -  
     
      
       
       “...the judge should impose such punishment as, having regard to all the proved circumstances of the particular case, seems, at the same time, to accord with the general moral sense of the community in relation to such a crime committed in such circumstances, and to be likely to be a sufficient deterrent both to the prisoner and to others.” 
       
      
    103   In Channon v The Queen (1978) 33 FLR 433 at 437 Brennan J quoted with approval a passage from the judgment of Herron CJ in R v Cuthbert (1967) 86 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 272 at 274, where he said - 
     
      
       
       “The function of the criminal law and the purposes of punishment cannot be found in any single explanation, for it depends both upon the nature and type of offence and the offender. But all purposes may be reduced under the single heading of the protection of society, the protection of the community from crime.” 
       
      
    104   Consequently, there is no abstract principle which the criminal law is designed to vindicate. To use the language of Gallop, Mathews and Madgwick JJ, sitting as a Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in R v P (unreported, FCA, 29 May 1998), criminal sanctions “are not inflicted judicially except for the purpose of protecting society; nor to an extent beyond what is necessary to achieve that purpose”.  
    105   A trial which results in an acquittal will not, for that reason alone, have been an abuse of process although, if it can be seen in advance that acquittal is inevitable, a stay will be granted: Ridgeway (1995) 78 A Crim R 307. Of course, even a finding of guilt may, in the end, carry no conviction (eg, under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) but subjection to criminal proceedings and a finding of guilt is of itself undoubtedly a penalty and, hence, dismissal of the charge is not treated as an acquittal for the purpose of the rights of appeal: s 10(5) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; R v Luscombe (unreported, NSWCCA, 22 November 1999). This is obviously so where the defendant’s liberty is restricted by being placed on a good behaviour bond. Even where the charge is simply dismissed, there will have been a finding of guilt, which involves the denunciation by the Court of the behaviour found to be proved. Where there is a conviction but, for example, the defendant is sentenced to the rising of the court, this will comprise a penalty. As Kirby J observed in Pearce v R (1998) 156 ALR 684 at 715 “entering a conviction is itself part of punishment”, and has long been so regarded (see also R v Ingraessia (1997) 41 NSWLR 447 per Gleeson CJ at 449).  
    106   None of these examples of possible disposition of a criminal proceeding are inconsistent with the proper purposes of the criminal law or the administration of criminal justice. Rather, they demonstrate that the protection of the community from law breakers may be accomplished in a variety of ways and include undertaking public proceedings and the finding of guilt. Even where there is an acquittal, the purpose of the proceedings is to secure a denunciation, a degree of appropriate punishment and rehabilitation upon the assumption that, if committed, the community must be protected from the crime in question. 107   In the circumstances of this case, the only proper result of a trial confined to events occurring in or after 1981, if there were a verdict of guilty, is that the trial judge, for the reasons I have mentioned, should not enter a conviction but, rather, exercise the powers of the Court under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 not to do so and dismiss the charge. At most, no more than a nominal punishment could properly be imposed. The only purpose, then, of the prosecution in this event would be to denounce the respondent for having, between 1981 and 1984, committed private acts which were made criminal by a law repealed by the Parliament sixteen years ago in recognition of its discriminatory and unjust character and from which the community has not needed the protection of the criminal law for many years. The only witness against him will be the adult with whom he had consensual relations, who will not be prosecuted. The respondent will have had his liberty restricted by subjection to bail and obligatory attendance at court, and suffered the expense and humiliation of a public trial and the ignominy of a finding (if that be the verdict) that he had committed a crime.  
    108   The Parliament effectively declared in 1984 what the relevant community standards were, namely, so far as sexual relations between adults were concerned, that homosexuals and heterosexuals must be treated equally by the criminal law. This was no mere technical adjustment of the system of criminal justice but a substantial repudiation of the previous order. Whatever may have been the situation in 1981, no present public interest is capable of being vindicated by any proceedings against the respondent for sexual acts with the complainant which occurred after 17 December 1980. They can serve no proper purpose of the criminal law. The court would simply have been made the instrument of oppression. It is not surprising that the Director of Public Prosecutions has said that he does not wish to prosecute such a case. The character of the repealed law all the more strongly demonstrates the pointless and oppressive injustice of such proceedings. Can this Court order that it be stayed?109   In Connelly v Director of Public Prosecutions [1964] AC 1254, Lord Pearce said ([1964] AC at 1365) that a court has a duty to stop a prosecution which “creates abuse and injustice”. Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest stated ([1964] AC at 1301-2) that the inherent power of a court “to prevent abuses of its process and to control its own procedure must in a criminal court include a power to safeguard an accused person from oppression or prejudice”. But his Lordship remarked ([1964] AC at p 1304) that it would be “an unfortunate innovation if it were held that the power of a court to prevent any abuse of its process or to ensure compliance with correct procedure enabled a judge to suppress a prosecution merely because he regretted that it was taking place”. Lord Devlin posed the question in this way ([1964] AC at 1354) - 
     
      
       
       “Are the courts to rely on the Executive to protect their process from abuse? Have they not themselves an inescapable duty to secure fair treatment for those who come or are brought before them? To questions of this sort there is only one possible answer. The courts cannot contemplate for a moment the transference to the Executive of the responsibility for seeing that the process of law is not abused.”  
       
      
     
    110   As Toohey J pointed out in Ridgeway (78 A Crim R 307 at 338), this “passage asserts the power of the courts to act; it does not, and does not purport to, identify the scope of the power”. Ridgway concerned the intended prosecution of a person who was party to the illegal importation of heroin by law enforcement officers. Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ rejected the submission that Australian law recognized the defence of entrapment and were able to vindicate the Court’s duty to maintain the integrity of its processes by holding that the exclusion of the evidence of importation on public policy grounds rendered inevitable the failure of the trial and, hence, such a trial should be stayed. Their Honours said (78 A Crim R at 322) - 
     
      
       
       “Once it is concluded that our law knows no substantive defence of entrapment, it seems to us to follow that the otherwise regular institution of proceedings against a person who is guilty of a criminal offence  
       for the genuine purpose of obtaining a conviction and punishment 
        is not an abuse of process by reason merely of the circumstance that the commission of the offence was procured by illegal conduct on the part of the police or any other person.” (Emphasis added.) 
       
      
    111   Their Honours noted that there was “a significant distinction in principle between staying criminal proceedings on the ground that the proceedings in themselves constitute an abuse of process and staying further steps in the proceedings on the ground that, due to the effect of evidentiary rulings made in them, they must fail”: 78 A Crim R 322-2. However, I do not understand them to be saying that, where the latter course was not available, a stay of the former kind would not be granted. Where allowing a trial to proceed at all would offend the court’s sense of justice, it seems implicit that a stay would be granted. The clear implication of their Honours’ reasoning was that, if entrapment was indeed a defence in Australian law, a stay may well have been granted (see, also, Toohey J, 73 A Crim R at 340-1, Gaudron J at 353-4, McHugh J at 360-2).  
    112   The principle was stated by Lamer J, delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Mack (1988) 44 CCC (3d) 513 at 539 (cited by Toohey J, 78 A Crim R at 339) in the following language - 
     
      
       
       “[C]entral to our judicial system is the belief that the integrity of the court must be maintained. This is a basic principle upon which many other principles and rules depend. If the court is unable to preserve its own dignity by upholding values that our society views as essential, we will not long have a legal system which can pride itself on its commitment to justice and truth and which commands the respect of the community it serves.” 
       
      
     
     
      
     That this observation was made in dealing with an entrapment case does not lessen its force. 
      
    113   Gaudron J, in Ridgeway, considered that a stay should be granted because of the nature of the prosecution itself and thus, to this extent, was in dissent. However, I would respectfully adopt her Honour’s pithy expression of the relevant test (78 A Crim R at 352), namely, that a prosecution is an abuse of process that serves “the ends of injustice, rather than justice and might adversely affect public confidence in the courts and in their proceedings”. 
    114   If I may say so, with respect, the remark of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest quoted above sounds an appropriate caution. If this prosecution were taking place prior to the 1984 reforms, I do not think that it would have been right to have stayed it as an abuse of process simply because the judge may have thought that ss 79 and 81 of the Act were unjust and oppressive (subject to what I said above concerning the proper interpretation of s 81). Nor should it now be stayed if the alleged criminal acts are, in substance, still penalised under the substituted offences which are presently operative. That would, indeed, be a triumph of form over substance. Moreover, as was said in Ridgeway, “The function of determining whether, in the circumstances of a particular case, a criminal prosecution should be initiated and maintained is essentially that of the Executive” (per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ, 78 A Crim R at 316). Their Honours go on, however, to say - 
     
      
       
       “Nonetheless, it has long been established that, once a court is seized of criminal proceedings, it has control of them and may, in a variety of circumstances...temporarily or permanently stay the overall proceedings to prevent abuse of its process.” 
       
      
    115   In this case, the applicable rule is that stated by Richardson J in Moevao v Department of Labour [1980] 1 NZLR 464 at 482 (cited with approval in Jago (168 CLR at 30) by Mason CJ) - 
     
      
       
       “The justification for staying a prosecution is that the Court is obliged to take that extreme step in order to protect its own processes from abuse. It does so in order to prevent the criminal processes from being used for purposes alien to the administration of criminal justice under law. It may intervene in this way if it concludes from the conduct of the prosecutor ... that the Court processes are being employed for ulterior purposes or in such a way ... as to cause improper vexation and oppression. The yardstick is not simply fairness to the particular accused. It is not whether the initiation and continuation of the particular process seems in the circumstances to be unfair to him. That may be an important consideration. But the focus is on the misuse of the Court process by those responsible for law enforcement. It is whether the  
       continuation of the prosecution is inconsistent with the recognized purposes of the administration of criminal justice 
        and so constitutes an abuse of the process of the Court.” (Emphasis added.) 
       
      
    116   In dealing with abuse of process in the context of criminal proceedings, the two fundamental considerations are the public interest in ensuring that the court’s processes “are used fairly by State and citizen alike” and the ability of the court to protect its functions to avoid “an erosion of public confidence by reason of concern that the court’s processes may lend themselves to oppression and injustice”: Williams v Spautz (1991-1992) 174 CLR 509, per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ at 520. 
    117   In all the circumstances of this case, I consider that the continuation of any prosecution against this respondent for acts which would not be crimes had they been committed after the 1984 reforms would amount to an abuse of the process of the Court. (I should mention that I consider that, for a variety of reasons, s 61N of the Act would not apply to the acts alleged here, had they occurred after 7 June 1984.) Such proceedings would serve the ends of injustice rather than justice and bring the court into disrepute. Accordingly, if the indictment were so interpreted as to permit the jury to convict the respondent in respect of events that occurred after 17 December 1980, the trial should be permanently stayed. For this reason also, the appeal should be dismissed.  
    118   Even if the dates in the indictment might not be vital, neither party sought to put this argument before the Court as a reason for disposing of the appeal. Whilst I would not go so far as to say that the Court should never act upon its own view of the law where the parties ask the Court to deal with a matter on a quite different basis, I do not think that in the circumstances of this case we should change the nature of the appeal so fundamentally. Even if it be the law that a prosecution can still proceed for behaviour which has not been criminal for sixteen years, I do not see why, in effect, this Court should exercise its discretion on its own motion to vary the argued grounds of appeal to bring about this result. 
    119   For these reasons, even if I am mistaken about the significance of the times specified in the indictment for the offences with which the respondent is charged, and in my view that a trial on the residual basis proposed by Grove and Smart JJ would be an abuse of process, I do not consider that the appeal should be upheld. 
     
       
    120   SMART AJ: The background and the facts are set out in the judgment of Grove J. On the hearing of the application for a permanent stay the judge had before him a draft indictment and the affidavit of the solicitor for the accused, the annexures referred to in it, mainly the two statements of the complainant, the transcript of his evidence at the committal proceedings and that of the evidence of a police officer. There was no evidence from the accused. 
    121   The draft indictment contained eight counts, four counts alleged that the accused indecently assaulted the complainant, (a male), between 19 December 1979 and 30 June 1980 and one count alleged buggery in the same period. The other three counts related to the period 1 November 1980 to 18 December 1980: two counts alleging indecent assault and one count alleging buggery. Each count related to a specific incident.  
    122   The complainant’s evidence in the committal proceedings was to the effect that the acts charged took place in 1980 subject to the proviso that some of the earlier acts may have occurred in late 1979. The complainant was sure that the acts charged occurred before his eighteenth birthday on 19 December 1980. Eighteenth birthdays are significant in most families, marking the arrival of adulthood.  
    123   In his affidavit the solicitor said,  
     
      
       
       ""I am informed and verily believe that the defence...is that any contact of a sexual nature which may have taken place between the accused and the complainant in fact took place after the complainant had turned 18 years.""  
       
      
    124   This is a guarded and general statement. It does not deal with any of the specific instances of which the complainant gives evidence. Nor does it state the sources of information and belief. It seems to have been assumed that it was the accused. The Crown did not cross-examine the solicitor.  
    125   At the hearing before the judge counsel for the accused stated:  
     
      
       
       ""The defence to this case is, as deposed to by my instructing solicitor that sexual contact did, in fact, take place but not during the years 1979, 1980. It in fact commenced after 1980, that is when the complainant was considered in law to be an adult not a child"".  
       
      
    126   Later, counsel for the accused said: 
     
      
       
       ""...there is no dispute that incidents of a sexual nature did occur. The defence is that they did not occur in the year 1980; they occurred, in fact, in the year 1981 at which time the complainant was an adult anyway.""  
       
      
    127   The concession is in very general terms. There is no concession that the particular acts alleged occurred but rather that incidents of a sexual nature did occur.  
    128   In essence, the Court was asked to grant a permanent stay of proceedings upon the basis of some instructions given by the accused to his solicitor, the antiquity of the alleged offence and the absence of records for the period 1980-1981. The instructions given are entirely untested. Permanent stays should not usually be granted on the basis of instructions, deposed to by an accused's solicitor or some person other than the accused. Generally, it would be wrong for a Court to act on the accused's instructions when these are unverified by the accused. There may be cases however, where admissible evidence can be given by persons other than the accused which would justify the granting of a permanent stay.  
    129   In the present case no point was taken by the Crown that there was no evidence from the accused as to his stated defence, namely that no sexual activity occurred between the complainant and the appellant in 1980. Generally, in a case such as this such evidence should be led. The absence of such evidence does tend to weaken the accused's case for a permanent stay. If an accused wants the benefit of a permanent stay there is nothing unfair as a general principle, requiring him to verify his position.  
    130   However, this raised a problem. If the accused said that the incidents alleged happened in 1981 the appellant was guilty of the offences charged. It is the incidents which are the subject of the charges. In the present case, the dates are not critical. If the accused said that no such incidents occurred but that there was other sexual activity in later years then he would not be guilty. He would be entitled to refuse to give details of such other sexual activity on the grounds of self-incrimination.  
    131   There is a need for the accused to know the case which he has to meet, to be supplied with proper particulars and not to be confronted with a new case at the trial. Once it is remembered that it is the identified acts of the accused and the incidents which are important I see nothing unfair in the dates being treated as not being of the essence of the charge. Apart from the point as to whether the offences were committed prior to 19 December 180, it was not suggested that the dates were relevant for any other reason, for example to lead alibi evidence or to cast doubt upon the happening of the incidents alleged.  
    132   In amending the Crimes Act 1900 and decriminalising sexual intercourse between consenting adult males, the legislature did not do so retrospectively. It is not for the Crown or the accused to endeavour to step around the terms of the legislation and to involve the Court in such endeavours. It is against the public interest for false issues to be presented and fought. I could understand the prosecution deciding not to prosecute or a Court, if the jury convicted imposing a nominal penalty or exercising its powers under s. 556 A of the Crimes Act.  
    133   It is incorrect for a Court to grant a permanent stay when it appears to be the defence that the sexual activity alleged took place a year later than alleged but when it was still an offence or a number of offences. For these reasons the exercise of the judge's discretion miscarried.  
    134   I make some additional comments. It is not reasonably open to a Court to regard the loss or absence of any useful records as usually being sufficient in itself to justify the grant of a permanent stay. This is not a case such as Davis (1995) 81 ALR 156. He was a medical practitioner who had seen thousands of patients and his clinical records had been destroyed in circumstances where no blame had been attributed to anyone. The alleged offence had occurred many years previously. Without his clinical records the doctor would not be able to say what he did and why and to give instructions to his counsel.  
    135   It is well established that the loss or absence of documents or records does not of itself mean that a person cannot obtain a fair trial or that the proceedings need to be stayed. The complainant’s eighteenth birthday is a notable event. Even if it were correct to limit the counts in the indictment to events occurring before that day, incidents can be related to the period before or after that day as a reference point. Of course, as the dates of the incidents are not critical the absence or loss of the records is not of significance.  
    136   I would allow the appeal and quash the order granting the permanent stay.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JFriday, 21 July 200070009/00 - REGINA v Wai Hung Anthony LOSENTENCE1   HIS HONOUR: The offender, Wai Hung Anthony Lo, has pleaded guilty to the murder on 20 February 1998 of Albert Brikha and to the conspiracy with Toufic Zreika and Hesham Turkmani on 25 March 1998 to murder Raphael Bessounian. The offender has asked the Court in sentencing to take account under the provisions of s 32 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the following offences -  
     
      
       
      1. the supply on 30 November 1998 at Roselands of two tablets of Nexus to undercover police; 
      
     2. the supply on 16 December 1998 at Miranda of two tablets of methylamphetamine; 3. the supply between 28 January and 24 February 1999 to undercover police at Sydney of methylamphetamine three times within thirty days; 4. the possession on 3 February 1999 at Sydney of a pump-action shotgun; 5. the supply on 8 March 1999 at Brighton-Le-Sands to undercover police of twenty tablets of amphetamine and ketamine; 6. the supply on 24 March 1999 at Brighton-Le-Sands to undercover police of twenty tablets of amphetamine and ketamine; 7. the possession on 7 April 1999 at Liverpool of fourteen rohypnol tablets; 8. the possession on 7 April 1999 at Brighton-Le-Sands of an imitation Berretta pistol; 9. the possession on 7 April 1999 at Brighton-Le-Sands of an imitation of a Sig Sauer pistol; 10. the possession on 7 April 1999 at Brighton-Le-Sands of a Cobra spear gun; 11. the possession on 7 April 1999 at Brighton-Le-Sands of twelve tablets of amphetamine; and 12. the supply on 7 April 1999 at Brighton-Le-Sands of 3.99 grams of methylamphetamine. 
     
      
    2   The offender is twenty-nine years old. He began working as a panel beater and completed his apprenticeship in 1993. Eventually he set up his own business. The business did not do well and he began to supplement his income by working as a security guard at nightclubs in Sydney. As he did so he encountered certain people he had met during the course of his work as a panel beater, including Colin Kaddour, “Big” Hicham Kaddour, Hesham Turkmani and his brother Bassam Turkmani. The offender had previously known those men as tow truck operators, but he realised that they were also concerned with drugs. Hesham Turkmani supplied him with a small quantity of an illegal drug and the offender began selling drugs supplied by Hesham and Bassam Turkmani and Colin Kaddour. He bought and sold on credit and found himself unable to pay his debts to his suppliers. He also owed between $50,000 and $60,000 to credit providers. 
     
      
    3   Albert Brikha was to give evidence against a man called John Assadourian, who was to be tried for shooting at Mr Brikha with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The Kaddour family were associates of Assadourian in the tow truck industry. They offered Mr Brikha money to try to persuade him not to give evidence against Assadourian but he refused those offers. The trial of Assadourian was imminent and they decided that the only way to stop Mr Brikha giving evidence was to have him killed. 
     
      
    4   They knew that the offender could not pay them what he owed. There was a meeting between Colin Kaddour and Bassam Turkmani at the offender’s residence. One of them said to the offender words to the effect of, “Pay up or do a job for us and don’t worry about the debt”. The offender replied, “Okay, if that’s what I have to do”. He thought that he was going to be asked to sell more drugs or to threaten someone or to kidnap someone they had previously spoken about. It was explained to him that it would be a murder. He decided to do as he had been asked. 
     
      
    5   Not long after Christmas 1997 those instructing the offender planted a semi-automatic pistol and silencer in a place where he would find it on one of his rounds. He took the pistol and test-fired it. They supplied him with Mr Brikha’s name and address. The offender had a good idea that the killing was to be part of a fight between tow truck operators. 
     
      
    6   He made elaborate preparations. He telephoned Mr Brikha’s house and falsely reported a breakdown in a certain place. He concealed himself and waited for Mr Brikha to arrive at that place and observed him closely as he did so. That was so that he would remember his face when the time came to shoot him and not have to resort to the use of photographs. Two days before the murder he disguised himself and went to Mr Brikha’s house. He tried to entice Mr Brikha into his car by offering to take him to another pretended breakdown. His intention was to shoot Mr Brikha in the car. Mr Brikha was suspicious and refused to go. 
     
      
    7   The offender decided to shoot Mr Brikha as he came home from work one night. He falsely reported a domestic disturbance in the street in which Mr Brikha’s house was situated so as to ascertain how long the police would take to respond to a call for help. 
     
      
    8   He chose the day to carry out the murder and telephoned Bassam Turkmani to warn him that he thought that he would shoot Mr Brikha that night. That was so that Turkmani could arrange an alibi. 
     
      
    9   On 20 February 1998 the offender had his girlfriend drive him to the vicinity of Mr Brikha’s house. He had previously fully loaded the pistol and had wiped all the cartridges with methylated spirits as instructed to remove fingerprints. He concealed himself in bushes near the garage of the house to which Mr Brikha was due to return. He screwed the silencer onto the pistol and cocked it. As Mr Brikha returned home and walked up the driveway towards the house the offender discharged the weapon at him at least four times. He ran away and his girlfriend drove him away from the area. 
     
      
    10   Two days later Colin Kaddour and a colleague Toufic Zreika gave him $10,000, took the pistol from him and dismantled it. They and Bassam Turkmani removed the pistol parts. 
     
      
    11   In July 1996 Raphael Bessounian met Zreika and another man in Campsie over the sale of drugs. There was a disagreement and Zreika and the other man shot Bessounian four times. He survived. Zreika was charged over the shooting and Bessounian was to be a witness in the case against him. Zreika threatened Bessounian that he would be stopped from giving evidence, but Bessounian was not intimidated. Zreika decided to kill him to stop him giving evidence. 
     
      
    12   The offender was a friend of Bessounian but knew nothing of his dispute with Zreika and his colleagues. Early in 1997 he arranged for Hesham Turkmani to attend his panel beating shop and supply drugs to a purchaser. Bessounian happened to be the purchaser. When Bessounian saw Turkmani he quickly departed and the offender realised that the two men disliked each other. In response to his inquiry Turkmani told him that Bessounian tried to cheat him and that “we shot him a couple of times”. Bessounian later confirmed that there was bad blood between them and that they had shot him. 
     
      
    13   Bessounian was a supplier of stolen mobile telephones, and the offender offered to buy some from him. The offender told Hesham Turkmani that he could supply them to him and Turkmani was interested in knowing the source. The offender told him. Turkmani and Zreika later came to the offender’s residence and one of them asked him to help them kill Bessounian. The offender refused. He refused again a couple of days later. Two more days later they asked him a third time and he asked what was in it for him. Turkmani said that the contract was for $5,000 and the offender refused. On the same or a later day he refused that offer a second time. He said, “It’s got to be more than that”. 
     
      
    14   He began to think about how much money he owed his suppliers. On 25 March 1998 the two men again visited the offender and Turkmani said that they would cancel a certain amount from his debt if he would help them lure Bessounian so that he could be shot. The offender agreed. He was told to call Bessounian and arrange for him to meet him somewhere on the pretext that he would purchase stolen mobile telephones from him. The offender telephoned Bessounian and asked him to meet him at his residence at a certain time. Bessounian fell into the trap. He drove to the vicinity of the offender’s residence and telephoned him. The offender said that he would soon be with Bessounian. Instead he telephoned Hesham Turkmani and told him that Bessounian had arrived. The offender and his girlfriend then went to the casino to establish an alibi. 
     
      
    15   Bessounian was shot by Zreika as he waited in his car. He received six wounds, one to his right upper arm, one to his right forearm, one to his right wrist, one to his right cheek, one to the centre of his chest and one to the left side of the chest. He was taken to hospital, underwent three surgical operations and was not discharged until 18 April 1998. He suffered a comminuted fracture of the right radius and a fracture of one of the right metacarpals. He suffered transient neuropraxia of the right posterior interosseous nerve. He suffered circulatory collapse due to a left haemopneumothorax and had to be taken into cardiac intensive care. A bullet was removed from the right axilla. The report of Dr Winlaw 31 May 1999 shows that the injuries were life-threatening. 
     
      
    16   On 1 April 1999 the offender was tricked by an undercover police operative into revealing the part he had played in the murder. The conversation of the two men was lawfully recorded on tape and a typewritten transcript was made. He told the operative how he had planned the shooting for two weeks, how he had obtained the weapon and the ammunition and how he had tested and prepared them, how he had contrived to see Mr Brikha’s face, how he had attempted to entice him into the car to shoot him, how he had timed a police visit to the same street, how he had observed the movements of Mr Brikha, how he had considered the various places in which he might shoot him and how he had decided that the best place was at his house when he returned from work. Although he gave a long and detailed description of these matters he could not remember the name of the street in which Mr Brikha lived, and arrangements were made for him to point out the house. On 7 April 1999 he and the operative drove to Mr Brikha’s house at Liverpool and the offender pointed it out. He showed the operative the bushes where he had lain in wait for Mr Brikha and from which he had shot him. He told the operative things that only the gunman could have known. 
     
      
    17   He was arrested on the same day and charged with the murder of Mr Brikha and with conspiring to murder Bessounian. 
     
      
    18   Police had obtained a number of statements from Bessounian in which he described how the offender had lured him to the street outside the offender’s residence and how he had been shot there. Bessounian told the police that he had recognised the voice of Zreika as he shot him. Telephone records showed a large number of calls made from the offender’s mobile telephone to a number of mobile telephones to which members of the Kaddour and Turkmani families had access. 
     
      
    19   There was a very strong case against the offender on both charges. He was taken before a magistrate on 8 April 1999. The case was adjourned and bail was refused, and the same thing happened on a number of other occasions. The offender had legal advice and must quickly have realised the high probability of conviction on both charges and the very serious consequences which would result. No doubt on legal advice, he attended the New South Wales Crime Commission four times in October 1999 and made a number of statements. He undertook to assist the Crime Commission in its investigation and to give evidence in the prosecution of others concerned with the murder and the conspiracy to murder. 
     
      
    20   On 18 January 2000 he pleaded guilty of both offences before a magistrate and was committed to this Court for sentence. 
     
      
    21   It was submitted on behalf of the offender that these offences, or at least the murder of Mr Brikha, did not fall into the worst category of offences bearing in mind that the offender was a young man when he committed the offences, that his life was out of control, that he was in debt and living in an unfamiliar world and was not a hardened criminal. 
     
      
    22   I do not accept these submissions. Notwithstanding his fairly young age, the offender was well experienced in his unlawful businesses and knew well the people with whom he was dealing. His approach to the offers was that of a businessman. 
     
      
    23   In my opinion the criminality of the part played by the offender in the murder of Mr Brikha constituted an offence which fell into the worst category of cases. There are several reasons for this. The crime was planned and executed entirely without anger and without mercy. The offender had no quarrel with Mr Brikha. He did not even know him. He murdered him simply for money. The law has long regarded contract killings as falling into the worst category of murders. 
     
      
    24   The murder was meticulously planned over a long time. The offender took steps to find out what Mr Brikha looked like and to understand his pattern of movements so that he could be sure to kill the right man as quickly and efficiently as possible. He took careful steps to get away and avoid detection. 
     
      
    25   The fact that the murder of Mr Brikha is the first offence of which the offender has been convicted does not in all the circumstances entitle the offender to leniency. Ordinarily a first offender may be dealt with leniently as having led a previously blameless life, but this offender was a man of markedly bad character. His efforts to make an honest living having failed, he entered into a life of systematic crime and appears to have subsisted in large measure through the purchase and sale of illegal drugs and stolen goods. 
     
      
    26   In setting the trap for Bessounian the offender involved himself in what was intended to be his second contract killing. Again, he had no reason other than money to want his victim dead. On the contrary, he was a friend and did business with Bessounian from which he presumably profited. He refused early offers of money because they were not high enough. The process of negotiation took a few days and the offender participated in a hard-headed manner. Finally he agreed to play a part in return for the cancellation of his debt. He coolly made the arrangements that he fully expected would result in the death of Bessounian. He did so in a manner that provided him, he thought, with an alibi. 
     
      
    27   In sentencing for conspiracy the Court may take into account in assessing the level of criminality whether the crime agreed upon was committed or attempted. In fact the intention failed and Bessounian did not die, but that was a matter of good fortune. As it was, Bessounian suffered serious and life-threatening injuries. The offender’s part in the attempt to kill him was carried out coolly, efficiently and completely. The failure to kill Bessounian resulted from the actions of Zreika, not the offender. In my opinion the fact that Bessounian did not die does not take the offender’s criminality out of the worst category of offences of its kind. 
     
      
    28   Of the offences the offender has asked the Court to take into account, those occurring between 30 November 1998 and 24 March 1999 resulted from transactions between the offender and undercover operatives during the ordinary course of his drug business. The six offences committed on 7 April 1999 resulted from searches of the offender and his premises carried out by investigating police officers after his arrest. They reflect the offender’s serious and systematic pursuit of his criminal enterprises and would have attracted a substantial total effective sentence by themselves. 
     
      
    29   S 61(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that a court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence. Subs (3) provides that nothing in subs (1) affects s 21(1). S 21 (1) provides that if by any provision of an Act an offender is made liable to imprisonment for life (as the offender is on the first count, by virtue of s 19A Crimes Act 1900) a court may nevertheless impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term. 
     
      
    30   In my opinion the facts of the murder and the conspiracy ought ordinarily to attract the maximum sentence, namely imprisonment for life and twenty-five years respectively. The substantial question that arises is whether the assistance offered and given by the offender is sufficient to entitle him to receive less than the maximum penalty for each offence. 
     
      
    31   Before going to the details of the offender’s assistance I should say something about his pleas of guilty. A plea of guilty is capable of affecting a sentence for two reasons. The first is that it is ordinarily proper to encourage by way of a reduction in sentence the saving of community resources which results from such a plea. The community is saved time and money and the defendant receives a corresponding benefit. However, I am of the view that the objective seriousness of these two offences was so great that, standing alone, the pleas of guilty would be insufficient to remove these offences from the worst category of offences. 
     
      
    32   In a practical sense, however, the value to the community of the pleas of guilty may be considered together with the value to the community of the assistance the offender has given and promised. 
     
      
    33   The second way in which a plea of guilty may sound in a sentence is as evidence of remorse. I am firmly of the view that the offender’s pleas of guilty are no evidence of remorse and I am satisfied that he is not remorseful. It is not only that it would be too much to expect that after a studied and systematic life of crime he might suddenly see the error of his ways and repent. No doubt such a thing could happen, but there is no evidence that persuades me that it has happened here. The offender did not even tell the Court that he was remorseful. If further evidence were needed of his cold-heartedness, this passage from the tape recording made on 1 April 1999 would be enough. The offender was speaking about the occasion on which he went to Mr Brikha’s house and tried to entice him into the car. Mr Brikha’s wife and children were present. 
     
      
       
        
        Operative: So why didn’t you do it there and then? 
         
         
        Offender: On the spot that day.. 
         
         
        Operative: Yeah. 
         
         
        Offender: ..in front of him? 
         
         
        Operative: Yeah. 
         
         
        Offender: It wasn’t viable. 
         
         
        Operative: Oh right. 
         
         
        Offender: Because if I had done him I would have had to do his wife and his kids and everything. 
         
         
        Operative: Huh-huh. 
         
         
        Offender: And it’s my principle I don’t do that. 
         
         
        Operative: Right. 
         
         
        Offender: Unless you were gunna pay for it. And after I saw the fuckin’ Australia’s Most Wanted his wife’s crying, I really fuckin’ felt bad. Fuckin’ human nature but still a job’s a job, someone’s gotta do it. 
        
       
      
    34   I conclude from the circumstances I have summarised that when he went to the Crime Commission in October 1999 the offender expected, whether he pleaded guilty or not, that he would be convicted of the offences with which he had been charged and very probably receive the maximum prescribed sentences and that he reasoned that the only way in which he might receive lesser sentences was to offer and give such assistance as he could to the investigating and prosecuting authorities. I do not intend by putting the matter in this way to suggest that the offers of assistance were less than genuine, but simply that for the offender they represented a calculated attempt to do whatever he could to improve his position. The arrangements into which he entered required him to plead guilty, of course. 
     
      
    35   On 21 October 1999 the offender provided a statement which dealt in detail with his work and criminal history, with particular reference to his dealing in drugs and his relations with those who wanted Mr Brikha and Bessounian killed and about the detail of the arrangements made for the murder of Mr Brikha. On 8 November 1999 he made a further statement setting out the detail of the arrangements made to lure Bessounian to his death. He identified records of calls between mobile telephones and told the Crime Commission investigators as much as he knew about the owners and users of the several telephones involved. Altogether he attended the Crime Commission four times. He gave sworn evidence at a Crime Commission hearing. 
     
      
    36   On 8 November 1999 he was interviewed by officers of the New South Wales Police Service and made an induced statement setting out the detail of the part he had played in the attempt to lure Bessounian to his death. 
     
      
    37   Zreika had been arrested on 5 June 1999 and made an induced statement at the New South Wales Crime Commission on 24 November 1999, giving details about the Brikha murder and the parts played by himself, the offender and others. However, there is no evidence that he made any statement about the plan to murder Bessounian. 
     
      
    38   As a result of evidence provided by the offender and others Colin Kaddour and Bassam Turkmani were arrested and charged with soliciting to the murder of Mr Brikha. Their committal hearings are part heard in the Local Court. The offender has given or will give evidence at that hearing and will give evidence at the trial if Kaddour and Turkmani are committed for trial. 
     
      
    39   Zreika was charged with wounding Bessounian with intent to murder on 30 July 1996, with wounding him with intent to murder on 25 March 1998 and with threatening a witness. The offender gave evidence at Zreika’s trial in the District Court, limited, of course, to the events of 25 March 1998. Zreika was found guilty and sentenced to a series of long periods of imprisonment. 
     
      
    40   Hesham Turkmani was charged with soliciting to the murder of Bessounian and with being an accessory before a shooting with intent to murder Bessounian. He was discharged by a Local Court magistrate on 26 May 2000 and the Director of Public Prosecutions is considering whether to file an ex officio indictment. If he is tried it is expected that the offender will give evidence. 
     
      
    41   S 23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that a court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted or undertaken to assist law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to the offence concerned or any other offence. Subs (2) requires the Court to consider a number of matters in deciding whether to impose a lesser penalty and, if so, the nature and extent of the penalty it imposes. Subs (3) provides that a lesser penalty must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. 
     
      
    42   I will deal only with those considerations required by subs (2) which appear to have particular relevance to this case. Two such matters appear to favour the Crown in its argument that no lesser penalty than the maximum should be imposed. They are the effect of the offence on the victim or victims and on the family of the victim or victims and whether the assistance relates to the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced or for some other offence. 
     
      
    43   Although the effect of a murder upon the family of the murdered person may not be taken into account in fixing the sentence, it may be given weight in the consideration of and may possibly stand in the way of a lesser penalty for assistance to the authorities. That is the combined effect of R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 and s 23(2)(a) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    44   These offences had a very serious effect upon the partner and children of Mr Brikha and upon Bessounian. A victim impact statement was tendered on behalf of Ms Michelle Louise Escott, the partner of Mr Brikha. She was at home with her children when the offender killed Mr Brikha. She heard the shots and ran outside. He died in her arms. She went into shock and could not stop screaming. She cannot forget what happened. She is being treated for depression and post-traumatic stress syndrome has been diagnosed. The couple had three children. The two eldest, a girl and boy, miss their father and are very distressed at what has happened. The youngest child was only little when Mr Brikha was killed and has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. He has communication and behavioural problems which require close and special attention. 
     
      
    45   The family have lost the financial support that Mr Brikha provided and live on income from Social Security. Life is consequently very difficult in view of the special needs of the youngest child. Ms Escott has sold the house where she, Mr Brikha and the children lived because she could not face bringing up the children in that place. 
     
      
    46   I have already summarised the injuries received by Bessounian and their effect. He was badly hurt and his life was threatened. Fortunately there is no evidence of any serious permanent incapacity. 
     
      
    47   These consequences are all very serious. 
     
      
    48   Sometimes offenders assist investigating and prosecuting authorities not only in relation to matter with which they have been charged but with unrelated matters as well. The preparedness of an offender to do so is capable, generally speaking, of leading to very high rates of reduction from the sentence that would otherwise be imposed. Here, one need say no more than that the assistance related only to the offences with which the offender himself was charged. That is not to play down the value of it, however. 
     
      
    49   So far as is relevant to this case, the remaining matters to be taken into account appear to favour the offender. The first three may be considered together. They are the significance and usefulness of the assistance, taking into account any evaluation by the authorities, the truthfulness, completeness and reliability of information given or evidence provided and the nature and extent of the assistance or promise of assistance. A letter was received from P Bradley, Commissioner, New South Wales Crime Commission dealing with the assistance given by the offender. It shows that the arrest of Colin Kaddour and Hesham Turkmani resulted directly from the information provided by the offender. It shows that the Crime Commission has assessed as truthful the information the offender has provided. The letter also shows that the offender was largely responsible for the successful prosecution of Zreika. That statement, of course, must be taken as being confined to the shooting of Bessounian on 25 March 1998. The several accounts he has given appear to be complete. 
     
      
    50   The Court must consider whether the offender will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of his assistance and any injury or danger to him or his family. He had a partner at the time of these events. The Court was informed that the relationship is not likely to subsist for long in view of the substantial custodial sentence the offender is facing. There appears to be no danger to the offender’s partner. However, it is quite apparent that, having thrown in his lot with criminals and having informed upon them, he will face danger of injury or death for the duration of his time in custody and perhaps afterwards as well. He will need to take advantage of any protection which may be afforded him in the correctional system, but that will make his service of his sentences harder because it will deny to him the full run of work and other opportunities within the correctional system. 
     
      
    51   The final matter for consideration is any likelihood that the offender will commit further offences after being released from custody. All that it is necessary to say about that is that the offender will have to spend such a long time in custody that it is impossible to predict how he might behave on his release. 
     
      
    52   It seems to me that notwithstanding the serious effect upon the persons affected by these offences, particularly upon the family of the late Mr Brikha, the offender’s assistance and promise of further assistance must be given very great weight in view of their obvious completeness and of the positive results they have already yielded and perhaps will yield, especially in view of the danger the offender will be in for the rest of his life and the harsher sentence he will serve as a result. 
     
      
    53   It was submitted on behalf of the Crown, relying on s 23(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that any penalty less than the maximum prescribed for each of these offences would be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offences. I am unable to accept that submission. The general availability of lesser sentences for offenders who give valuable assistance and thereby place themselves in significant personal danger is an important feature of the administration of criminal justice and results in substantial benefit to the community in the solution of crime and the successful prosecution of offenders who would otherwise go free. Notwithstanding the very serious nature of the offences, it seems to me that the assistance given and offered, and the quality of it, are enough to entitle the offender to sentences less than the maximum prescribed. The reduction which I shall apply to the sentences will be tempered by the serious effect of the offences on those concerned. 
     
      
    54   Although the two principal offences resulted from independent arrangements, they were temporally close and were intimately connected with the offender’s criminal enterprises. It is therefore appropriate to impose substantially concurrent sentences. However, it is necessary to make them partly cumulative in order to reflect the totality of the offender’s criminality. 
     
      
    55   The partial accumulation of the sentences makes it necessary to impose a non-parole period for the murder sentence which is less than three-quarters of the sentence. The adjustment I have made produces a total sentence for both offences the non-parole period of which is three-quarters. There is no other circumstance that requires the shortening of the non-parole period of the murder sentence. It is not appropriate to set a non-parole period for the conspiracy sentence because it will be served wholly within the non-parole period of the murder sentence. 
     
      
    56   Wai Hung Anthony Lo, for conspiring to murder Raphael Bessounian I sentence you to imprisonment for eighteen years commencing on 7 April 1999 and expiring on 6 April 2017. I decline to fix a non-parole period. 
     
      
    57   For the murder of Albert Brikha I sentence you to imprisonment for thirty-two years commencing on 7 April 2003 and expiring on 6 April 2035. I fix a non-parole period of twenty-three years which will expire on 6 April 2026. You will then be eligible for release on parole. In sentencing you I take into account under the provisions of s 32 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the charges listed in the Schedule provided under that section.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JFriday, 21 July 200070024/99 - REGINA v Glen Ian FORDSENTENCE1   HIS HONOUR: The offender Glen Ian Ford was found guilty by a jury of the murder on 14 December 1997 at Tocumwal of Wayne Thomas Jackson. 
     
      
    2   In December 1997 the offender was staying at a camp on the southern bank of the Murray River at Tocumwal with a man called Greg Baldwin. Saturday 14 December was Mr Baldwin’s fortieth birthday and a party was held at the camp in celebration. A number of guests attended, including Wayne Jackson, the deceased, who was a distant relative of Mr Baldwin. Those at the party, including the offender and the deceased, had something to drink. There were angry words between the two of them but the evidence does not enable me to say how they arose. It was submitted that the deceased had threatened the offender and wanted to fight him, but I do not accept that submission because I do not consider that the evidence upon which it was based was reliable. 
     
      
    3   I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the following events happened on the next day. The offender and the deceased were still at Greg Baldwin’s camp. The deceased and others were telling racist jokes. The deceased, who was Aboriginal, told a joke against Aborigines. The offender became irritated and remonstrated with the deceased, who observed that one ought to be able to laugh at oneself. He continued by telling a joke offensive to New Zealanders. Everybody at the camp knew that the offender was a New Zealander. He became more angry and tried to pick a fight with the deceased. The atmosphere became so unpleasant that Greg Baldwin and the deceased and a friend, Steven Peacock, left the camp and walked to a nearby campsite. They remained there, talking to the occupants. 
     
      
    4   Some time later the offender followed them there and resumed his attempts to pick a fight with the deceased, who ignored him. Greg Baldwin went back to his camp to obtain some more beer and returned in due course. 
     
      
    5   The offender also returned to the Baldwin camp, muttering as he did so that he would not stab the deceased in the back but in the chest. When he arrived there he picked up a knife, part of the kitchen utensils, and returned to where Mr Baldwin, Mr Peacock and the deceased were. The unpleasantness continued and for a second time Mr Baldwin, Mr Peacock and the deceased walked away from the offender. They went towards their camp. 
     
      
    6   Once again the offender followed, this time armed with the knife. He caught up with the deceased, who was lagging behind the other two, and repeated, this time to the deceased, that he would kill him and that he would stab him in the chest, not in the back. The deceased must have realised that he could avoid the offender no longer and turned and either threw a can of beer at the offender or hit him with it. The two men closed in a fight and the deceased knocked the offender to the ground. Whilst the offender was on his back on the ground and the deceased was on his feet leaning over him the offender held the deceased’s right upper arm or shoulder with his left hand and stabbed him three times with the knife in his right hand. Two blows hit the deceased’s left upper arm but the third penetrated his chest and went into the heart. The deceased was taken urgently from the camp to hospital but died as a result of that wound. 
     
      
    7   The offender remained at the camp. He and his t-shirt were covered in the deceased’s blood, and he went to the river, washed himself and his shirt and threw the shirt away out of sight. He wiped the knife clean and put it back where it belonged. He kicked dust and rubbish over spilt blood. Then he started making preparations to leave the site. His car would not start and he became very angry and violent when refused a lift into Tocumwal. He went to a good deal of trouble before he finally got his hands on a battery and started his car, but the police arrived before he could get away. 
     
      
    8   It was submitted on behalf of the offender that the Court should have a reasonable doubt whether he intended to kill the deceased. It was pointed out that there were only three wounds and that only one of them was deep and that, according to the evidence of Dr Duflou, only moderate force would have been required to inflict them. If the offender had really intended to kill he would have attacked the deceased with the knife as soon as he brought it back from the Baldwin camp. Instead he secreted it and started a fist fight. 
     
      
    9   I think the offender’s persistent pursuit of the deceased quite remarkable. He told him that he would kill him. More importantly, according to the evidence of Tracey O’Hara, which I accept, the offender said to himself as he walked back to the Baldwin camp to get the knife, “I’ll kill you, I won’t stab you in the back, I’ll stab you in the chest”. Those words and everything else the offender said and did show that for some time before he engaged the deceased the offender’s intention was to kill him. Sometimes people make empty threats to kill, but I do not think that the offender’s threats were empty. I think that he killed the deceased as he told himself he would, by stabbing him not in the back but in the chest. I think that the fact that two of the thrusts wounded the upper arm had more to do with the movement of the deceased than the aim of the offender. 
     
      
    10   I am reinforced in these conclusions by the words and actions of the offender after he stabbed the deceased. He chased the car carrying away the mortally wounded man, yelling, “Come back here, I want to kill you”. He held up his shirt, which was covered with the deceased’s blood, and yelled to anyone who would listen that it was not his blood and that “no black bastard stands over a Kiwi”. When later told by Senior Constable Lovell that the deceased had died he continued his antagonistic attitude. The only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from all this evidence, in my view, is that the deceased achieved what he intended, namely the death of the deceased. 
     
      
    11   It is easy to accept that the offender must have felt insulted about the joke told by the deceased, but it is difficult to understand the reaction which was engendered in him. One might have expected to see an outburst of indignation, even accompanied by violence in a person who lacked self-control, but what the offender did was quite remarkable. Far from cooling down, he became more and more angry as the morning wore on, pursuing the deceased and his companions successively from one place to another and trying to engage him in a fight. The deceased gave him no encouragement, but his refusal to fight appears to have enraged the offender further, so that by the time he reached the Baldwin camp alone he had entirely lost control of his temper and had formed the intention not just to fight but to kill. 
     
      
    12   I accept the evidence of Mrs Madeleine Ford, that the offender was difficult to control as a young child and that his father had a bad influence upon him during his teenage years, with the result that he began to get into trouble with the police. I accept that the behaviour of the offender since he has been an adult has been characterised by a desire, apparently taught him by his father, to exert an inappropriate degree of control over others. 
     
      
    13   I think that the only explanation of the offender’s extraordinary conduct which led to his killing the deceased is a combination of his ingrained desire to control others and the disinhibiting effects of the alcohol he consumed. There is no evidence of precisely how much he had to drink, but I think it must have been a significant amount. 
     
      
    14   It was submitted on behalf of the offender that there is a substantial probability that he will have to serve all or part of his sentence on protection. If that were to happen his movements within the correctional system would be restricted and he would be denied full opportunity to participate in work and other programmes. His sentence would therefore be served hard and that fact ought to be taken into account as entitling him to a more lenient sentence than would otherwise be appropriate. 
     
      
    15   A letter from the Corrective Services Department enclosing a copy of a request of the offender dated 7 January 1998 was tendered. The request was made at Goulburn. As a result, the Court was informed, the offender was on protection from the day of the request to 15 May this year when he was transferred to the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre. Although not now on protection he fears that if he is taken to a prison where there are Aboriginal inmates and they learn about his offence he will again be in danger and become obliged to seek protection. 
     
      
    16   There is no evidence that he will be returned to Goulburn and I would have thought such a move unlikely in view of the recognition by the authorities there that Aboriginal inmates threatened him and that on that account protection was warranted. Whilst I accept the likelihood of the presence of Aboriginal inmates at any institution where the offender is likely to be sent, I think the probability of the offender’s having to spend the whole or even substantial part of his sentence on protection is low. There is simply no proper evidence to enable the Court to find otherwise. However, I have taken this probability into account. 
     
      
    17   The offender’s criminal record includes a number of convictions for offences of violence. He has been in custody a few times, but never for longer than three months. His record is not of the worst kind and he has offended less frequently in recent years than in his youth and early adult years. The troublesome thing about his record is that many of his convictions are concerned with the inappropriate use of alcohol or concern the kinds of offences more likely to have been committed after excessive consumption of alcohol. I accept the evidence of Mrs Ford that excessive consumption of alcohol and the use of illegal drugs have been a part of his life for a long time. 
     
      
    18   The offender underwent psychological counselling whilst he was in custody in Victoria some years ago, but that could only have been for a short time and it is apparent that little progress was made. He has had three substantial relationships with partners, but each has come to an end, apparently as a result of his desire to dominate and control the behaviour of others. It is apparent that he needs every assistance to modify his attitude towards others, otherwise he will continue to be prone to the use of violence when circumstances do not please him. 
     
      
    19   A letter was received in evidence from the Corrections Health Service, under the hand of Dr Koller, a psychiatrist. It is addressed to the offender’s legal representative and refers to earlier correspondence. It states that Dr Koller has seen him on several more occasions, that his behaviour causes no concern, that he is generally co-operative and accepts regular doses of Valium. The letter does not mention why Dr Koller has been seeing him and there is no reference to any diagnosis or prognosis. 
     
      
    20   The offender makes no claim to be remorseful. 
     
      
    21   It seems to me that his chances of rehabilitation depend upon his being able to re-examine and modify his attitudes towards people, to limit his use of alcohol and to learn to control himself whilst under its influence. It is impossible to foresee the course of the offender’s rehabilitation during his time in custody. It is to be hoped that he will accept the assistance that will no doubt be offered in managing anger and about the use of alcohol and illegal drugs. 
     
      
    22   I have dealt with these matters in some detail in order to try to ascertain whether the need for rehabilitation requires a parole period of more than one-quarter of the term of the sentence that I have in mind. I have decided that it does not. In any case, the non-parole period I intend to fix is the minimum one necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    23   A victim impact statement was received from Selina Lyons, the sister of the deceased. The death of the deceased has been a great loss to her and her family, especially because the deceased had come to replace the parents whose nurture she was denied when she was a child. The Court extends its sympathy to her and her family in their loss. Of course, these matters, important though they are, may not be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed. 
     
      
    24   Glen Ian Ford I sentence you to imprisonment for sixteen years, commencing on 14 December 1997 and expiring on 13 December 2013. I fix a non-parole period of twelve years, which will expire on 13 December 2009, when you will be eligible for release on parole.

    3   KIRBY J: In February 1998 the appellant, Mrs Marion Bright, stood trial in Goulburn before his Honour Judge Knight, and a Jury. 
     
      
    4   The appellant faced two charges. They arose out of an incident on 20 July 1996. It was alleged that she was one of a number of individuals who had encircled a house in Goulburn, yelling abuse and making threats against its occupants. Objects, including pot plants, were thrown through the windows. Ultimately, the front door was broken down, and the house invaded. Those in the house included a woman, Mrs Mallott, and her small children. They fled in terror, and hid in the rear of the house. A tomahawk was used to chop through a bedroom door, before the group retreated. 
     
      
    5   The charges against the appellant were, first, that she had broken into a dwelling house, and had committed a felony therein, namely, malicious damage to the house (s112(2) Crimes Act, 1900), and, further, that she was armed with a weapon, namely a tomahawk, with intent to commit an assault (s114(1)(a) Crimes Act, 1900). Mrs Bright pleaded not guilty to both charges. Her defence was essentially an alibi. 
     
      
    6   The trial began on 9 February 1998. In accordance with the requirements of s38(7) of the Jury Act, 1977, his Honour invited the Crown to identify witnesses who would be called during the trial. Upon the basis of that information, a number of jurors sought to be excused. In a country town, even a large centre such as Goulburn, that is not surprising. A jury was then empanelled, and the trial commenced. 
     
      
    7   On Wednesday 18 February 1998, the jury retired to consider its verdict at 12.21 pm. It returned at 2.35 pm. The appellant was found guilty on both counts. 
     
      
    8   The next day a matter was drawn to the attention of the trial Judge. His Honour thereafter, in open court, placed on record the information he had received. He said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “… at morning tea today, 19 February 1998, I was informed by the court attendant who had been attending to the jury during the trial that on Tuesday of this week, that is on 17 February 1998, one of the jurors had said to her words to the effect that that juror had some knowledge of the matter. The court attendant went on to say that she had brought the matter to the attention of the instructing officer of the Crown I understood after the trial had finished and it was now brought to my attention. 
        
       
       
        
        Having received that information I have spoken to Mr Fernandez, the instructing officer to the Crown, who confirmed that he had also been told that and that a statement was being prepared, that statement to be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions and also to be sent to the legal representatives of Marion Ann Bright. It seems to me that that is the appropriate course in the matter, I regard my - although I still have to sentence Marion Ann Bright other than that I would regard myself as functus officio in relation to doing anything about the trial itself, the jury has been discharged following their verdicts and there is no step that I can take, and in my view that I should take, and it is now a matter for parties to consider their positions in relation to the matter and whether they wish to raise it before the Court of Criminal Appeal.” 
        
       
      
    9   The court attendant was Mrs Rae Martin. Mrs Martin worked as a part time Sheriff’s Officer. She was interviewed by the police after the incident. She made a statement dated 19 February 1998. She later acknowledged her statement was incomplete. She had attempted to shield a police officer, who had provided certain information, and her superior at the Sheriff’s Office. She was interviewed for a second time, this time by Mr Hamilton, attached to the Wollongong Sheriff’s Office. A further statement (dated 24 February 1998) was prepared. Mrs Martin, on this occasion, was rather more frank. She was later reinterviewed by the police. She made yet another statement (17 March 1998). In addition, the appellant was given leave to rely upon an affidavit sworn by Mrs Martin, dated 30 June 2000. 
     
      
    10   The Crown also sought, and was given leave, to rely upon a number of affidavits. A police officer, Snr Const John Schultz, swore an affidavit of 4 July 2000 and, Mr Fernandez, solicitor, an affidavit of 7 July 2000. 
     
      
    11   Because the matter came to the notice of the trial Judge after the jury had been discharged, the issue was never investigated by him. Determining what took place, upon the basis of the material placed before this Court, is not entirely satisfactory. However, the broad picture does emerge. 
     
      
    12   Snr Const Schultz was a witness. He was attached to the Goulburn Police Station. On Friday 13 February 1998, he was approached by another prosecution witness, Mr Clint Mallott. He was told that a person named “Jay” had been seen speaking to a female member of the jury. Mr Mallott recognised “Jay” as being someone linked to the family of the accused. 
     
      
    13   Snr Const Schultz drew the matter to the attention of the solicitor for the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Crown Prosecutor. One gathers, however, that nothing was done. Specifically, it was neither drawn to the attention of the trial Judge, nor counsel for the accused. 
     
      
    14   On the following Monday, 16 February 1998, Snr Const Schultz made further enquiries. He determined that the person “Jay” was Mr Jay Butler. Mr Butler was, through marriage or through children, closely associated with the family of the accused. Again, Snr Const Schultz drew these matters to the attention of the solicitor for the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Crown Prosecutor. 
     
      
    15   Snr Const Schultz spoke to Mrs Rae Florence Martin, and a court monitor (Val). He related his knowledge of the Friday incident. His account suggested that the son of the juror played football with the son of one of the families. 
     
      
    16   Mrs Martin was disturbed by this information. She, and the person Val, believed that the matter should be drawn to the attention of the Crown Prosecutor. The Crown Prosecutor said, however, that the information was “only hearsay”. He declined to take it further. 
     
      
    17   That response did not satisfy Mrs Martin. She clearly remained concerned. She spoke to her immediate superior, Mr Wassall Bilokin. He, however, immediately silenced her. He said, “Shut your mouth, you know nothing, and I know nothing.” 
     
      
    18   Such an attitude was unfortunate. Had the matter been drawn to the attention of the trial Judge, it could have been investigated. The juror could have been discharged, if that were appropriate, and the remaining members of the jury (if they were not discharged), given an appropriate warning. 
     
      
    19   Mrs Martin remained concerned that the accused would not receive a fair trial. She therefore resolved to speak to the jury herself. She now recognises that this was inappropriate. 
     
      
    20   On Tuesday 17 February 1998, shortly before the evidence concluded, she called the female members of the jury panel to one side. Addressing them as a group, she said this (according to her original statement): 
     
      
       
        
        “Somebody said that on Friday afternoon one of the jurors was spoken to by a young person who said, ‘See you later Mum’ and this person was to do with the Littles or the Mallots (sic), is that right? Do any of you or your child have anything to do with the Littles or the Mallots?” 
        
       
      
    21   One juror, a young woman responded. The accounts given by Mrs Martin differ, to some extent, as to that response. Her original statement (19 February 1998) was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The youngest girl out of the jury said, ‘I’ve got a son, he plays football.’ I can’t remember what she was saying but she said something about Carney Charles, I don’t know if he was a coach or whether he just had kids playing football with her young son. She said something about knowing about the case and that Carney Charles had told her, I don’t remember the exact conversation. She said this in front of all the other ladies and I said to her, ‘You shouldn’t be on the jury.’ That was it.” 
        
       
      
    22   The accused was a member of the Little family. Her defacto husband was Mr Carney Charles. Her alibi defence involved the suggestion she was with Mr Charles, and others, on the evening of these events. 
     
      
    23   Mrs Martin made a further statement several days later to the Sheriff’s Officer. According to that statement, her conversation with the jury was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “’I do have a son who plays football, and has something to do with football, with Carney Charles and they told me what happened the night of the incident.’ I did not know what she meant by ‘they’. I said to her ‘you should not be on the jury, you should have stood up and told them you know people on the case.’ She said ‘but I was scared to say anything.’” 
        
       
      
    24   This conversation took place in the presence of other women on the jury. 
     
      
    25   Mrs Martin’s third statement, made to the police on 17 March 1998, included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “’I have a son he plays football.’ She also mentioned the name Carney Charles, but I don’t know what she meant. I didn’t hear what she actually said, I don’t know whether it was to do with taking his kids or he knew her or something, I didn’t hear, so I didn’t know. She said, ‘They told me about the night of the incident.’ I said, ‘You had no rights to be on the jury.’ She said, ‘I was scared’.” 
        
       
      
    26   Mrs Martin again spoke to her superior at the Sheriff’s Office. Again, she was told to remain silent. She should act “like the three monkeys”. Shortly thereafter a verdict of guilty was returned by the jury. 
     
      
    27   Mrs Martin remained disturbed about the information which had come to her notice. She again spoke to the solicitor for the Director of Public Prosecutions. She told him what had occurred with the jury. The solicitor immediately recognised the need to bring the matter to the notice of the Judge, the Crown Prosecutor, and Counsel for the accused. At last this was done. His Honour Judge Knight was approached in chambers, and thereafter made the statement set out above. 
     
      
    28   The jury, of course, are the judges of fact. A person should not sit as a juror if, in all the circumstances, the parties, or a fair minded and informed member of the public, might entertain a reasonable apprehension that he or she might not bring an impartial or unprejudiced mind to the resolution of questions involved in the trial (Liversey v NSW Bar Association (1983) 151 CLR 288 at 293). 
     
      
    29   That test was applied by the High Court in  Webb & Hay v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41. In a lengthy murder trial, a juror spontaneously presented a bunch of flowers to the mother of the deceased. The mother was not a witness. Mason CJ and McHugh J said this: (at 46/47) 
     
      
       
        
        “In our opinion, the test that his Honour [the trial judge] should have applied was whether, despite the warning that he proposed to give to the jury, the circumstances of the incident would still give a fair minded and informed observer a reasonable apprehension of a lack of impartiality on the part of the juror.” 
        
       
      
    30   The trial Judge had determined the matter by enquiring whether there was a real danger that the position of the accused might have been prejudiced. Their Honours rejected that test. They said this: (at 52) 
     
      
       
        
        “… where the conduct of a juror is in issue, it will often be difficult to determine objectively whether the incident has affected or might affect the impartiality of the juror and whether directions to the jury were or will be adequate to protect the parties from the effect of the irregular incident. To place confidence in a test based on the assumption that an investigation will reveal all the facts of the incident may lead to a miscarriage of justice. In our experience the investigation of such incidents during the course of a trial is not exhaustive. Ordinarily, the judge simply asks the juror for an explanation. However, a juror involved in an irregular incident may feel defensive about his or her role. Understandably, the juror may seek to put the best light on the matter. Seldom, if ever, is there a detailed cross-examination of the juror by counsel or by the judge in such a case … One can never be certain, therefore, whether all the circumstances have been elicited by the trial judge. If real danger or bias was the governing criterion, the judge might reach a conclusion opposite to that which he or she might have reached if all the facts were known. The reasonable apprehension test, on the other hand, allows a margin for error in evaluating the facts as elicited. It concentrates not on whether there is a danger of bias as an objective fact, but whether a fair-minded and informed person might apprehend or suspect that bias existed.” 
        
       
      
    31   Here, because the issue was never brought out into the open, there are many unanswered questions. Three matters, all important, remain unclear. First, when did the juror receive information concerning the incident? Was it at the time of the incident itself, or was it after the trial began? Secondly, what was said? What was the information about the incident provided to her? Thirdly, did that juror say anything to anyone else on the panel? 
     
      
    32   The answer to each of these questions was capable of affecting the suitability of that juror, or the panel. Given that the Sheriff’s Officer had made enquiries in front of a number of jurors, it would not be surprising had such jurors then discussed the matter (which would have been disturbing) with that juror. Contamination of the entire panel, therefore, was a significant possibility. 
     
      
    33   The Judge, in the course of his summing up, gave a number of directions, reminding the jury of the need to determine the issues on the evidence, and do so in an unprejudiced way. However, because his Honour was never apprised of what had taken place until after the verdict, nothing was said by way of warning in respect of the specific conversation. In this respect, the facts are quite different from R v Gibson ([1999] NSWCCA 370). 
     
      
    34   It may be said that the information imparted to the juror was likely to be favourable to the accused. It came from a source said to be associated with the accused’s defacto husband. However, that does not diminish, in my view, the nature of the irregularity that had occurred. Indeed, it is not fanciful to imagine that other jurors, having witnessed the exchange between the Sheriff’s Officer and the juror concerned, may have believed that an attempt had been made to influence them. Had that been their perception, they may well have resented such interference, and reacted adversely to the accused. 
     
      
    35   I believe that there must be a new trial. The parties, or the public, on these facts, would, I believe, have a reasonable apprehension that the juror concerned, if not the entire panel, might not have brought an impartial and unprejudiced mind to bear upon the resolution of the issues. 
     
      
    36   Mrs Martin, incidentally, should be commended for resolutely pursuing what she believed was unfair, even though the method she ultimately chose (speaking directly to the jury) was inappropriate. 
     
      
    37   The orders I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. The appeal should be allowed. 
       
       
      2. The convictions should be quashed. 
       
       
      3. There should be a new trial.

     REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
      
    1    The Prisoner has pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation, viz. that at the time of the commission of the offence he threatened the victim with actual bodily harm. The offences arise under Section 61J of the Crimes Act and each renders the Prisoner liable to imprisonment for 20 years.2    I have been also asked to take into account in sentencing the Prisoner for the offence referred to in the third count of the indictment, four further offences on a schedule signed by the Prisoner. Two of these are identical in nature with the four previously mentioned. The other two are of threatening to inflict actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse. Section 61K of the Crimes Act prescribes that the maximum penalty for these offences also is 20 years imprisonment. The circumstances of the eight offences - of which I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt despite a limited amount of evidence from the Prisoner to the contrary - were as follows. 
     
      
       
       A. Indictment Count 1 
       
      
    3    At about 12.15 am on 23 December 1995 victim 1 was walking down the driveway of a block of units where she lived at Balgowlah. The Prisoner approached her from behind and placed one hand across her mouth and a scalpel or, as the Prisoner described it, a works knife, against her throat. He said “don’t say anything or I’ll cut you”, pushed her against a fence and said “where’s your money”. He stuffed what the victim thought was a dark sock in her mouth and fondled one of her breasts. The Prisoner then demanded the victim put her hands over the fence and she did. He then undid the belt and zip of the jeans the victim was wearing and put a hand down insider her underpants and rubbed her labia. He removed his hand and pulled the victim’s underpants down and returned his hand to her genitals, on this occasion inserting a finger into her vagina and thrusting it in and out for some time.4    Then, still with the scalpel at the victim’s throat, he took his hand away from her vagina and undid his own belt and pants. With the front of his body against the victim’s back his hand again returned to her vaginal area and his hand movements became more frantic and forceful. He again moved his hand away and demanded the victim bend over. She did so and he sought to insert his penis into her vagina from behind. His penis was not erect and he failed.5    Soon afterwards he stopped, pulled up his pants and said to the victim “I’m not going to rape you. I won’t rape you because I’ve had too much to drink and you’ve had to much to drink. So if you don’t move and don’t say a fucking word, you’ll be alright because I won’t hurt you.” The victim nodded her head. The Prisoner pulled the gag out of her mouth and walked up the driveway towards the street. The victim did not move for some little time then went to her unit and called the police. She felt that her attacker had had a balaclava on.6    The victim was 25 years old at the time. Following the incident she had a light cut across the front of her throat, a small cut on the inside and outside of her upper lip and her mouth was sore and bruised. There were small scratches on the inside of her lower lip. When seen by a doctor later in the day, the victim was extremely distressed.7    In oral evidence the Prisoner asserted that he was at Balgowlah on the day in question because he had dropped someone off. There was no evidence to the contrary. The Prisoner also said that either before or after seeing the victim he went out of his way, parked his car, alighted and followed her. When asked why, he could give no explanation beyond saying he lost control.  
     
      
       
        
       B. Indictment-Count 2 
       
      
    8    At about 10.40 pm on 28 March 1996 victim 2 alighted from a train at Artarmon Railway Station and walked to the block of units in which she resided in White Street, Artarmon. Shortly after arriving at the block she commenced walking up the stairs from the garage area. About half way up she saw and was passed by a man dressed in black walking down. Shortly thereafter she was pushed against the wall. The man asked “Do you have any money?” and “Are you a virgin?”. He shoved a thick sock or piece of rag a short distance into her mouth. It came out and fell onto the stairs. He said “If that happens again, I’ll kill you. Don’t do it again” and the victim felt something sharp and cold at her throat. Later she saw it was a knife like a hunting knife with a jagged edge on the blade. The victim could feel the knife push deeper into her throat with every move she made. The Prisoner pushed the sock back into the victim’s mouth - so far in she felt she was going to choke. He said “Don’t worry, I won’t hurt you”.9    The Prisoner took the knife away and pushed the victim against the wall again. He pulled the pants and underpants she was wearing down to her ankles and returned the knife to her throat. He inserted his other hand between the victim’s legs from behind, rubbed around the labia and penetrated her vagina with one or more fingers. This or these he thrust in and out saying, inter alia, “Does this feel good?” and “Are you a virgin?”. His activities hurt. He removed his hands and the victim then felt what I infer was the Prisoner’s flaccid penis near her vagina. The victim turned, took the sock out of her mouth and said words to the effect “No. I’m not doing that”. The Prisoner turned her and again pushed her face and body into the wall ordering “Get your hands back up against the wall and don’t move”. The victim felt the knife go back against her throat and the sock back into her mouth. Then he penetrated her again. The victim said she was not sure whether it was with his hand or penis this time. She said the object felt hard and different from the first time she was penetrated and when whatever it was pulled out it was not as hard as when it went in and seemed slippery and wet. After the police were involved, the victim’s clothing and a vaginal swab were taken but the results of any testing of these are not in evidence. There is thus no basis for concluding that the Prisoner ejaculated but the evidence to which I have referred satisfies me that this further penetration was by the Prisoner’s penis.10    After stopping, the Prisoner said “If you tell any one I’ll come back and I will find you and will kill you” and left. The victim then went to the unit in which she lived and told her sister and parents of what had occurred. 11    At the time the victim was 17 years old. When examined on the following day she was tearful and the doctor observed redness and tenderness on the heels of both hands, two parallel red lines about 8cm long across the front of her throat and redness and a small abrasion around the vaginal area.12    Asked why he was at Artarmon on the occasion of this attack, the Prisoner suggested he might have been to TAFE that night but otherwise could give no explanation. A statement from the financial controller of his then employer, shows the Prisoner ceased work that day at 2.32 pm. The day was not one on which he had TAFE classes which, in any event, were held at Ultimo. The Prisoner also advanced the proposition that on some afternoons he played golf. That explanation also does not account for the time between dusk and 10.40 pm.13    The Prisoner agreed it was possible he had spent some hours in the vicinity looking for a victim. Later, he said he was on his way home, there was a petrol station nearby and he thought he stopped to get petrol. He asserted firmly that on at least one occasion he obtained petrol at Artarmon. In other evidence concerning his presence at Artarmon he said it was an alternate way home from the city to Berowra or Kenthurst. Having regard to the geography and road system, that is an explanation I do not accept. Artarmon was not on any logical or normal route for the Prisoner to take when driving home. It might be possible, just, to go to Artarmon for petrol but the number of service stations on the Pacific Highway between North Sydney and Longueville Road, or adjacent to the intersection of the Gore Hill Freeway and the Pacific Highway and the presence of a “huge Shell service station” on Epping Road a few kilometres west of the Pacific Highway makes this unlikely and, given the movements of the Prisoner as disclosed in evidence, inconceivable as a reason for his presence there as often as he was. 14    The Prisoner said that on the night he was wearing a black hooded Sloppy Joe or tracksuit top and on alighting from his car put a hood over his head. 
     
      
       
       C. Form 1 - First Offence 
       
      
    15    At about 11.40pm on 6 May 1996 victim 3 arrived by train at Epping railway station and commenced to walk home. In Chesterfield Road she heard someone behind her, a hand went over her mouth and she was pushed into a brick fence. Her assailant demanded money. The victim offered her wallet and a little later a black sock or perhaps some other material was forced into her mouth. Her breasts were squeezed and the blade of what looked to her like a fishing knife was pressed into the right side of her back. She was then grabbed around the top part of her body and shoved down a driveway into some shrubs. She started to scream and the assailant became more aggressive. He said “Don’t scream, you’ll be alright. The victim noticed that the knife was on the ground. The assailant picked it up and held it against her again. He then pushed the victim back out towards the brick fence and placed her hands on it. He again raised the topic of money and credit cards. The victim showed him her wallet again. A little later he again fondled her breasts, undid a couple of buttons of her jeans and thrust his hand inside her underpants. According to the victim, he felt her clitoris and around the outside of her vagina. She had her periods, and a tampon was inside. Nevertheless, the terms of the charge and his plea mean he must have penetrated her genitalia. The victim described her assailant’s actions in this regard as firm but not really violent. The assailant told the victim “Right. Don’t scream. Don’t call the police cause otherwise I will hurt (or get) you” and ran off. The victim walked quickly to her home. 16    The victim was 18 years of age. She received a slight cut to her bottom lip. At the time of arriving home she was crying, shaking and hyperventilating and could not talk properly. She objected to her sister calling the police because “He’s going to get me”. Nevertheless, later they were called. 17    The Prisoner said he did not clearly recall this incident. The statement of the financial controller indicates that he did not work that day. There were no TAFE classes either. The Prisoner could not recall the day or where he had been. He denied sitting at the railway station looking for potential victims - evidence the accuracy of which, having regard to my views of the Prisoner’s credibility - I do not accept. He agreed he was wearing the same black hooded Sloppy Joe as that worn on 28 March and the knife was in the pocket of the Sloppy Joe. He had again put the hood over his head. 
     
      
       
       D. Form 1 - Second Offence 
       
      
    18    This offence was one under s61K of threatening to inflict actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse.19    At about 10.55pm on 14 May 1996 the fourth victim was walking down Shirley Road, Wollstonecraft when she heard sounds as if she was being followed. As she opened the door to the foyer of the unit block in which she lived a man put one hand over her mouth and the other around her waist. He had a knife in one hand. He started to drag the victim through the foyer to some stairs at the rear leading down to the garage. This involved passing the door to another unit in the block which the victim kicked twice as she called for help. The assailant had forced the victim about half way down the stairs when she heard the door which she kicked being unlatched. Her assailant let go and ran off.20    The victim, who was 39 years old at the time, suffered two small cuts to a lip and her chin, two distinct bruises and was left feeling sore all over. Her glasses costing $270 were damaged. When examined later in the evening by a medical practitioner, she appeared very anxious. 21    The victim of this offence was the only one from whom a victim impact statement was obtained and tendered. In it she discloses that she is unnerved still by the sight of a man in a hooded jacket, and by reports or jokes of rape and knife attacks; she re-lives what could have been the end of her life. She feels an inner turmoil and her heart pounds when in a crowded street.22    The victim says that she has become withdrawn, depressed and frightened and illustrates this by detailed examples. At times, she has lost her appetite to the point where her skin was peeling because of malnutrition. Although she has had intercourse since the Prisoner’s attack, she has lost interest in the act and now feels it is dirty - so much so that after she has had intercourse she has showered numerous times and has had Dettol baths to cleanse herself. 23    The victim’s statements as to some of these effects are supported by a 1997 report from a sexual assault counsellor at the Royal North Shore Hospital. A letter from a Dr Chan indicates that prior to the attack the victim was suffering from a chronic pain syndrome, that significant progress was then being made but that the attack adversely affected her condition and since the attack occurred the victim has frequently needed pain-killers and injections of Valium to calm her down. I accept that the Prisoner’s attack has had an effect on the victim such as I have described.24    The Prisoner did not work on 14 May but attended TAFE that night until, apparently, 8.30 pm. He saw the victim at the top of the hill, presumably on the Pacific Highway, and turned off, parked and followed her. He was wearing the same top and acknowledged that it was useful because it had a hood which could be put over his head. The Prisoner gave evidence that he desisted from his attack on this victim because he realised what he had done. That is a possible explanation although I am not disposed to rely on his evidence. The history of events satisfies me that the imminent intervention of a third person was at least a major contributing factor to the Prisoner’s desisting.  
     
      
       
       E. Form 1 - Third Offence 
       
      
    25    This is the second offence under s61K. 
     
      
       
      
    26    At about 8.30pm on 30 May 1996 the fifth victim was walking home from Artarmon railway station. When about 2 blocks from the station the Prisoner came up behind her, put his hand on her mouth and demanded money. He also demanded she open her mouth wider and be quiet and he then put a glove in it. He put a knife to her neck. Then some cars passed by and every time this occurred the Prisoner moved away from the victim and then returned. A voice was heard and the Prisoner then ran away.27    The victim’s age was 24. She was a student from Japan. When she arrived home she was upset and started to cry but apparently suffered no physical injury.28    On 30 May the Prisoner was stood down without pay and had no classes in the evening. He said that he could not recall why he was at Artarmon on this occasion. 
     
      
       
       F. Indictment - Third Count 
       
      
    29    On 17 September 1996 at about 9.50pm the sixth victim alighted from a train at Artarmon station. She walked to a key card machine directly opposite the station and withdrew $100 from the machine which she put in a bag she was carrying. She then walked along Hampden Road, across the bridge over the freeway, and into Taylor Lane. There a male voice called out from behind her “Give me your money or I’ll hurt you”. She screamed “Help!” and the male grabbed her. He said “Shut up. Shut up. Shut up or I’ll use my knife on you.” Understandably the victim became scared and began to shake. She handed the man the $100 and said “Please don’t hurt me. Please don’t hurt me.”30    He pushed a dark coloured rag into her mouth and again said “Shut up or I’ll hurt you.” The victim saw him holding a knife which he then applied to her throat and pulled her down the lane saying “Give me all your credit cards” and “Give me all your cards”. The victim gave him a key card and her driver’s licence. During the course of this exercise he had put his hand under her jumper and fondled her breasts. There is a pedestrian tunnel which goes under Hampden Road (or possibly Herbert Street, which is a continuation of it). The tunnel is dark. The assailant dragged the victim about 5 metres into the tunnel still with the knife against her throat. She was crying “Please don’t rape me. Please don’t rape me”. He said “Shut up I won’t rape you.” He grabbed her hands and forced them behind her back and tied them up. The victim’s head hit the wall. 31    From behind, the assailant then unzipped her pants and pulled them and her underpants down to her ankles. He started to touch her vagina with his fingers. He put one inside and moved it around. Again she pleaded “Please don’t rape me” and again he said he wouldn’t. He then unzipped his fly and said “Just for a little bit” and the victim said she felt his penis go inside her vagina for a short time after which he removed it and again touched her vagina with his hands. He then put his penis back inside her vagina and started moving it in and out. The victim said “Please stop it I won’t tell anybody I promise, I promise”. After a short time the Prisoner withdrew his penis and pulled up his pants. At about this time he picked up and looked at the victim’s driver’s licence and said “I’m going to go. I know where you live, so if you tell any body I’ll come and get you, because I know where you live”. He untied the victim’s hands and lifted her jumper up over her head. He again placed a finger inside her vagina, then grabbed the rag out of her mouth and ran off. The victim picked up the bags and cards she had been carrying and ran straight to work.32    When the victim arrived at work she was observed to be crying hysterically and complained to work mates of what had occurred. Examined at about 10.30 pm that night she was observed to be very tearful and to have, inter alia, swelling of, and abrasions to, her lips and a small abrasion to her finger. She also suffered a small graze on her neck.33    This sixth victim was 23 years of age at the time. After the attack she moved from where she was living because she was frightened that her assailant knew where she lived. Some months later she still felt nervous and anxious and she did not go out at night: In December 1996 she said that she did not think she could live on her own again and “I haven’t been back to work since and I am being moved to another location by my employer as I feel to (sic) anxious to go back to Artarmon.”.34    It is in connection with this offence that I am asked to take into account the offences referred to in the Form 1. On the day of this offence, the Prisoner had been to his TAFE classes which finished at 8.30pm. Again he said that he did not know, and could think of no reason, why he was in Artarmon on the occasion of this offence. He said he was not waiting but was driving in his car when he saw the victim. He agreed that he drove slowly behind, following her for quite some distance before he confronted her. His evidence that he had no plan of confronting her or attacking her is impossible to accept. He had again put on the black hooded Sloppy Joe. Although he had threatened this victim as I have recounted, the Prisoner asserted in evidence that he had no intention of hurting her (by way of carrying out his threat to come back if she reported the incident). I accept this evidence.  
     
      
       
       G. Indictment - Count 4 
       
      
    35    At about 10.30pm on 22 October 1996 the seventh victim arrived by train at Artarmon station. She walked down Frances Street and via an alleyway to the entrance of the block of units in which she lived. As she put her key in the door, the Prisoner came from behind and put a knife to her neck and a cloth deep into her mouth saying “Shut up, if you do what I say I won’t hurt you. All I want is your credit cards.” The victim gestured to her bag but the Prisoner forced her to a fairly secluded laundry drying area nearby. Inside he pushed the victim against the wall and pulled her jacket over her head. He then put his knife to her waist and with his other hand undid her bra and touched her all over including her breasts. He then pulled her skirt and panties down and fingered the victim’s vagina roughly, causing pain. He stopped, put the knife back to her neck and said “You have a choice. I can either rape you or you can give me a head job. Are you going to give me a head job?”. Faced with these alternatives the victim nodded to indicate she would provide the latter. 36    At the instructions of the Prisoner, the victim went down on her haunches and turned around, spitting the cloth out of her mouth. The Prisoner then forced his penis deeply into her mouth thrusting it in and out about 10 times. He then withdrew, turned to the side and ejaculated. He told the victim to face the wall which she did and asked had she any money. She gave him $10 and he said “Stay down. Don’t make a noise, and if you don’t tell the police or anybody else, I won’t hurt you. Are you going to tell the police?” The victim said “No”. The Prisoner said “If you do, I’ll come back and kill you” and then began to walk off. The victim began to say aloud words to the effect “Where’s my key? Where’s my key?” The Prisoner then walked back towards her and said “Your key is in the door”, and again walked off.37    The victim then ran to her unit and then gave her flat-mate an account of what had occurred. He wanted to phone the police but the victim resisted saying “No, because he said if I do, he’ll come back and kill me.” So initially a friend in the police force was notified.38    Examined later that night the victim was shaking and tearful. She had a slight swelling in her upper lip and a 5cm linear mark on her neck. There was redness around her vagina and an abrasion consistent with removal of a very small area of skin by a fingernail. At the time the victim was 22 years old. The Prisoner had a TAFE class scheduled for the night of this attack but was marked as absent. He said he thought he was driving around in the vicinity of the railway station probably looking for an attractive woman and again had the Sloppy Joe and knife with him.39    When interviewed by the police the Prisoner admitted the commission of this offence but put something of a different gloss on it. Thus, for example, he said that the victim had helped and after he had ejaculated the victim “pecked” the end of his penis. I reject this evidence. It is inherently improbable and I was not impressed with the Prisoner’s credibility. 
     
      
       
       H. Form 1-Fourth Offence 
       
      
    40    At about 1.00am on 24 December 1996 the victim of this offence alighted from a bus and commenced to walk to her home in Eastwood. As she passed the Kent Road public school the Prisoner grabbed her from behind saying “Don’t scream. I’m not going to hurt you. I just want your money.” The victim collapsed onto the ground. He told her to get up and that he had a knife. He helped her up and pushed her into the driveway of the school. There he ordered her to open her mouth and put a gag in it. Then he forced her arms behind her back and tied them up. He then pushed her further into the school grounds by which time he had a knife to her neck. He said “I’m not going to rape you.” and “I’m going to search you.”. He put his hand up the victim’s blouse and fondled her breasts. He then undid the drawstring of her pants and put his hand inside her pants and underpants and inserted a finger in her vagina. Then he pulled her pants and underpants down, told her to bend over and pushed her back so that the victim bent at the waist. Then from behind he inserted a finger or fingers in her vagina and moved them around saying things like “Are you a virgin? I’m not going to rape you.” and “Have you ever given head?”. Somehow at that stage the victim managed to scream and the Prisoner then forcefully applied the knife to her throat and she thought she had been cut. Then the Prisoner undid the victim’s hands. She pulled her pants up and he said “Keep walking straight ahead.”. He then ran off. The victim ran home and told her father and the police.41    At the time of the offence the victim was 16 years of age. She resisted being medically examined for some time. On 28 December she was seen by a doctor at Royal North Shore Hospital who observed as the only abnormality irregular marks on the front of her throat as if made by a serrated sharp object.42    The Prisoner gave evidence that on the evening prior to this offence he had been at a Christmas party and was in the vicinity because he had chosen to drive past his mother’s home nearby to check on it. Given the hour of the day, 1 am, the last part of this account is inherently improbable and I reject it.43    (In the above accounts of the Prisoner’s offences, I have referred to more than one instance of penetration of most victims. In some of the authorities, it is clear that different instances of penetration, have been the subject of separate counts. However, it has been agreed that I should treat each count and offence referred to in the Form 1 as encompassing all of the acts of penetration which occurred with the particular victim.) 
     
      
       
       Other Conduct Prior to Arrest 
       
      
    44    The Prisoner’s activities led to a police operation “Allier” directed to them. At some stage the Prisoner was suspected and surveillance of him commenced.45    On 22 January 1997 for something over an hour in the late afternoon he was observed driving around a limited number of streets in the Macquarie Park area and within this period to watch one female walking along the street. 46    On 29 January 1997 during much of a period of about 2 hours after about 4.30 pm the Prisoner was observed driving up and down Glebe Point Road some 30 to 35 times at speeds between 5 and 30km per hour looking, on numerous occasions, at female pedestrians. From time to time he stopped his vehicle against the kerb for periods of between a half and two minutes. At about 7.30 pm he was observed driving three times around a route in the vicinity of Epping railway station.47    On 30 January 1997 he was seen to be driving at between 5 and 10 kms per hour in the direction of a female undercover police officer. She turned into the driveway of a block of units. He stopped his vehicle at the driveway and appeared to be looking in the direction she had gone.48    On 4 February 1997 on a number of occasions between 3.40 and 5.01pm and then later, the Prisoner was seen driving in a limited number of streets in the Macquarie Park area and looking at female pedestrians. At 5.09 pm, 5.16 pm and 5.18 pm he was observed looking at a female and child in a park. By 5.24 pm the female and child had left the park and were walking in a nearby street. They were still or again under observation by the Prisoner whose vehicle was travelling at 20kms an hour.49    At 6.52 pm on the same day the Prisoner was followed to the Epping railway station area. There he was seen to be watching a female pedestrian in Oxford Street. She walked along that street to Norfolk Road and ultimately into Grayson Road - a distance of some few blocks. The Prisoner followed her in his vehicle, stopping on four occasions some 20 or 30 metres behind her and allowing her to advance somewhat further before driving on and again reducing the distance.50    There is other evidence in the same vein. Of course the Prisoner does not stand charged with any offences arising out of his activities on these days when he was under observation and he is not to be punished in respect of them. The matters to which I have referred do however reinforce the conclusion which the combined circumstances of the 8 offences with which I have to deal would suggest, viz. that the attacks on at least some, and I would infer most, of the victims of those 8 offences were not chance happenings occurring on the spur of the moment, or perhaps more accurately, after he sighted his victims, but premeditated and planned events. I am satisfied to the requisite standard that they were.51    Evidence contained in a statement from a Miss C leads to the same conclusion. Objection was taken to her evidence but when I ruled it admissible, counsel for the Prisoner took no objection to it being provided in the form of a statement from her. In the statement she describes in detail an occasion in winter 1996 being observed by a man in a car near Artarmon station and then, as she walked home, seeing him and his car some streets along her way, again watching and later following her - at a run after she began to run. About mid-August 1996, she saw the same car and man again driving in the area, and again observing and apparently following her. On Sunday 5 January 1997 she again saw the man in the same car apparently waiting and watching in the vicinity of Artarmon station. The car was that of the Prisoner. Although it is a matter of inference, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt from this fact and the other evidence in the case that the person in the car was the Prisoner. Although I do not need to rely on it, this conclusion reinforces that expressed above that there was premeditation and planning in at least most of the Prisoner’s attacks.52    A more difficult issue to determine is which of the Prisoner’s offences involved premeditation and planning prior to him seeing the victim. Even if it was only then that his criminal intent was formed and implementation of it commenced, his criminality was high. However, in light of what the High Court said in Pearce v R (1998) 72 ALJR 1416, it seems to me that I should seek to consider in the case of each of the offences whether the Prisoner’s criminality extended to searching out a victim or only arose when he saw someone who might answer that description.53    I have in recording the circumstances of the Prisoner’s eight offences largely set out his evidence as to his presence at the scenes of them. Particularly is this so in the case of the second offence concerning his presence at Artarmon where 4 of the offences occurred and where he was observed by Miss C on other occasions. Although it may help to account for times as distinct from his places, mention may also be made of evidence he gave that, at times, he just slept in his car -by inference wherever he was - due to tiredness. Relevant also is evidence he gave in answer to some questions of mine:- 
     
      
       
        
         
         HH Mr Kay, could I interrupt? The evidence before me suggests, and feel free to disagree, that on a number of occasions you seemed to have placed yourself with your car in the vicinity of railway stations at a time when people were walking home from the train? 
          
         A Yes. 
          
         HH That you then took an interest in one or more of those people walking home? 
          
         A Yes. 
          
         HH And followed them? 
          
         A. Yes. That’s correct. 
          
         HH Now, you said earlier that after the first attack with which I am concerned you had realised that on that occasion you were not in control? 
          
         A Yes. 
          
         HH Can you give any explanation why you kept on putting yourself adjacent to railway stations and those sorts of places, knowing what had occurred previously? 
          
         A No, I can’t explain my behaviour at all. All I can - as I said, I don’t know what triggered it. The first instance I had been drinking. It had been a Christmas function. I hadn’t had that much drink that I was intoxicated or couldn’t drive, but there was alcohol involved and I think I somewhat put it down to maybe that was a weakness, part caused, or added to it, or whatever, and I thought that I would be in control. Why it got to the stage of being in those places or putting myself in that position, I can offer no excuse or no reason. I would like to find out why. I don’t know whether it is subconscious or what. I honestly cannot answer.” 
         
        
       
      
    54    I can not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was any planning prior to the Prisoner seeing (at Balgowlah) the victim of the first offence with which I am concerned. Neither the evidence of later events or, given the length of the intervening period, the offences of years ago, or the two in combination would justify such an inference to the required standard. By similar reasoning and the fact that the second offence occurred at a quite different place, even though this was near Artarmon railway station, I reach the same conclusion in respect of that offence, notwithstanding the Prisoner’s evidence that “I had driven around before, but not necessarily looking for a victim as such”.55    By the time of the sixth offence, 17 September 1996, and which like the seventh offence and the following of Miss C in and after winter 1996 occurred in the vicinity of Artarmon Railway station, I am satisfied that the Prisoner was adopting a practice of actively looking for victims and locating himself where they were likely to be. Indeed I would infer that this was so by 30 May 1996 when the fifth offence occurred in the same vicinity. By that stage the Prisoner’s interest in the commission of such offences was clearly whetted and I do not accept his evidence to the effect that, presumably on happening to see his victims, he went out of control.56    I am tempted to reach the same conclusion in relation to the 6 and 14 May, the time of the third and fourth offences which occurred at Epping and Wollstonecraft, but ultimately am not prepared to do so beyond reasonable doubt. There may well have been a legitimate explanation for his presence at the places where he first saw the victims. That said, it does seem clear that even at the time of these offences, the Prisoner was very ready to follow any young female he happened to see in dark and reasonably isolated places. 57    As I have said when recounting the circumstances of the second offence, the Prisoner did give as an explanation for being at Artarmon “at least on one occasion” the need to purchase petrol and while I did not find his evidence persuasive, I would not be prepared to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that this never occurred. Nevertheless, even if the Prisoner’s presence at Artarmon after winter 1997 was due to some need for petrol, I have no doubt that he took the opportunity to look for such victims as might be there available to him.58    I have expressed my views on some of the evidence given by the Prisoner but I should say more. I accept that he may have had no detailed recollection of some of his offences and of the events of the day leading up to them. Nevertheless, I formed the firm view that he was inclined to down-play his premeditation and criminality. He provided no satisfactory explanation for his conduct. He said that after the first offence, he was disgusted with himself, ashamed and scared by what he had done. He said that on two occasions he was physically sick afterwards. He agreed or said that on some occasions he was out of control. Yet, as is both clear and admitted by him, on a number of occasions he deliberately sought to place himself in circumstances where he could commit similar offences.59    I find it impossible to escape the conclusion that, during the period covered by his offences he was either not significantly remorseful for what he had done, or, was so driven by his instincts or other desires that any remorse was overcome. The argument that at the time of his offences, society needed protection from him is compelling.60    Furthermore, it is clear that the Prisoner lied to the police when he denied involvement in any of the offences other than the one I have numbered 7. I am satisfied also that his account of the seventh incident was deliberately untruthful. His statements concerning that incident were calculated to suggest willing co-operation to the extent whereby the victim “pecked” the end of his penis after he had ejaculated in her mouth. Such ejaculation was asserted expressly or impliedly in answer to 3 questions, yet both the victim and, in the witness box, the Prisoner asserted his penis was not there when ejaculation occurred. 
     
      
       
       After Arrest 
       
      
    61    The Prisoner was arrested on 18 February, 1997 and has been in custody ever since. On that day he was informed that his arrest that day related to a number of serious sexual assaults committed upon women. He said “You’ve got the wrong man”.62    Approximately 2 hours later at the Chatswood police station Detective Sergeant Jacobs spoke to the Prisoner and indicated he proposed to ask some questions about the offence that was committed on 22 October 1996 at Artarmon. The Prisoner was informed that semen was recovered from the woman involved. He was informed also that he had been under surveillance for some time and had been observed some few days earlier having sex with a prostitute, that a condom had been recovered from the location where that occurred and that a DNA examination of the semen in that condom was being conducted. The Prisoner was informed that at that stage the testing had excluded 1,999 out of every 2,000 members of the population and that testing which would exclude or include the Prisoner with a far greater probability was continuing. The Prisoner responded to the effect that he was responsible for the sexual assault on 22 October 1996. 63    Later, he was informed that the police were also making inquiries into a number of other sexual assaults in the North Shore area. He responded by asking whether there was any other DNA. Detective Sergeant Jacobs said he was not prepared to say and the Prisoner responded “Well I know nothing about those other matters”. Some time afterwards he re-affirmed that the only sexual assault he had committed was that of 22 October.64    During the evening a formal ERISP dealing with the incident of 22 October 1996 was conducted and, although the Prisoner’s account varied in some respects from that set out above, he again admitted the commission of that offence.65    On 28 August 1997 he was committed for trial on some 27 charges. Before and since his committal there was a deal of correspondence and some other matters on which reliance was placed on both the topic of the weight to be given to his pleas and admissions and on the issue of contrition or remorse. Some reference to these matters is accordingly required.66    No later than 5 March 1997, the Prisoner instructed a solicitor who wrote on that day to the police asking for copies of charge sheets, statements and other documentation. There followed discussions and correspondence in which the police indicated that investigations were still continuing but in which, it would appear, they sought an indication of the Prisoner’s attitude. By letter of 21 July 1997, the Prisoner’s solicitor was informed of a number of charges involving the eight victims the subject of the offences with which I am concerned and others involving Miss C and two further victims. 67    The Prisoner did not plead guilty at the committal proceedings to any of the charges then brought although he instructed his solicitor “not to cross-examine any of the victims or to cause any harm to the victims”. The instructions not to cross-examine the victims continued least until 16 February 1999.68    On 19 February 1998 the Prisoner’s solicitor wrote to the DPP advising that he had obtained instructions from the Prisoner to plead guilty to some of the charges and that it was imperative that these be completely determined and dealt with prior to the remainder of the matters being listed. On 10 June 1998 Mr Roots on behalf of the DPP wrote asking whether any decision had been made. The Prisoner’s solicitor replied on 23 June 1998 to the effect that the Prisoner had at that stage informed the Solicitor what charges he was prepared to plead guilty to but that the solicitor was obtaining written instructions. On 27 August 1998, the Prisoner’s solicitor wrote observing that the whole of the police brief had not yet been supplied and noting that it was listed on 18 September for callover. On the same day Mr Roots wrote again referring to the fact that the Prisoner had indicated he might wish to plead guilty to some charges and inviting discussions. It would appear that by 8 December when the DPP wrote again, no specification of these charges had been provided by the Prisoner’s solicitor.69    On 18 September 1998 the matter was fixed for a trial commencing on 1 March 1999.70    On 21 September, 22 December 1998 and 10 February 1999, additional statements were served. In the letter of 10 February, Mr Roots noted that he was yet to receive any indication whether the Prisoner was prepared to make any admissions, was prepared to dispense with the attendance of any Crown witness and whether any part of the ERISP would be the subject of objection.71    On 18 January 1999 Legal Aid for the Prisoner’s trial scheduled to commence on 1 March 1999 was granted. The date from which the grant was said to take effect was 28 September 1998. On 17 February 1999 I was asked to adjourn the trial then listed for 1 March to enable the Prisoner to be psychiatrically examined, inter alia, on the questions of what intent the Prisoner may have had at the time of the offences charged and of his fitness to plead. Taking the view that any suggestion of a lack of intent was fanciful and there was no evidence on the application supporting such a claim or that the Prisoner might have been unfit to plead I refused the adjournment application. My reasons record that at that time it was envisaged that there would be something in excess of 20 counts involving some 11 victims. Statements from some 195 witnesses had been served although Counsel for the Crown indicated he intended to prune that list.72    On 1 March 1999 the Crown preferred the four count indictment and the Prisoner pleaded guilty as I have indicated above.73    The Prisoner is entitled to credit for the utilitarian benefits of his pleas and for his admission at an early stage of his guilt in relation to the offence of 22 October 1996. However, in determining the weight to be given to such pleas or admission, account must be taken of the strength of the Crown case apparent to a suspect - R v Winchester (1992) 58 A Crim R 345, R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. In that regard, Mr Joseph SC, appearing for the Prisoner submitted that, at least in the case of many charges, the Crown case was by no means strong. In that regard he drew attention to various statements of the victims relevant to the identification of their attacker. In the course of submissions he handed up a 20 page document summarising or drawing attention to these.74    As is pointed out in the document, there are a substantial number of points of difference within the victims’ descriptions of their attacker. On the other hand, the modus operandi used in almost all of the attacks was very similar. Having considered all of the matters to which Mr Joseph drew attention, I nevertheless regard the Crown case in relation to each of the victims as strong.75    The Prisoner’s sentence of course will be only in respect of the eight offences detailed at the beginning of these Reasons but the matters to which I have referred in this section indicate that the Prisoner’s admission of guilt in respect of seven of these matters occurred only at a late stage and that, even in respect of the offence of 22 October, his admission occurred in a context where he must have realised the Crown had a strong case. In this case in my view, the admission and pleas were at least substantially but a recognition of the inevitable. Furthermore, the history of events which I have recounted suggests to me that before the Prisoner pleaded guilty, he sought to obtain as much by way of concession from the Crown as he could in return. Such an approach, while not inconsistent with remorse, is hardly demonstrative of it.76    In evidence the Prisoner expressed his apologies to the victims and said that all he had been trying to do for the last 2½ years was to find out what triggered his behaviour. He has sought during his incarceration to participate in a sex offenders’ program but until sentence this has been unavailable to him. He asserted that it has been hard to live with the question of what caused his behaviour unanswered. Dr Westmore gave evidence that he felt the Prisoner was genuine in his desire to know why he had behaved as he had although also said that the Prisoner seemed to have insufficient insight into the effect of his behaviour on his victims. 77    In the circumstances I am inclined to the view that the Prisoner probably does have some remorse extending beyond regret for the consequences he has, and must, suffer. However, in light of his past record and psychiatric assessments to which I refer below, the repetition of his offending, and his failure to seek treatment prior to his arrest, leads to the view that only limited weight should be given to this remorse which has only manifested itself since his arrest. 
     
      
       
       Subjective Circumstances 
       
      
    78    The Prisoner was born on 26th September 1951. He is thus now 48 and was a little over 45 when he went into custody. He was married in January 1974 and divorced in December 1995. He has two children aged 25 and 19 years. In about 1995 he commenced a de facto relationship which seems to have continued until his arrest. He passed his School Certificate exam. By trade he is a reprographics planner or graphic designer. He would seem to have had regular employment. 79    He has a small criminal record. On 29 December 1970 he committed an offence of assaulting a female and for this a 3 year good behaviour bond was imposed. In December 1974 he committed an indecent assault and again a 3 year good behaviour bond was entered into. In September 1983, and again in March of 1987 he committed offences against s547C of the Crimes Act of being near a building without reasonable cause with intent to peep or pry and in each case sentence was deferred upon him entering into a 2 year good behaviour bond. In August 1994, he was convicted of breaching a domestic violence order relating to his then wife. However in 1993 and 1994 the Prisoner was having matrimonial difficulties and I do not regard the offence committed that year as of any consequence for present purposes.80    The other offences are of relevance. The 1970 offence occurred when the Prisoner saw a woman wearing a short mini-skirt waiting in the street. He stopped his car and walked close enough to her to place his hand up her dress on her thigh. The 1974 offence occurred after the Prisoner saw a 24 and a 15 year old female from his car. He stopped the car, alighted and, at least for a time, followed them. He entered the front yard of the premises of the older woman, who was apparently wearing a light or see-through dress, then turned around, approached her, placed his hand under her dress and on her crutch and then ran off.81    The circumstances of the third offence were, according to the Prisoner, that while driving, he saw a woman in pyjamas or a negligee through a window of her residence. He stopped his car allegedly to go to the toilet. Seeing a light on in a flat he walked up the side of some property so that he could observe the woman inside. While watching he became sexually aroused and masturbated. The fourth offence was again a situation where the Prisoner had entered property because of an alleged need to urinate. 82    Following each of these offences the Prisoner saw psychiatrists although it would seem for the purposes of sentencing proceedings rather than treatment. After the first offence the Prisoner saw Dr Ellard who advised the Prisoner that if it happened again, he should find out the reasons behind his actions. After the second offence the Prisoner saw Dr Lucas who gave similar advice. Both doctors expressed the view that recurrence was unlikely, Dr Lucas saying also that he did not think the Prisoner would progress to a more serious offence. After the third offence the Prisoner saw a Dr Rumiz who recommended that the Prisoner consider seeking assistance. A condition of the bond given to the Prisoner after the fourth offence was that the Prisoner undertake counselling and treatment as required by the Probation and Parole Service. In fact the Prisoner saw a counsellor twice. 83    In evidence the Prisoner provided a number of excuses as to why he had not attended more often as had been required. Inter alia these included the demands of his work, and the movement of the counsellor whom he had seen into private practice which he said put her beyond his financial reach. However, like Dr Wong who gave evidence before me, I have no doubt that if the Prisoner had been motivated to pursue counselling he could have done so. He could not have been in any reasonable doubt that after 4 offences, he had a significant problem.84    There are a number of other matters to which I should refer. The Prisoner gave evidence that at the end of 1992 he commenced an affair. He told his wife about it in early 1993 and she then left home. A reconciliation was attempted in October of that year but was unsuccessful. The matrimonial home was sold in July 1995 and soon after the Prisoner went to live with his girl-friend at her parents’ home. Divorce proceedings were commenced in August 1995 and finalised in December 1995.85    Also during 1995 and 1996 the Prisoner was experiencing substantial problems with his sons who were then actively partaking of illicit drugs.86    His employment was terminated in late April 1996. I am prepared to accept the Prisoner’s evidence to the extent of concluding that this termination was at least influenced by factors other than matters referred to as misconduct and that he felt stressed and upset by the event. He then participated in part time work for 6 to 8 weeks. For something of the order of 15 years the Prisoner was involved to a significant extent in the Volunteer Bushfire Brigade, rising to the rank of Senior Deputy Captain.87    Since being incarcerated, all contact with his girl-friend has ceased, his father has died and it was felt that he should not attend the funeral. He has pursued a variety of courses in goal. As occurs with many sexual offenders, the Prisoner is in protective custody. 
     
      
       
       Psychiatric Evidence 
       
      
    88    Before me, evidence was called from 2 psychiatrists - in the case of the Crown Dr Wong and in the case of the Prisoner, Dr Westmore. Also placed before me were the reports of the psychiatrists I have previously mentioned. In his report Dr Wong, whose evidence overall, seemed to me much more persuasive that that of Dr Westmore concluded that “In summary, my opinion is that as things stand at the moment, there are sufficient negative prognostic pointers in the accused’s case to indicate very significant risks of re-offending.”89    Dr Westmore was not as concise. Inter alia he concluded that the Prisoner did not suffer from any mental illness or personality disorder although he did say that the Prisoner needed “extensive psychiatric assistance to clarify the aetiology of his sexual offending”. In light of the whole of Dr Westmore’s evidence I think he meant “determine” rather than “clarify”. Dr Westmore also indicated that the Prisoner tended to minimise his behaviour and showed an extraordinary lack or insufficiency of insight into the effect of his behaviour on his victims. More importantly in my view, he did not disagree with Dr Wong’s view as to the Prisoner’s prospects of re-offending. I should perhaps add that, having regard to the Prisoner’s record and the offences for which he falls to be sentenced, this conclusion is one I would have arrived at even in the absence of psychiatric evidence.90    Of course, recognition must be given to the fact that the Prisoner does not seem to have offended between March 1987 and December 1995 but in the absence of any satisfactory explanation for the Prisoner’s re-offending, that fact does not seem to me to deny a significant risk of further re-offending prior to, at least, a lengthy period of custody.91    In that regard, it was suggested by counsel for the Prisoner that the Prisoner’s re-offending was due at least in significant measure to a history of some early sexual abuse of the Prisoner by a cousin and stress imposed on the Prisoner by the finality of the breakdown of his marriage, by difficulties in his employment and problems with his children. Dr Wong seemed to accept that at times stress may be a precipitating cause for sexual offending. However, I remain unpersuaded that the earlier sexual abuse or the stress arising from these matters or the factors in combination were, in any material degree, different from those operating at other times when he was not offending. My impression is that Dr Wong was also sceptical in this regard but be that as it may, my conclusion is as I have stated it. Furthermore, I am disposed to accept the evidence of Dr Wong that the sexual abuse the Prisoner had suffered was unlikely to have been a significant contributing factor to the Prisoner’s offending and that without something ingrained and deviant the offences would not have been committed.92    Secondly, I am by no means satisfied that the Prisoner was entirely frank and accurate in his statement to Dr Wong and Dr Westmore. Indeed I would read into Dr Wong’s account of what the Prisoner told him of the current offences a significant minimisation of events. 
     
      
       
       Crimes Act and Sentencing Principles 
       
      
    93    I turn to the statutory provisions. Sections 61I, 61J and 61K of the Crimes Act provide:- 
     
      
       
        
         
         “61I Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and who knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse is liable to imprisonment for 14 years. 
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
         61J (1) Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and in circumstances of aggravation and who knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse is liable to imprisonment for 20 years. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         (2) In this section, “circumstances of aggravation” means circumstances in which: 
          
           
           (a) at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, the alleged offender maliciously inflicts actual bodily harm on the alleged victim or any other person who is present or nearby; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (b) at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, the alleged offender threatens to inflict actual bodily harm on the alleged victim or any other person who is present or nearby by means of an offensive weapon or instrument; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (c) the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (d) the alleged victim is under the age of 16 years; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (e) the alleged victim is (whether generally or at the time of the commission of the offence) under the authority of the alleged offender; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (f) the alleged victim has a serious physical disability; or 
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           
           (g) the alleged victim has a serious intellectual disability. 
           
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
         61K Any person who, with intent to have sexual intercourse with another person: 
          
           
           (a) maliciously inflicts actual bodily harm on the other person or a third person who is present or nearby; or 
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
           (b) threatens to inflict actual bodily harm on the other person or a third person who is present or nearby by means of an offensive weapon or instrument, 
           
          
         
         
         is liable to imprisonment for 20 years.” 
         
        
       
      
    94    The commencing point in any consideration of an appropriate sentence for a statutory offence is the statute itself. As was said in another context, “In determining the proper penalty … the fundamental consideration is rather the degree by which, having regard to the maximum penalties provided by the Act in question, the Respondent’s conduct would offend against the legislative objective of suppressing the illicit traffic in the prohibited drug” - R v Peel (1971) 1 NSWLR 247 at 262. The maximum penalty laid down by the legislature “is intended for cases falling within the worst category of cases for which the penalty is prescribed: Ibbs v R (1987) 163 CLR 447 - Veen v R (No. 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 478. 95    Clearly, all of the Prisoner’s offences fall well short of a “worst case” under s 61J or s 61K. Although circumstances of aggravation exist if only one of the sub-paragraphs in Sections 61J(2) is fulfilled, it is not difficult to envisage circumstances where more than one will be. Furthermore, the counts on the indictment particularise the circumstances of aggravation relied on as a threat to inflict actual bodily harm, a circumstance which I would regard as commonly less heinous than the actual infliction of the same harm. Although in recounting what occurred I have mentioned bodily injuries in fact suffered by some of the victims, these are of a minor nature and, given both the terms in which the charges are framed and the magnitude of the threat which there was in each offence, I do not regard the actual bodily injuries which occurred as aggravating to any significant extent the Prisoner’s criminality.96    In the Prisoner’s favour, it must also be recognised that his conduct, as distinct from his threats, was calculated to be less traumatic than many situations with which the court has to deal. In saying that, I wish merely to expressly recognise factors which the law requires be taken into account in judging where, on the scale of offences encompassed by the sections to which I have referred, his conduct falls. Regrettably, experience with in the Courts reveals depravity falling within the purview of sections 61(I) to (K) far, far worse in kind than that exhibited by the Prisoner. On the other hand, I do not for one moment underestimate the violation of the victims’ bodies which occurred nor the fear which his words or a knife against the throat were likely to engender. The Prisoner’s conduct was calculated to instil in at least some of his victims the fear of death with the concomitant loss of all that life holds, at least unless they bowed to his demands. Experience of life and experience within the courts demonstrate that not all persons readily recover from the traumatic events to which he subjected his victims. The victim impact statement of the fourth victim indicates that she has not.97    His conduct also imposed a significant risk on his victims. He created circumstances likely to be charged with emotion, and experience within and without the courts shows that there is but a fine line between a threat and a weapon on the one hand and injury or death on the other. Although an offender who crosses that line may lay him or herself open to further charges, it is important that the courts impose real sanctions to discourage the creation of the risk. Indeed the reference to “offensive weapon” in s61J(2) (b) makes it clear that this is one of the reasons behind the increased penalty provided for in s61J compared with s61I.98    It is necessary to bear in mind the legislative pattern revealed in the group of sections which I have quoted. Mere sexual intercourse without consent and with knowledge of that fact, but unaccompanied by any circumstances of aggravation renders an offender liable to imprisonment for 14 years. Ignoring any circumstances of aggravation, the objective circumstances of a number of the Prisoner’s offences were well up on the scale of conduct proscribed by s61I, albeit it must be acknowledged that matters such as the impact of an offence on a victim and the history and subjective circumstances of an offender have also to be taken into account99    I have already referred to the question of pre-meditation. The fact that all but the first one were subsequent offences is in the case of the other offences to my mind also an aggravating circumstance. (Here of course I do not use that phrase in the sense defined in Section 61J(2).) Having succumbed to whatever inclinations or temptations caused him to commit one or more offences, the Prisoner allowed to develop, or put himself in, a situation to commit the others. It may be it is too much to expect that he would have surrendered himself to the authorities after the first offence but there is no suggestion that having committed it, or indeed the later ones, he sought treatment for his situation. I do not regard a second or subsequent offence as more serious than a first only if an offender is detected prior to the later offences although the fact of such detection and its consequences and an offender’s response may themselves further aggravate a subsequent offence.100    Furthermore, particularly in light of his earlier offending, it must have been very apparent to the Prisoner, not later than the commission of the first of the offences with which I am concerned that he had a major problem with his sexual inclinations and self control.101    So far as the offences on the Form 1 are concerned, it must be recognised that no separate punishment for them can be given. They are merely to be taken into account in the determination of the punishment appropriate for the offence the subject of the third count in the indictment, the maximum penalty for that offence remaining 20 years imprisonment. On the other hand, as was said by Hunt CJ at CL with the concurrence of Allen J and Loveday AJ in Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 372 “it is wrong in principle that there should only ever be little by way of addition to the penalty imposed upon the offence charged when another offence is taken into account pursuant to s21” of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). Indeed, subject to the limits imposed by s 21 itself, it seems to me that there is no basis in the statute or in logic for imposing a lesser penalty for such offences if they are taken into account than would have been imposed had they been the subject of additional counts in the indictment.102    Of course the principle of totality must be borne in mind. “It is well established that in sentencing a person in respect of multiple offences, regard must be had to the total effect of the sentence on the offender” - Griffith v R (1989) 167 CLR 372 at 393. “When a custodial sentence is to be imposed which will be cumulative upon, or which will overlap with, an existing custodial sentence, the judge must take into account that existing sentence so that the total period to be spent in custody adequately and fairly represents the totality of criminality involved in all of the offences to which that total period is attributable."" - Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459 at 466. It is not simply a case of determining the appropriate sentence for each offence in isolation and adding all together. Furthermore, as I have said elsewhere - R v Spiteri [1999] NSWCCA 3 - “I take the view that actual imprisonment for, say 10 years is more than twice as severe as imprisonment for 5 years. … (the longer period) is likely to have an impact on an offender’s life in terms of wife, children, job prospects and the like from which he may well never recover”.103    Nevertheless, that said, it must also be recognised that one of the functions of punishment is the protection of the community, Veen v R (1987-88) 164 CLR 465 at 476, although this does not entitle the Court to impose a penalty by way of preventative detention going beyond the sentence appropriate to an offence - Veen at 473. 104    On this question of totality, there is one further matter to which I should refer. Even if I were wrong in my conclusion that the Prisoner’s criminality involved in each of the fifth to eighth offences included a practice of searching for victims, I would take the view that this practice is something I would be entitled to take into account against him in the course of reducing, pursuant to the totality principle, the penalties otherwise appropriate. There can be no doubt that this practice was part of the criminality of his offending. (Of course, it might not help the Prisoner if I concluded that his attacks were all spontaneous, uncontrolled or uncontrollable reactions to seeing a female in a vulnerable situation. The need of the community for protection from him would not obviously be less.)  
     
      
       
       Prior Authorities involving similar Offences 
       
      
    105    Statistics published by the Judicial Commission for the period January 1990 to July 1999 show that of 178 cases where imprisonment has been imposed for one count under s 61I, the median full term of imprisonment imposed has been 42 months and the median minimum or fixed term has been 24 months. Of 33 cases where there have been multiple counts, the medians have been 54 months and 36 months respectively. Combining these categories, the highest full term of imprisonment has been 10 years in one case and only 14 offenders received in excess of 7 years, half the statutory maximum. (In referring to these statistics, I do not overlook the fact that some of the periods have been rounded upwards.) Also one must recognise that, in the case of charges under sections 61(I) to 61(K), sometimes “multiple counts” reflect a number of acts of penetration on one occasion of only one victim.106    Comparable statistics for offences under s61J where, as has been said, the maximum period of imprisonment is 20 years, show that of 191 offenders sentenced to imprisonment for one count, the median full term has been 5 years and the median minimum or fixed term has been 3 years. Of these offenders, 1 received a sentence of 20 years, 3 of 16 years, and 15 in all received sentences exceeding 10 years. Of 70 offenders involved with multiple counts, the median full term has been 7 years and the median minimum or fixed term has been 4 years. Combining the categories, the longest sentences have been 20 years imposed in 2 cases and 25 offenders received sentences exceeding 10 years. 107    The statistics for offences under s61K(b) available to me cover the period March 1991 to July 1999 but relate to only 11 offenders. The corresponding medians are between 3 and 4 years (full terms) and 18 months.108    Devoid of detail concerning any individual case, these statistics can provide but a very rough guide but they do raise a question whether adequate attention has been paid to the significant increase in penalties provided by Parliament when those provisions of the Crimes Act dealing with sexual offences was substantially rewritten and penalties increased, effective from March 1991 - see R v Van Hung Truong (unreported, CCA, 8 December 1997).109    I have also considered a number of individual decisions. I have included as a schedule to these Reasons a summary of some of those to which I have been referred by counsel and some of the others to which I have had regard in arriving at my decision in the case of the Prisoner. Many, of course, have features not present in any individual offence of the Prisoner. Some are cases where the Court of Criminal Appeal has increased a sentence and that imposed will thus have been at the bottom of the range or less than should have been imposed at first instance. However it does seem to me that of the cases included in the schedule, Agafili, Cochrane, Cutmore, Dawson and Harvey support the conclusion that a total sentence of 6 years is within the range of sentences appropriate for the worst of the Prisoner’s offences, considered in isolation but taking account of his subjective circumstances. Brennan, Carroll, Gilbert, Hemsley, Hickey, Miller, Pratt, Rivera, Russell (December 1995) and Russell (June 1996) support the conclusion that a total sentence of 7 years is within that range.110    Given that the principle of totality will limit the total sentence to be imposed on the Prisoner I am content to proceed on the basis of these last mentioned cases although I should record that, judged by the terms of s 61I and 61J rather than by sentences in other cases, I would myself have thought that a sentence of longer than 7 years was appropriate for the worst of the offences committed by the Prisoner. 
     
      
       
       Conclusion 
       
      
    111    Having regard to what was said in Pearce v R (1998) 72 ALJR 1416 (see also DPP v Grabovac (1998) 1 VR 664 at 676-7) what I intend to do is to consider each case individually in the first instance, then to consider the minimum and total terms which seems to me appropriate to reflect the totality of the Prisoner’s criminality, and finally, structure the individual sentences so that those terms are not exceeded.112    If the first offence is considered in isolation, the sentence which seems to me appropriate is one the total term of which would be 5 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 3¾ years. Factors which distinguish this offence from some of the others are that it was the first offence in the series, and the only penetration was digital penetration of the vagina. 113    If the second offence is considered in isolation, the sentence which seems to me appropriate is one the total term of which would be 6 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 4½ years. Factors which distinguish this offence from some of the others are that the penetration of the vagina was both digital and penile. Also, the victim was relatively young - 17.114    If the third offence is considered in isolation, the sentence which seems to me appropriate is that indicated for the first offence, viz. one where there is a total term of 5 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 3¾ years. Factors which distinguish this offence from some of the others include the somewhat lesser degree of persistence, no evidence of more than minimal penetration but the victim was also relatively young - 18.115    If the fourth offence is considered in isolation, the sentence which seems to me appropriate is one the total term of which would be 6 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 4½ years. A factor which mitigates this offence compared with some of the others is the nature of the offence - inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse. Although the Crimes Act provides for the same maximum penalty as for the first 3 offences, and the Prisoner’s lack of success was largely due to events beyond his control, the physical components of this offence was less heinous than if he had succeeded. On the other hand an aggravating feature is that the psychological impact on the victim was severe and greater than apparent in the case of the other victims. But for this factor, I would have regarded lesser terms as appropriate but a severe psychological impact is well within the reasonably foreseeable consequences of actions against which s61K is directed.116    If the fifth offence is considered in isolation, the sentence which seems to me appropriate is one the total term of which would be 4 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 3 years. Some of the remarks made when dealing with the fourth offence apply here. 117    If the sixth offence is considered in isolation, the sentence which seems to me appropriate is one the total term of which would be 7 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 5¼ years. Factors which differentiate this offence from some of the others include the tying up of the victim, what seems to have been somewhat more or longer determination on the Prisoner’s part, more instances of penile-vaginal penetration, and, although the victim was older than some of the others, the impact upon her seems to have been greater than in some other instances.118    If the seventh offence is considered in isolation, the sentence which seems to me appropriate is one the total term of which would be 6 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 4½ years. Although fellatio was to the victim the least distasteful of the options presented to her, and Hunt CJ at CL in R v O’Donnell (unreported, CCA, 1 July 1994) has said that fellatio is less heinous than vaginal intercourse, I do not regard the differences between this offence on the one hand and the second on the other as inspiring a difference in penalty. Had I taken the view that the orifice used by the Prisoner did mean that the penalty for this offence should be less than that for the second offence, I would have regarded the second offence as deserving a higher penalty. This offence merits a total sentence of 6 years.119    If the eighth offence is considered in isolation, the sentence which seems to me appropriate is again one where the total term would be 6 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 4½ years. Although the nature and degree of penetration is less than in the case of some other of the offences, the victim was only 16. I should say more on that topic. Within the range of offences covered by s61J, all other things being equal - and I acknowledge they rarely, if ever, are - I would anticipate that the greater maturity which comes with age would make endurance of, and recovery from, an attack of the nature conducted by the Prisoner easier. Although Parliament has made an age of under 16 on the part of a victim itself a circumstance of aggravation, it does not seem to me that no distinction should be drawn between the likely situation of persons over that age. 120    In the case of the last 7 offences, I have given some weight - though I should say not great - to the fact that they were not first offences. However, consistently with treating the offences individually, I have otherwise ignored the Prisoner’s “continuing attitude of disobedience” or “dangerous propensity” as revealed by the number of offences he did commit - see Veen v R (No 2) at 477. Had I taken that factor into account, it would have lead me to increase the sentences beyond those indicated. However, given that the impact which the principle of totality has in this case, it seems to me unnecessary to further pursue these issues in respect of individual offences as opposed to taking account of them in determining the overall sentence.121    There is nothing in the circumstances of the individual offences to justify any of them being made concurrent. They were unconnected, except insofar as the Prisoner participated in each. However, the principle of totality requires that they be not simply accumulated. One must recognise that they are incidents in one course of criminality of the Prisoner and consider what penalty is appropriate for that. That inquiry raises a number of issues. It seems to me that one relevant question is whether his offences deserve a greater punishment than is commonly imposed for murder - see R v Sharrock [1999] NSWCCA 289. The Prisoner had 8 victims and although there was at least one instance of what I would regard as serious psychological damage, none of the victims lost their lives. On the other hand, his offences were premeditated and planned and in that respect, his criminality was worse than that of some instances of murder. It is appropriate also to recognise that his course of conduct is likely to have affected more people than his individual victims. Contemporaneous press reports of his offences are likely to have led to a number of persons at say, Artarmon, changing their pattern of life to avoid the risks his conduct created. The public are entitled to be protected, not only against the risks, but also against the fear which his type of conduct is calculated to engender. That said, I do not suggest that the Prisoner’s sentence should be extended beyond that appropriate to his crimes - see Veen v R (No 2) (1987-88) 164 CLR 465 at 473.122    The conclusion at which I have arrived is that the totality of the Prisoner’s criminality requires that a sentence of not less than 20 years, with a minimum term of 15 years be imposed. Given the nature and number of offences the Prisoner has committed, and the number of victims who have suffered at his hands, it does not seem to me that any lesser penalty is justified, particularly when one has regard to the maximum penalties provided by ss 61I, J and K. On the other hand, it must be recognised that the Prisoner’s offences all fell well short of the worst of their type. I do not regard his criminality as worse than that of many murderers who receive similar sentences, and if the Prisoner serves the longer of the periods I have mentioned, he will remain in prison until he is quite old, and there is a not unreasonable prospect that his sexual inclinations will have lessened. 123    I make it clear that it is the last two of these factors, and the enormity of terms of 15 and 20 years which have led me to limit the Prisoner’s sentence to these periods. I would adhere to these terms even if the appropriate sentences for individual offences were somewhat less than as indicated above.124    The nature of the Prisoner’s offences, the importance of rehabilitation, and the time he must serve in prison make it desirable that the additional term be lengthy. It seems to me appropriate that it accord with that normally imposed where the minimum term is 15 years. As I intend to impose some fixed terms and the additional term will be imposed in respect of an offence or offences where the minimum term will be less than 3 times that period, there are special circumstances within s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 125    I have not been referred to, and have not found, any case which is on all fours with this one. In any event the Court of Criminal Appeal has said on numerous occasions that the correct approach to sentencing does not involve merely a comparison of one case with another. However in coming to the conclusion as to what the Prisoner’s ultimate sentence should be I have again had regard to the statistics compiled by the Judicial Commission to which I have referred and to those cases in the schedule to these Reasons where there have been multiple victims or instances of offending.126    Despite the remarks in the immediately preceding paragraph, there is one case in the Schedule to which I wish to refer. It is R v Presta [2000] NSWCCA 40 where the effective sentence imposed was one of 19 years including a minimum term of 14 years and 3 months - both periods less than I regard as appropriate here. Although there were only 5 victims in that case as compared with 8 here, the extent of offending was in my view worse. I wish to make it clear that in my view, insofar as there may be inconsistency in the sentences imposed in that and the instant case, it arises because the sentence in R v Presta was lenient and probably unduly so. In the Court of Criminal Appeal Greg James J described the sentence in that case as “very lenient” and while Grove J said that the sentences imposed were entirely appropriate, those remarks must be considered in light of the fact that the appeal was by the offender, contending that the sentence was manifestly excessive.127    In order to effect the above conclusions, I decline to set a non parole period in respect of the offences the subject of the first, second and fourth counts of the indictment and the orders I make are as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
         
         1. In respect of the offence the subject of the first count of the indictment, the Prisoner is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 years and nine months commencing on the day of his arrest, viz 18 February 1997 and concluding on 17 November 2000. 
         
        
        
         
         2. In respect of each of the offences the subject of the second and fourth counts of the indictment, the Prisoner is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4½ years commencing on 18 February 1997 and concluding on 17 August 2001. 
          
          
         3. In respect of the offence the subject of the third count of the indictment, and taking into account those on the Form 1, the Prisoner is sentenced to imprisonment for 15½ years including a non parole period of 10½ years both such periods to commence on 18 August 2001. 
         
        
        
         
         4. The Prisoner will become eligible for parole on 18 February 2012 and entitled to release from custody on 18 February 2017. 
         
        
       
      
    128    In specifying the days on which the Prisoner will become eligible for parole and release, I have departed from the examples provided under s48 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which reflect a misunderstanding of either simple counting or the law’s measurement of time. Absent special circumstances, the law does not take account of parts of a day. Seven days’ imprisonment commencing on a Monday expires at midnight on the following Sunday. The person is entitled to be released immediately thereafter i.e. on the next Monday, not on the Sunday as the first example states. Whether for ease of administration the authorities choose to release such an offender on the Sunday is, of course, a different matter entirely. 
     
     R v Graham James KAY 
     
     
     SCHEDULE 
    In R v Agafili (unreported CCA, 1 May 1996) the Court of Criminal Appeal increased to a minimum term of 6 years with an additional term of 2 years a sentence imposed for sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation. Taken into account was another such offence and one of kidnapping. The victim had entered - whether voluntary or not was not determined - a vehicle containing the respondent and co-offenders. She was involuntarily detained in it for some 6 hours in the course of which she was raped vaginally and anally, escaped once, and had been forcibly dragged back to the vehicle.In R v Brennan (unreported, CCA, 29 May 1995) the respondent to a Crown appeal had been found guilty to 10 counts of aggravated sexual assault without consent and three counts of indecent assault. On the latter counts fixed terms of 2 years were imposed, to be served concurrently with sentences on the aggravated sexual assault charges. On these, concurrent minimum and additional terms of 3½ and 2½ years had been imposed. Carrying a butcher’s knife, the respondent had broken into the flat of the victim and subjected her to some hours of terror during which the offences, including fellatio and vaginal intercourse occurred. The respondent had kicked the victim, punched her, dragged her from one room to another and cut her deliberately.The respondent had a relatively clear record and had not been in prison previously. The offences were regarded as out of character and it would seem that alcohol abuse had played some part. The Court of Criminal Appeal increased the sentences on the aggravated sexual assault charges to include a minimum term of 5 years and an additional term of 2 years although Sully J, with whose Reasons the other judges agreed, said that at first instance a total sentence of 10-12 years including a minimum term of 7½ to 9 years would not have been excessive. But for some additional evidence as to the Respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation which was before the Court, the minimum term would have been 6 years.In R v Bus and AS (unreported, CCA, 3 November 1995), although there was no appeal against sentence the Court of Criminal Appeal said that the sentences imposed were within the applicable ranges. Each appellant had been found guilty of 2 counts of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation, viz. being in company, and one count of one of indecent assault. One victim was involved, she had had a sexual relationship or sexual intercourse with both offenders previously and all offences had occurred during one evening. The effective sentence imposed on Bus included a minimum term of 4 years with an additional term of 2 years although it is proper to recognise that 19 months of the minimum term was to be served concurrently with a sentence on a prior offence. Bus had a record for various dishonesty, driving and drug offences and was subject to a recognisance and a periodic detention order at the time of his offences. He was 20 at the time and some reduced weight was given to general deterrence in consequence of him having a very low IQ.AS was 17¼ at the time of the offences and accepted by the sentencing judge to have been immature. He had been sentenced to a minimum term of 2½ years and an additional term of 2 years.In R v Carroll (unreported CCA, 26 September 1995) the appellant was found guilty of aggravated sexual assault in consequence of inducing a victim to go to an isolated spot, hitting her such that she fell down, placing his hands on her throat and threatening to drown her and then having penile-vaginal intercourse without consent. The victim was left considerably affected psychologically and it was found this condition would continue. His sentence for this offence included a minimum term of 8 years penal servitude.While on bail for that offence he committed an offence of aggravated sexual assault on a woman who had invited him into her home. The victim suffered a number of injuries not detailed in the report. For this offence he was given a cumulative sentence which included a minimum term of 4 years penal servitude and an additional term of 2 years.These were the appellant’s first serious offences. The Court of Criminal Appeal thought the total excessive and varied one of the sentences so as to impose, effectively, a minimum term of 10 years and an additional term of 4 years.In R v Cochrane (unreported, CCA, 7 October 1998) The Court of Criminal Appeal held that a sentence including a minimum term of 4½ years with an additional term of 1½ years was well within the range of the trial judge’s discretion. The appellant was a taxi driver who, instead of driving his victim home took her to a deserted area where he attempted fellatio and then had penile-vaginal intercourse after cutting her underpants, placing a knife at her throat and threatening to kill her. He was convicted of one count of aggravated sexual assault.In R v Cutmore (unreported, CCA, 28 May 1999) the respondent to a Crown appeal had pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping and one count of aggravated sexual assault. He had abducted a 12 year old from her bedroom and taken her to a nearby showground. There was one incident of digital-vaginal penetration and one incident of fellatio and he threatened the victim that if she told any one he would come back and kill her. There was tearing of her hymen and into the muscle layer adjacent.The respondent was 22½ years with a long criminal history and on parole at the time. He was an aboriginal who had abused alcohol at an early stage of his life. Expressions of remorse were regarded as genuine. The sentence originally imposed included minimum and additional terms of 4 and 5 years respectively. The Crown did not contend that the 9 year period was inadequate but appealed against the minimum term. The Court changed the sentence to one including minimum and additional terms of 6 years and 3 years respectively.In R v Dawson (unreported, CCA, 19 May 1998) the appellant was found guilty on counts of (i) assault occasioning actual bodily harm, (ii) sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation, and (iii) sexual intercourse without consent. The aggravation consisted of holding a knife to the complainant and threatening to kill her if she screamed. Injuries she suffered included a loose tooth and extensive bruising. The appellant had had a sexual relationship with the complainant previously, which she had broken off although friendship continued. The offences occurred on the one occasion after the appellant broke into the complainant’s isolated home, woke her up with his hands around her neck and said “Prepare yourself to be bashed and raped tonight”.The appellant had no record of violence. He had a borderline personality disorder and was a heroin addict. He came from a dysfunctional home where he had been subjected to physical and psychological abuse. The Court of Criminal Appeal said that having regard to the totality of his criminality the sentences which had been imposed were appropriate. They were (i) penal servitude for a minimum term of 2 years with an additional term of 8 months, (ii) penal servitude for a minimum term of 5 years and an additional term of 1 year 8 months, and (iii) penal servitude for a minimum term of 3 years and an additional term of 1 year. The sentences were concurrent. The Court of Criminal Appeal also said “This Court has repeatedly stated that offenders who use knives in sexual crimes can expect to be sternly punished.”In R v Gilbert (unreported, CCA, 24 February 1994) the Court of Criminal Appeal reduced (by 1 year) to a minimum term of 6 years with an additional term of 2 years the effective sentence imposed on an offender who had grabbed an 18 year old victim from the street and taken her into adjacent toilets saying “I don’t want to hurt you or kill you - I just want to fuck you” and there committed a variety of indecencies upon her including fellatio, digital-vaginal penetration (twice) and penile-vaginal penetration. He had been convicted of 4 counts of sexual intercourse without consent and 2 of indecent assault. The victim had endured an hour of terror during which she feared for her life if she did not comply with the applicant’s demands. A report 15 months after the offences indicated that immediately after them the victim was seriously affected.The offender was of good character, had no criminal record, his inhibitions may have been reduced by the ingestion of alcohol and because he was a prison officer would suffer greater hardship than usual in prison. There was no weapon and no premeditation. In R v Hardy (unreported, Kirkham J, 27 November 1998), the offender was sentenced to an effective minimum term of 30 years and an additional term of 4 years and 8 months. His offences, to which he pleaded guilty were summarised by the judge as “twenty-nine serious offences, most of them violent sex offences, committed over a period of 6 months upon 10 people of both sexes and of varying ages and intellectual functioning”. In totality they rendered the offender liable to imprisonment for 462 years. Some 6 months prior to the first of the offences for which he was sentenced by Judge Kirkham he had been released from prison at the conclusion of some 9½ years imprisonment for similar offences.The offender was born in June 1956 and the minimum term will expire in September 2027, when he is 71.The offences against many of the victims followed a similar pattern and it will suffice if I summarise those against the first victim. He was a 16 year old boy who was induced to go with the offender into some bushes. There he told his victim he was a sex offender and to do what he was told or he would be killed. The boy started to struggle but the offender constricted the boy’s throat so he could hardly breathe. The offender then produced a knife. There was another threat of killing and the boy was forced to undress completely. The offender then committed fellatio on the victim and then forced the victim to do the same to him. The offender then put his fingers or penis into the victim’s anus and then his penis into the victims mouth. The Prisoner then masturbated to ejaculation. Evidence as to the effect on the victim of the offences showed, among other things, that he was very frightened of going into public places, suffered nightmares and poor impulse control and had developed a post traumatic stress disorder on top of a chronic psychosis. In R v Harrison (unreported, CCA, 20 February 1997) in a Crown appeal the Court increased a lower sentence which had been imposed at first instance. The facts are complicated.One group of offences occurred when the respondent picked up two hitchhikers, drove them to a secluded track, put a piece of string around the throat of one asking them whether they wanted him to hurt. The victim stabbed the Respondent. This conduct led to one charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and one of assault.In 1992 he picked up another hitchhiker who he threatened to mutilate and then kill with a knife, whom the respondent then caused to be handcuffed, perform fellatio more than once and with whom he had penile-vaginal intercourse. He subjected her to other gross indignities over a period of almost 7 hours. She suffered a substantial emotional reaction to her experiences. These events led to four charges of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent and one charge of sexual assault by forced self manipulation. He pleaded guilty to these offences and those arising out of the earlier incident.Two days later the respondent abducted another woman in Queensland and treated her somewhat similarly and with equal contempt. He was sentenced in Queensland in respect of his activities there. Then he was transferred to NSW and the Queensland sentence re-determined in this State as an effective total of 11 years and almost 4 months including a minimum term of 6 years. Then he came to be sentenced for the New South Wales offences to which I have earlier referred. He already had a criminal record for stealing, false pretences, stealing with violence whilst armed and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. There seemed to be some prospects of rehabilitation.In arriving at a sentence of a minimum term of 12 years and an additional term of 4 years the Court of Criminal Appeal took the view that the principle of totality required that there be imposed a total sentence for the NSW offences which, together with the re-determined sentence relating to the Queensland offences represented the totality of his criminality for all of the crimes in Queensland and in New South Wales for which he was in custody.In R v Harvey (unreported, CCA, 23 August 1996) the Court (by majority) allowed a Crown appeal and imposed a sentence including a minimum term of 4 years and an additional term of 2 years on one charge of aggravated sexual assault. The Respondent had broken into the house of his wife, from whom he was separated, after cutting the telephone wires and purchasing baby oil and carrying a knife. Having told her he intended to inflict pain upon her such as he was suffering, he followed her into the bedroom where he forcibly undressed her and, using the baby oil as a lubricant, had digital and penile-vaginal intercourse. The Respondent’s record disentitled him to leniency and he demonstrated no contrition.In R v Heather (unreported, CCA, 1 August 1995) this Court reduced to a minimum term of 9 years and an additional term of 3 years the effective sentence imposed for one count of kidnapping and 3 counts of aggravated sexual assault. The circumstance of aggravation was that the victim was aged 11. She had been walking past the offender’s home. He forced her inside and to undress. She was subjected to forcible penile intercourse and 2 separate instances of oral intercourse.The offender was 45 at the time of the offences and had prior convictions for robbery and assault prior to being sentenced in 1980 to 5 years penal servitude with an 18 month non-parole period of 2 counts of carnal knowledge of girls over the age of 10 and under 16 and attempted carnal knowledge of a girl under 10. The offender had also had multiple admissions to psychiatric hospitals. The basis on which the Court interfered was that the sentencing judge had made no allowance for the principle that general deterrence should be given less weight in the case of an offender suffering from psychiatric or intellectual disability than would otherwise be the case.Referring to R v Horvath (unreported, CCA, 6 February 1986), Studdert J said “a person who uses a knife in a sexual attack must expect stern punishment” and that the sentence imposed in the Court of Criminal Appeal was less than he would have regarded as appropriate at first instance.In R v Hemsley (unreported, CCA, 8 December 1995) the Crown case was that the complainant had been visited by the appellant and two others. The others left. The appellant then forced the complainant to submit to vaginal intercourse and then to perform fellatio. Early the next morning the appellant forced the complainant to submit again to vaginal intercourse and then left. He was convicted of 3 counts of sexual intercourse without consent and sentenced to a total of 9 years penal servitude, including a minimum term of 5½ years. Although there was no appeal against sentence Hunt CJ at CL with the concurrence of Smart and Studdert JJ said that there was nothing about the sentence to suggest it was otherwise than wholly appropriate in the circumstances.In R v Hickey (unreported, CCA, 27 September 1994) the respondent to a Crown appeal had been convicted of one charge of detaining a female with intent to hold her for advantage and of 2 counts of sexual intercourse without consent. The victim was 17 at the time. She was walking through a car park when grabbed by the respondent and led to a place where his activities were less likely to be observed. There he forced her to perform fellatio on him twice. On the second occasion he ejaculated in her mouth. The respondent was on parole at the time for 4 counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and on one offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse. Years earlier he had been convicted of 3 counts of rape.The respondent was a aborigine who had suffered substantial disadvantages in life. However the objective seriousness of the offences and other matters to which I have referred led the Court of Criminal Appeal to impose a sentence which included a minimum term of 4 years and an additional term of 2 years. That sentence was described as lenient and it was said that a minimum term at first instance could have ranged as high as 7 years.R v Jones (unreported, CCA, 15 December 1993) (There is some difficulty in relating the sentences imposed to the statement of the counts in the judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal and I have had recourse to the court file.) For offences of (i) sexual intercourse in circumstances of aggravation, viz. the infliction of actual bodily harm, (ii) the malicious of actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse, (iii) assault, (iv) assault, and (v) a second offence of sexual intercourse in circumstances of aggravation, viz. the infliction of actual bodily harm, sentences of (i) a fixed term of 6 years penal servitude, (ii) a fixed term of 6 years penal servitude, (iii) a fixed term of 1 years imprisonment, (iv) a fixed term of 1 years imprisonment and (v) a minimum term of 6 years and an additional term of 2 years penal servitude respectively were imposed. The first four sentences were concurrent, and the fifth cumulative on the first two. Thus an effective sentence of 12 years minimum term and 2 years additional term was imposed.The fourth and fifth offences involved the same victim. Different victims were involved in the other offences. The second to fifth offences were committed within hours of each other and the first offence some 3½ months earlier. The violence of Jones was somewhat worse than that of the Prisoner Kay. Jones had an appalling record and at the time of his offences he was on parole following earlier convictions for rape and similar offences. There was no evidence to suggest any prospects of rehabilitation and this, the Court thought, made understandable the shortness of the additional term. Putting aside an argument based on Jones’ life expectancy, the only attack on the length of the sentence was that the proportion between the fixed and minimum terms on the one hand and the additional term on the other indicated error. Not only was this argument rejected, but all the judges of the Court of Criminal Appeal were of the view that the sentences were appropriate.In R v Miller (unreported, CCA, 25 March 1997) the Court dismissed an appeal against a sentence including a minimum term of 7½ and an additional term of 3½ years on 6 counts laid under s61J of the Crimes Act and described in the report as either aggravated sexual assault without consent or aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. The applicant had seized a 16 year old girl without prior sexual experience while she was walking through a park and committed a number of indecencies upon her including digital-vaginal penetration, and 3 instances of fellatio. A little time afterwards the victim was described as screaming, crying and hysterical. The applicant’s record included, some 8 years earlier, a conviction from assaulting a person under 16 with an act of indecency for which he had been sentenced to 3 years penal servitude including a non-parole period of 12 months, 4 years earlier, entering a building with intent to commit a misdemeanour and an offence of indecent assault on which charges he had been sentenced to concurrent minimum terms of 14 months and additional terms of 4 months.The applicant was 35 years at the time, diagnosed as suffering from an anti-social personality disorder not normally responsive to psychiatric treatment and would be serving his sentence on protection. He had pleaded guilty but only during the course of a trial. There had been a prior sentence indication hearing, sentence, successful Crown appeal and withdrawal of the plea of guilty. In R v Pratt (unreported CCA 26 July 1996) the Court dismissed an appeal against a sentence consisting of a minimum term of 4½ years and an additional term of 18 months imposed for an offence of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation viz. the infliction of actual bodily harm. The victim had been on a “pub crawl”, she was the last passenger in a mini-bus and the applicant had taken the opportunity to grab her by the head, bash it hard against the bottom of the bus saying “I will knock you out if you want me to. We can do this the easy way or the hard way” and then had intercourse. He had no relevant record and the conduct was out of character. In R v Presta [2000] NSWCCA 40 the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed an appeal against an effective sentence of imprisonment for a minimum term of 14 years 3 months and an additional term of 4 years 9 months in respect of 5 counts of kidnapping and 21 counts of aggravated sexual assault. Again it will be sufficient to record the offences involving the first of the five victims as not untypical.A 15 year old boy was walking home from a party. He passed near the Appellant who produced what appeared to be a handgun. He covered the victim’s eyes, forced him into a car and drove him to the offender’s home. There he was tied to a bed with his arms and legs spreadeagled. He was given 5 or 6 tablets and an alcoholic drink to wash them down. He then passed in and out of consciousness. There, among other things, he was struck with a belt, and forced to commit fellatio and to lick the offender’s anus. The offender had anal intercourse with the victim and inserted a baton into the victim’s anus. The victim was then taken back to the motor car, driven away and thrown out. He was located, unconscious, by a passer by. Much of this activity was recorded by the offender on video. In R v Rivera (unreported, CCA, 19 February 1996) the Court dismissed an application for leave to appeal against sentences of a minimum term of 6 years and an additional term of 3 years and a concurrent fixed term of 4 years on 2 counts of aggravated sexual assault. The applicant had followed his victim out of an hotel, offered to walk her home. The offer seems not to have been accepted but he followed her and near a park grabbed her neck, took her inside the park and raped her twice, persisting in this activity to such an extent that after the police arrived he had to be bodily lifted from the victim. He was on a good behaviour bond for a prior offence of sexual attack and had two earlier convictions for offences of violence. Prior to his offences, he had suffered head injuries and brain damage in a motor vehicle accident but the court regarded these injuries and their impact on the Applicant as a two edged sword. They made general deterrence of lesser importance but the protection of society and the deterrence of the Applicant of greater importance, than might otherwise have been the case.In R v Roach (unreported, CCA, 29 September 1994) the applicant was found guilty of two charges of homosexual intercourse with a boy aged 7 - an offence which carried a maximum penalty of 25 years penal servitude. The offences arose out of the one occasion when the applicant was left alone with a child of a friend. In reliance on a review of prior decisions carried out in R v Moore (unreported, CCA, 12 April 1994) and on R v O’Donnell (unreported, CCA, 1 July 1994) the Court reduced the sentence from terms of 10 years and 3 1/3 years to minimum and additional terms of 8½ years and 2 years and 10 months.In R v Roberts (unreported, CCA, 8 August 1994) the applicant had been sentenced to terms aggregating 13 years including an additional term of 2 years for a series of offences consisting of 5 counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent and 4 counts of indecent assault. Using a knife he had forced his way into his victim’s house and there engaged over an extended period in, among other things, oral, vaginal and anal intercourse, urinated upon her and left her naked and bound. He had a substantial criminal record including an offence of threatening to inflict bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse. The Court of Criminal Appeal took the view that the trial judge had given insufficient attention to the proportion between the effective minimum and the additional terms and altered them to 10 and 3 respectively. Gleeson CJ with the concurrence of the other members of the Court,] said that the applicant’s conduct came close to being a worst case.In R v Russell (unreported, CCA, 15 December 1995) the applicant had sexual intercourse without consent with a girl he was walking home, and while on two recognisances. Shortly after his release on bail on that offence he, armed with a knife, approached a girl riding a bike in Redfern and forced her to a secluded area where he made her perform fellatio and had penile-vaginal intercourse with her. This incident led to one count for forcible abduction and two of aggravated sexual assault. Again released on bail, he was seen driving in a dangerous manner and sought to avoid arrest by forcing his vehicle against a police car.On the first charge, a fixed term of 3 years penal servitude was imposed. Arising from the second incident he was sentenced to a minimum term of 4 years penal servitude with an additional term of 4 years. The sentence consequent on his attempt to avoid arrest was a fixed concurrent term of 2 years.The applicant had a bad criminal record and was described as mildly intellectually handicapped. He also had a hearing disability and probably an associated learning deficit and immaturity. He was an aboriginal but, given the offences which he had committed, these matters were not regarded as entitling him to any significant discount. By majority, the Court of Criminal Appeal refused to interfere.In R v Russell (unreported, CCA, 21 June 1996) the respondent to a Crown appeal had knocked on the victim’s door while masked. When the door was opened he forced his way in, grabbed her in a head lock, hit her when she screamed and dragged her to the bedroom. After a number of unsuccessful attempts he achieved anal penetration but was unsuccessful in vaginal penetration. The charges were aggravated sexual assault without consent and attempted aggravated sexual assault without consent. The victim suffered bruising in a number of areas and post-traumatic stress disorder, finding herself unable to live alone, distrustful of others, particularly men and found it impossible to live her life, including work, as she had done previously.The respondent was 24, had an extensive criminal record since he was 12, six prior convictions for assault and assaulting police and was on parole at the time. He was aboriginal. Drug and alcohol seemed to have been involved.The Court said there was a degree of planning and pre-meditation. After referring to a number of cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal which showed a pattern of sentences ranging from minimum terms of 6 to 9 years following a plea of guilty to similar offences, the Court allowed the Crown appeal and imposed concurrent sentences including minimum terms of 5½ and additional terms of 2½ years.In R v Smith (unreported, CCA, 27 May 1996) the Court reduced the sentence for aggravated sexual assault from a minimum term of 4 years and an additional term of 2 years to one of a minimum term of 3 years and an additional term of 1 year. However the case was unusual in that the trial judge had made no relevant findings of fact and the Court of Criminal Appeal proceeded on the basis of only the facts implicit in the jury’s verdict i.e. digital penetration without consent and a threat with a knife. Subjective considerations were strong. The applicant was 54 and of unblemished prior character. He had been drinking prior to what was, for him, uncharacteristic behaviour.In R v Truong (unreported, CCA, 8 December 1997) the Court of Criminal Appeal increased to a minimum term of 2 ½ years and an additional term of 2 years the sentence imposed on a charge of under s61J. the respondent had forcibly had penile intercourse with the complainant while driving her home, the circumstance of aggravation being that the respondent was in the company of another. The Respondent had no prior convictions and there were other favourable subjective considerations. According to a victim impact statement the complainant had suffered trauma and been prescribed anti-depressant medication, presumably in consequence of the attack upon her. The Court said that the sentence reflected the fact of double jeopardy and should not be seen as providing guidance to primary sentencing judges.In R v Wap (unreported, CCA, 19 August 1996) the applicant went to the home of one victim, knocked and when the door was opened, brandished a knife and forced the occupant inside, then taking hold of the occupant’s wife. The occupant escaped, called for police assistance, and the appellant decamped. This conduct led to charges of entering a building with intent, and assault. The applicant then proceeded to the home of his second victim where he again knocked and the door was opened. By this time not only was he carrying a large knife but was disguised with a black stocking mask. He forced his way in to the house. There he committed a number of penile penetrations of each of the victim’s vagina and anus, penetration of her vagina with an aerosol can and his fist, and of her anus with a carrot, and fellatio.The applicant was 26 years at the time of his appeal with formidable criminal record commencing when he was 13 albeit there was only one earlier offence of violence and no prior sexual offences. The offences were committed within days of his release from custody and, one may infer, while on parole. To reflect his total criminality, he had been sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum term of 9 years and an additional term of 3 years. The Court of Criminal Appeal reduced the minimum term by one year for subsequent assistance to the prison authorities and, at least in part, in recognition that he would have to serve his sentence in strict protection.

      Fuzu ZHANG v REGIE NATIONALE DES USINES RENAULT SA and RENAULT AUTOMOBILES SA  
      
     
    The claimant, a New South Wales resident, suffered serious injuries in New Caledonia when he lost control of a Renault hire car he was driving. He brought an action framed in product liability in the Supreme Court of New South Wales against the opponents, two Renault companies being foreign companies.The claimant applies for leave to appeal against the decision of Smart J to grant a stay of the New South Wales action. If leave is granted, the parties were agreeable to the Court proceeding to hear the appeal. The claimant submits that in deciding that New South Wales is a clearly inappropriate forum in which to try the claimant’s action his Honour’s exercise of discretion miscarried by a misapplication of principle.The claimant submits that his Honour applied the test of a more or the most appropriate forum, rather than the correct test, found in Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd (1990) 171 CLR 538, of a clearly inappropriate forum.Smart J found that the practical considerations tended to favour News South Wales but that a stay should be granted on conditions. It is maintained that his Honour fell into error by attaching too much importance to the assumption that French law would be the substantive law to be adopted. 
    Held (Stein JA, Beazley and Giles JJA agreeing): 
    The lex loci delicti does not have a role to play after it has been used to determine the question of justiciability under the second part of the rule in McKain v R W Miller & Co (South Australia) Pty Ltd (1991) 174 CLR 1. The substantive law to be applied is the law of the forum; Thompson v Hill (1995) 38 NSWLR 714 applied.The discretion miscarried and it is appropriate to re-exercise it. Smart J should have held that the opponents had not discharged the onus of showing that New South Wales was a clearly inappropriate forum and refused the stay. 
     
     ORDERS 
     
    1. Leave to appeal granted.2. Appeal allowed with costs3. Set aside the judgment at first instance save the staying of the claimant’s claim in quasi contract, which was made by consent. 
    4. The stay sought by the opponents in the Summons before Smart J dismissed with costs.

      JUDGMENT 
      
    1    BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Stein JA. 
    2    STEIN JA: 
     
     Introduction 
      
    3    The issue before Smart J, the subject of the application for leave to appeal before the Court, is whether the Supreme Court of New South Wales is a clearly inappropriate forum in which to try the claimant’s action against the opponents. The opponents had sought a stay of the New South Wales action brought by the claimant. On 16 October 1998 his Honour granted a stay subject to certain conditions. His Honour’s decision involved the exercise of discretion which the claimant submits miscarried by a misapplication of principle. 
    4    The parties agree that the application for leave and the appeal (if leave is granted) should proceed at the same time. 
     
      
     Facts 
      
    5    The relevant facts may be briefly stated. The claimant, Mr Zhang, suffered serious injuries on 6 February 1991 at Poindimie in New Caledonia when he lost control of a Renault hire car which he was driving. It is convenient to adopt the facts found by Smart J. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
       The sedan travelled across the roadway, hit a 40 cm high earth embankment, somersaulted a couple of times, stopped on its roof, rolled over again and slid down a 30 metre high ravine towards the sea, coming to a standstill at the bottom of the ravine. The roof of the car was crushed into the passenger compartment. 
       
      
      
       
       The police investigation found that the Renault sedan was travelling at an excessive speed. There is evidence that the plaintiff ignored the speed signs and the signalling of roadworkers to slow down. One roadworker said that the Renault 19 skidded in the first bend and that he made vigorous signals to the driver to slow down. [at 1] 
       
      
    6    The opponents are two foreign corporations, Regie Nationale des Usines Renault SA and Renault Automobiles SA. For convenience his Honour referred to them as the Renault companies and I will do the same.  
    7    Although Renault had a previous presence in Australia, it appears that since some time in 1991 it no longer has any presence in New South Wales, apart from owning the Renault trade mark. (The distribution of Renault cars in Australia was apparently taken over by Volvo). 
    8    The claimant travelled to New Caledonia from Sydney in order to apply for permanent residency in Australia. This was subsequently granted and later he became an Australian citizen. While in Noumea, he hired a Renault motor vehicle from a car rental company. The claimant says that he hired a Renault sedan because he had previously driven them in Sydney and had acquired some knowledge of Renault motor vehicles. 
    9    As a result of the accident the claimant suffered a complete loss of motor power and sensation below T5 spinal level and will remain permanently paraplegic. It is common ground that he had suffered and continues to suffer damage in New South Wales, thus invoking Supreme Court Rules Part 10 rule 1A(e). 
     
      
     The claimant’s case 
      
    10    The claimant’s case against the Renault companies is framed in product liability. He maintains that Renault knew or ought to have known that its vehicles might be involved in accidents in which they might roll over. In that event, the likelihood of the roof crushing into the passenger compartment could be substantially reduced or eliminated if the roof and its structure were of sufficient strength. The claimant’s case was that the Renault companies were negligent in designing and manufacturing a vehicle which was defective. The defect was in the pillars and associated supports of the roof. They were of insufficient strength to prevent or substantially reduce crushing into the passenger compartment in an accident involving the car rolling over, as here occurred. 
    11    The claimant also relies on the opponents’ failure to warn him in New South Wales of the risk of roof crush if the vehicle rolled over. His Honour did not accept that there was any relevant failure to warn in New South Wales. I think that Smart J was correct to put this allegation aside for the reasons he gave.  
    12    The design and manufacture of the vehicle in question occurred in France. Accordingly, the alleged tort occurred in France. The consequential injury was suffered in New Caledonia. At the relevant time it appears that there was no French or European standard for roof strength. The opponents maintain that they used a US standard. The adequacy of the US standard will be in question in the proceedings. 
    13    The claimant’s three engineering experts in Australia maintain that: 
     
      
       
       … the car “roll over” phenomenon is well known and accounts for an appreciable percentage of accidents involving serious injuries or fatalities (5 to 10 per cent), that the Renault 19 sedan had a roof which was not of sufficient strength to withstand roll over damage and crushed too easily, that the cost per vehicle to provide a car roof of sufficient strength is comparatively small with estimates ranging from $20 to $300 and that if a roof of sufficient strength had been provided the plaintiff would probably not have been seriously injured. It has been assessed, with reasons in justification, that the Renault 19 sedan did not drop onto its roof from a height in excess of 0.5 metres. [Smart J at 5] 
       
      
      
     The first instance judgment 
      
    14    Smart J considered the ‘practical considerations’ of the trial venue. He noted that the claimant, his wife and son, his expert engineering witnesses, medical witnesses and other witnesses on assessment of damage, all resided in Australia. Expert witnesses for the opponents were likely to come from Europe or the United States. The witnesses to the accident, including before and after, would be important. Four reside in New Caledonia and one in France. While it might be possible to take their evidence on commission, they could not be compelled to attend in Sydney. 
    15    His Honour noted that the absence of discovery and interrogatories under French law placed the claimant at a disadvantage. Referring to the modest means of the claimant, his Honour noted that without solicitor and counsel acting for him on the basis of contingency fees, he could not afford to meet the costs of the action in New South Wales. Smart J added: 
     
      
       
       It is doubtful, to say the least, if he, a foreign national, could secure quality and experienced representation in New Caledonia or France in a case which has difficulties unless he made some payments. [at 9] 
       
      
    16    His Honour found that the litigation was likely to be expensive and the opponents had far greater resources than the claimant. They could afford to bring witnesses to Sydney and arrange for adequate legal representation and obtain a fair hearing. On the other hand, the claimant could not afford to pay for his witnesses to go to Noumea, New Caledonia. 
    17    As against these considerations his Honour noted that if the action was heard in France or New Caledonia on documentary materials, without oral examination, the cost would be greatly reduced. A court expert could be appointed to take evidence in Sydney. This aside, there was still the ‘difficult question’ of the claimant obtaining legal representation in France or New Caledonia. The opponents would still, according to his Honour, have a significant advantage. 
    18    The expert debate was likely to take the most time and was of general importance. The claimant’s driving at the time of the accident was also an important issue. 
    19    The languages of the witnesses was not seen as important because of the availability of interpreters. 
    20    His Honour stated that ‘[O]verall the practical considerations tend to favour a hearing in Sydney’ but added ‘if the case were to be determined by a French or New Caledonian Court mainly on documentary materials this would not preclude a fair hearing’. Nonetheless, there was, according to Smart J, still a problem for the claimant in obtaining adequate legal representation. 
    21    Having referred to Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd (1990) 171 CLR 538 and other authorities, Smart J concluded that: 
     
      
       
       This case has a close connection with France and New Caledonia. The design and manufacture of the sedan took place in France. If it were not for the accident in New Caledonia and the injuries suffered there by the plaintiff this claim would not arise. The New South Wales connection is of a different order. This is where his home is situated and where he has continued to suffer damage as a result of the accident and his initial injuries. That is a factor of relatively little weight ( 
       Voth  
       at 571). The system of law with which the plaintiff’s cause of action has the closest and most real connection is that of France. Both defendants are French companies and do not carry on business in Australia. A stay is not refused simply because a plaintiff can point to some connections with the local forum: see per Mason P in  
       Grigor 
       , supra at p 2 of his judgment. In  
       Voth  
       at 571 the High Court held that the overall task of the court is to exercise its discretion “based upon the competing connections of the respective forums with the subject matter of the proceedings.” [at 12] 
       
      
    22    His Honour then said that ‘[t]he substantive law to be applied is French law. On any reasonable view, the tort alleged, whether negligent design or manufacture, is French’. He said that the absence of legal aid would not of itself justify the refusal of a stay on the ground of forum non conveniens. He continued: 
     
      
       
       This case has a much closer connection with New Caledonia and France than with New South Wales. The case concerns a sedan allegedly defectively designed and manufactured in France by a French company, hired in a French Territory and involved in an accident in that same French Territory. France and New Caledonia have courts and procedures suited to this case and a judicial system of considerable standing which is internationally recognised and accepted. [at 16] 
        
       
      
    23    Nevertheless, the troubling aspect for his Honour was the claimant’s lack of funds to obtain justice. He said that the case was ‘very difficult’ but ultimately determined that a stay should be granted on conditions. These conditions were: 
     
      
       
       (a) The defendants submit to the jurisdiction of the Courts of New Caledonia; 
       
      
      
       
       (b) The defendants not raise and waive any defence based on a time limitation provision; 
       
      
      
       
       (c) The defendants not apply for security for costs or similar relief in respect of any action commenced by the plaintiff arising out of the accident and the design and manufacture of the car; 
       
      
      
       
       (d) The defendants meet the costs of any independent Court appointed expert. [at 17] 
       
      
    24    According to his Honour, condition (d) was designed to ensure that the claimant was not excluded from obtaining justice because of his lack of means. 
     
      
     The claimant’s submissions 
      
    25    It is the submission of the claimant that although his Honour referred to Voth, he did not apply it correctly when exercising his discretion. Rather, it is contended that he applied a test of a more or the most appropriate forum (Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd [1987] AC 460). 
    26    The correct principles to apply, so it is submitted by the claimant, are as follows: 
     
      
     (a) The claimant has a prima facie right to have his claim heard in New South Wales and this ought not be lightly displaced or denied, Deane J in  
     Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Co Inc v Fay  
     (1988) 165 CLR 197 at 241 and 243. 
      
      
     (b) As a corollary, the power to grant a stay must be exercised with ‘great care’ and ‘extreme caution’,  
     Oceanic  
     at 247 - 248 and  
     Voth  
     at 554. 
      
      
     (c) A stay should not be granted unless New South Wales is shown to be a clearly inappropriate forum, and the onus to show this is on the opponents,  
     Oceanic  
     at 247 - 248,  
     Voth  
     at 564 - 565. 
      
      
     (d) Even if another forum was more appropriate, this would not, of itself, be a sufficient ground for a stay,  
     Oceanic  
     at 248 and  
     Voth  
     at 570. 
      
      
     (e) A local court would be a clearly inappropriate forum if the proceedings would be oppressive in the sense of seriously and unfairly burdensome, prejudicial and damaging,  
     Oceanic 
      at 247 and  
     Voth  
     at 564. 
      
      
     (f) Notwithstanding that the Australian test is not the same as in English law, the factors referred to by Lord Goff in  
     Spiliada  
     provide valuable assistance,  
     Voth  
     at 565. 
      
     Discussion 
      
    27    It is convenient at once to dispose of one of the claimant’s submissions. In the opening paragraph to his reasons for judgment Smart J referred to the issue as whether New South Wales was an ‘inappropriate forum’. He did not use the phrase ‘clearly inappropriate forum’. I do not read anything into this. His Honour could well have been referring to Part 10 rule 6A(2)(b) and, later in his judgment it is obvious that his Honour was well acquainted with the common law test. I am satisfied that Smart J was aware of the impact of the adjective ‘clearly’, and it has been held that the rule does not relax the common law test. See for example W F Motors Pty Ltd v Maydwell (Supreme Court, 23 April 1993, unreported) and C E Heath Underwriting & Insurance (Australia) Pty Ltd v Barden (Supreme Court, 19 October 1994, unreported). 
    28    The claimant submits that Smart J did not apply the correct test in Voth (at 571) but something more akin to Spiliada, see Mason P in James Hardie Industries Pty Ltd v Grigor (1998) 45 NSWLR 20 at 41 for a discussion of the differences. Essentially the discretion exercised by Smart J is said to have miscarried by his Honour concluding that a stay should be granted to the opponents, having found that the practical considerations tended to favour New South Wales. In particular, it is maintained that his Honour fell into error by attaching too much importance to the assumption that French law would be the substantive law to be applied. This finding, so it seems, outweighed the practical considerations which were found to favour New South Wales. Indeed, it appears to me to have been decisive in the exercise of the discretion, the discretion being otherwise finely balanced. 
    29    The claimant further submits that it was an error to positively find that the substantive law to be applied by the New South Wales Court would be French law. The claimant submits that the lex loci delicti does not have any role to play after it has been used to determine the question of justiciability under the second part of the rule in Phillips v Eyre (1870) LR 6 QB 1. Although acknowledging the differences of judicial opinion which exist, Mr Margo, on behalf of the claimant, relies on the analysis of Clarke JA (Kirby P agreeing) in Thompson v Hill (1995) 38 NSWLR 714. 
    30    Clarke JA (at 734) noted that if a plaintiff sues in a New South Wales court to recover damages for a tort committed outside the State, three questions may arise. These are: 
     
      
       
       1. Does the New South Wales Court have jurisdiction? This is not in dispute in the subject case.  
       
      
      
       
       2. Are the proceedings justiciable in a New South Wales Court? This involves the application of the common law principles of conflict of laws applying in New South Wales. 
       
      
      
       
       3. If there is jurisdiction and justiciability in New South Wales, what law should it apply? 
       
      
    31    His Honour noted that the question of justiciability is often described as the ‘threshold question’. The distinction between justiciability and the last question of what law is to be applied, is significant. Clarke JA referred to the discussion of the distinction in Breavington v Godleman (1988) 169 CLR 41 by Mason CJ and Brennan J. The threshold view of justiciability had been adopted by this Court in Kolsky v Mayne Nickless Ltd (1970) 72 SR (NSW) 437 at 444 and also Walker v W A Pickles Pty Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 281 at 289.32    Clarke JA concluded that no decision of the High Court doubted the correctness of the rule. It followed that once the threshold question had been answered, the law of the lex loci delicti ceased to have relevance. 
    33    His Honour examined McKain v R W Miller & Co (South Australia) Pty Ltd (1991) 174 CLR 1 wherein the majority found that the plaintiff may sue in the forum with respect to a wrong occurring outside the forum if (a) a cause of action would have arisen entitling the plaintiff to enforce against the defendant a civil liability of the kind which the plaintiff claims to enforce; and (b) by the law of the place in which the wrong occurred, the occurrence gave rise to civil liability of the kind which the plaintiff seeks to enforce. See also Stevens v Head (1993) 176 CLR 433. 
    34    Of McKain Clarke JA said (at 740 - 741): 
     
      
       
       Earlier I referred to the question whether the substantive law of the place of the tort is imported into the law of the forum solely for the purposes of the second rule in  
       McKain  
       or whether it is imported for all purposes. The question arises in this case because of the form of the questions submitted. I earlier indicated that prior to  
       Breavington  
       the weight of authority supported the view that the substantive law of the place of the tort was imported only for the more limited purpose. In  
       Breavington 
       , Mason CJ accorded primacy in all respects to the substantive law of the place of the tort and, obviously, that view involved the importation of the law of the place of the tort into the forum for the determination of the issues which arose there. His opinion on the question with which I am now dealing was supported by Brennan J who said (at 110): “The two conditions are not merely the criteria of the forum’s jurisdiction; they state the substantive law which governs a plaintiff’s right to recover a judgment in respect of an extra-territorial wrong.” This view was not, however, shared by Dawson J and Toohey J: see at 142-143, 145 and 160-161. 
       
      
      
       
       Because, however, there was not a clear majority in favour of the application of the  
       Phillips v Eyre  
       rule it seems to me that  
       Breavington  
       can not be considered to have over-ruled the principle supported by the balance of authority.  
       McKain  
       stands in a different situation for there was in that case a clear majority in favour of the modified  
       Phillips v Eyre  
       rule but on the question I am considering there was no express statement of opinion. That is, perhaps, not surprising for there had previously been divided views among the majority on the question. On the other hand the discussion concerning the concession, to which I earlier made reference, evidences the judges’ concentration on the second limb of the  
       Phillips v Eyre  
       rule. 
        
       
      
    35    Clarke JA noted that it had not been suggested by the majority in McKain or Stevens that the earlier view concerning the limited effect of the substantive law of the place of the tort was wrong. Clarke JA accordingly saw no justification to depart from Walker v W A Pickles and Kolsky and held that the substantive law of the place of the tort is only relevant for the purposes of the second limb of the rule in McKain.  
    36    Support for Clarke JA’s approach is to be found in Nalpantidis v Stark (1995) 65 SASR 454, although the Victorian Court of Appeal differed in Wilson v Nattrass (1995) 21 MVR 41. 
    37    In James Hardie & Co Pty Ltd v Hall (Putt) (1998) 43 NSWLR 554, this Court referred to Thompson v Hill uncritically, see Sheller JA at 577 - 579, although without express reference to the present question. Thompson v Hill does not appear to have been drawn to the Court’s attention in Grigor although the Court found that it was not satisfied that New South Wales was a clearly inappropriate forum. 
    38    I find Clarke JA’s reasoning in Thompson v Hill to be most persuasive. Kirby P agreed with his Honour’s proposed answers to the questions (at 731). It built on Kolsky and Walker v W A Pickles, which have not been overruled. It has not been contradicted by any High Court decision. In an illuminating analysis of the case law, Clarke JA’s reasoning in Thompson v Hill is supported by Sackville J in Mason v Murray’s Charter Coaches and Travel Services Pty Ltd (1999) 159 ALR 45 (see also Higgins J). Thompson v Hill also derives support from Hunt J in Lazarus v Deutsche Lufthansa AG (1985) 1 NSWLR 188 at 190 and Dawson J in Gardner v Wallace (1995) 184 CLR 95. See also Gummow J in David Syme & Co Ltd v Grey (1992) 38 FCR 303 at 324.9. For an academic discussion of the issues see M Davies, ‘Exactly what is the Australian Choice of Law in Torts cases?’ (1996) 70 ALJ 711; S Dutson, ‘Choice of Law in Tort in Domestic and International Litigation’ (1998) 26 ABLR 238; F K Juenger, ‘Tort Choice of Law in a Federal System’ (1997) 19 SydLR 529. 
    39    Mr Margo submits that it is fairly arguable that the substantive law to be applied at the hearing will be New South Wales law. Smart J did not need to determine that question on the stay application and should have left it to the trial judge. It is maintained that his Honour’s assumption to the contrary, and his giving it such great weight, caused the discretion to miscarry. In this respect, reliance is placed on Gaudron J’s statement in Oceanic (at 266) to the effect that if it is fairly arguable that the substantive law of the forum is applicable, then the selected forum should not be seen as an inappropriate one. In any event, the quantum of the claimant’s damages would be determined in accordance with the law of the forum. Even if the hearing were to take place in France or New Caledonia, it is possible that an inquiry into damages might take place in New South Wales. 
    40    It is clear that the opponents did not suggest to Smart J that the tort of negligent design and manufacture was not justiciable in New South Wales or that both limbs of Phillips v Eyre, as restated in McKain, were not satisfied. Accordingly, it was unnecessary to apply French law to arrive at justiciability and his Honour can not have been referring to that when he said that the substantive law to be applied was French law. Applying Thompson v Hill and earlier authorities in the Court, Smart J should not have taken into account in the exercise of the discretion that a New South Wales court would apply French law as the substantive law to determine the issue of liability. 
    41    It is not my understanding of Voth that it held that the lex loci delicti will be applied by the local court as the substantive law for the determination of liability of a foreign tort. Indeed, the majority said (at 569) that the precise role of local law under the double actionability rule in Phillips v Eyre did not need to be explored. 
    42    As I have said, Smart J found that ‘[t]he substantive law to be applied is French law’. This finding was not merely for the purpose of the second limb, justiciability, in the McKain test (since justiciability was not in issue). It was a finding that French law would determine liability as the substantive law to be applied. I am satisfied that the succeeding paragraph of the judgment confirms this to be so. The finding was an unnecessary and arguably premature ruling, if not incorrect. As has been discussed, it is arguable, applying Thompson v Hill, that the substantive law to be applied would be that of New South Wales.  
    43    In these circumstances, did his Honour’s finding on the substantive law to be applied infect his discretion causing it to miscarry? It is clear from his reasoning that his Honour placed great weight upon French law being the substantive law to be applied by the New South Wales court. Indeed it seems that it was the decisive matter which determined the exercise of the discretion, his Honour having earlier said that practical considerations tended to favour a hearing in Sydney. A fair reading of his Honour’s reasons reveals that he saw the question as very finely balanced. The balance was clearly tipped in favour of the opponents by the finding of the substantive law to be applied. In my opinion, the discretion miscarried.  
     
      
     Re-exercise of the discretion 
      
    44    Accordingly, it is appropriate to re-exercise the discretion. His Honour was right to conclude that the practical considerations favoured New South Wales. All of the claimant’s witnesses reside here. There are up to four witnesses in New Caledonia, which is much closer to Sydney than France. Their evidence could be taken on commission or by video link. The police officer is now resident in France. It is unclear whether his evidence is necessary. The expert witnesses for the opponents are likely to be from Europe or the United States, but given the resources of the opponents, this does not weigh heavily in the balance. By comparison, the claimant has no means to pay the costs of witnesses going to France or New Caledonia. 
    45    In a product liability case in NSW the claimant would have a legitimate juridical advantage in the ability to cross-examine expert witnesses, not available under the civil law system in France or New Caledonia. Equally important is the juridical advantage of the availability of discovery, inspection and interrogatories in NSW, not available in France or New Caledonia. 
    46    The claimant’s modest resources mean that he cannot afford to pursue his action in NSW except on a contingency fee basis. He would, according to his Honour, be unlikely to secure quality and experienced legal representation in France or New Caledonia because of his means. Smart J acknowledged that this would give the opponents a significant advantage. 
    47    It may be pointed out that neither party has any particular connection with New Caledonia. The claimant had only a transitory and accidental connection. The alleged tort did not occur there. Except as some sort of geographic compromise, I am unable to see how New Caledonia can be seen as an appropriate forum. 
    48    It has not been demonstrated that a trial in NSW would be oppressive in the sense of ‘seriously and unfairly burdensome, prejudicial or damaging’, or vexatious to the opponents (Henry v Henry (1996) 185 CLR 571 at 587). I do not see how the opponents would not obtain a fair trial here. It ought not be concluded that NSW is a clearly inappropriate forum. 
    49    In my opinion, Smart J should have held that the opponents had not discharged the onus of showing that New South Wales was a clearly inappropriate forum and refused the stay. 
     
      
     Postscript  
     Pfeiffer 
      
    50    After judgment in this matter was reserved the High Court delivered its decision in John Pfeiffer Pty Limited v Rogerson [2000] HCA 36 (21 June 2000). With leave the parties made supplementary written submissions. 
    51    Pfeiffer establishes that the lex loci delicti, rather than the law of the forum, is the governing law with respect to torts committed in Australia but which have an interstate element (intranational torts). The High Court has developed the common law by reference to the Constitution (s 118 and Chapter III) to take account of the fact of federal jurisdiction and the nature of the Australian federation. The joint judgment expressly limits its discussion to issues arising in respect of intranational and not international torts, see paras 2 and 102. See also Kirby J at 153. 
    52    Counsel for the opponents submit that Pfeiffer provides powerful reasoning for the lex loci delicti as the choice of law in international torts, and that McKain and Stevens are no longer good law in Australia. The claimant however rightly indicates that, along with the double actionability rule, those cases presently continue to be relevant for international torts. 
     
     Orders 
      
    53    Leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal allowed with costs. It is appropriate to set aside the judgment at first instance save the staying of the claimant’s claim in quasi contract, which was made by consent. The stay sought by the opponents in the Summons before Smart J should be dismissed with costs. 
    54    GILES JA: I agree with Stein JA.

      REGINA v Barry Clifford DOUGLAS 
      
    The appellant was indicted on 17 counts including weapons offences, armed robbery and malicious infliction of actual bodily harm. He pleaded not guilty and was tried before a District Court Judge and jury. There was a directed verdict of not guilty in relation to the fourth count. The appellant was found guilty on the remaining counts. A series of concurrent sentences was imposed, the longest being a sentence of 16 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 12 years. On the day of his arrest, 28 May 1997, the appellant participated in two lengthy ERISPs at Penrith Police Station. He made full admissions in relation to firearm offences at Penrith and also in relation to several robberies on the northern beaches which became the subject matter of eight of the counts in the indictment. On 12 June 1997 there was a further ERISP at Maroubra Police station during which the appellant made admissions as to several other robberies which became the subject of the other counts in the indictment.This appeal against conviction raised two grounds, namely: · Evidence of the admissions made during ERISPs on the day of the arrest should have been excluded;· The trial judge was in error when he failed to grant the appellant’s application for separate trials.Of the first ground, after a lengthy voir dire the trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence that he agreed to make the ERISP admissions because of a deal involving the manner the police would treat his de facto wife and the other girl living at the appellant’s house. On appeal (and not at trial), the appellant complained of the trial judge’s failure to make findings based upon a conversation which the appellant said he took to amount to a refusal to permit him to have access to a lawyer. An investigating detective told the appellant that he was not permitted to make a phone call, due to evidence the subject of a search warrant being possibly removed or tampered with as a result of such a call. Of the second ground, the appellant at trial applied to have each count in the indictment tried separately. His Honour accepted that the real issues in the trial were so intrinsically interlinked that it would be extremely difficult to extract the events of each count from the various electronically recorded interviews and the listening device recordings. He held that no valid basis had been established by the appellant for ordering separate trials. HELD (by Mason P, Sully and Sperling JJ agreeing) dismissing the appeal against conviction: Of the first ground, s84(1) of the Evidence Act did not require the rejection of the Penrith ERISPs. This was not a situation where the will of the appellant in custody was broken down by improper pressure or unfair conduct. The conduct of the police was not “oppressive, inhuman and degrading”. There was nothing to support the submission that the discussion “influenced” the appellant to confess; and the case was not run this way at trial. Everything points to the unlikelihood that the truth of the admissions was adversely affected. There was no issue as to the reliability of the admission under s85. Of the second ground, the trial judge did not err in the exercise of his discretion in light of the grounds advanced at the time, nor did his ruling lead to any miscarriage. At the time the application was made there was no suggestion that the admissions in the ERISPs were unreliable. The only issue in the robbery charges was identity and the ERISPs contained full admissions as to the appellant’s participation. The Crown had made it clear that it would not be running the trial on the basis that the robberies could be linked through similar fact evidence. The jury were given repeated directions to the effect that each count was to be considered separately. There was little risk of prejudice in this case by running the trials concurrently.R v Truong (1996) 86 A Crim R 188 (distinguished); The Queen v Swaffield (1998) 192 CLR 159 (distinguished); Clarke (1997) 97 A Crim R 414 (referred); R v Guldur (1986) 8 NSWLR 12 (referred); R v Verma (1987) A Crim R 441 (referred); Sutton v The Queen (1984) 152 CLR 528 (referred); De Jesus v The Queen (1986) 61 ALJR 1 (distinguished); Reg v McDonald (1979) 21 SASR 198 (followed).

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1    MASON P: The appellant was indicted before Judge Armitage QC at the Sydney District Court on 9 September 1998. There were 17 counts: 
     
     • Counts 1-3 related to weapons offences at Penrith on 28 May 1997 
      
     • Count 4 became the subject of a directed acquittal 
      
      
     • Counts 5-9, 11-13, 15-17 related to a series of robberies at knife point in early 1997 ( 
     Crimes Act 
     , s97(1)) 
      
     • Count 10 related to a February 1997 robbery at Epping which was followed by malicious infliction of actual bodily harm ( 
     Crimes Act, 
      s94). Very late in the trial this count was amended to one of robbery being armed with a knife, like the earlier counts. 
      
     • Count 14 related to an April 1995 robbery, being armed with a double barrelled shotgun ( 
     Crimes Act 
     , s97(2). 
      
    2    The appellant pleaded not guilty and was tried before his Honour and a jury. As indicated there was a directed verdict of not guilty in relation to the fourth count. The appellant was found guilty on the remaining counts. 
    3    A series of concurrent sentences was imposed, the longest being a sentence of 16 years imprisonment with a minimum term of 12 years in relation to the 14th count. 
     
      
     Summary of trial 
      
    4    The Crown case may be summarised as follows. 
    5    In March 1997 Peter Bannerman, whilst being questioned by the police in relation to other matters, agreed to assist the police regarding a number of armed robberies, some of them involving the appellant. On 26 May 1997 Bannerman tipped off the police about a robbery being planned with the appellant. The police arranged surveillance and installed listening devices. The appellant was arrested on 28 May 1997 in possession of the weapons which were the subject of the first three counts in the indictment, one of them being a sawn-off shotgun. 
    6    On 28 May 1997 the appellant participated in two lengthy recorded interviews (ERISP) at Penrith Police Station. He made full admissions in relation to the firearms offences at Penrith and also in relation to several of the robberies on the northern beaches in early 1997 which became the subject matter of at least eight of the counts in the indictment. On 12 June 1997 there was a further ERISP at Maroubra Police Station during which the appellant made admissions as to several other robberies which became the subject of the other counts in the indictment. 
    7    The ERISP transcripts contain the customary cautions, frequently repeated. At the end of each record of interview there was the customary acknowledgment that there had been no threat, promise or offer of advantage. 
    8    At the trial, the Crown evidence included the products of listening device warrants and videos relevant to the three weapons offences at Penrith; video cassettes and ERISP transcripts relating to the interviews; and witness statements from the victims of the various robberies. The latter deposed as to the circumstances of the offences without positively identifying the appellant, although sometimes giving descriptions of an offender that were consistent with the appellant’s description. The appellant’s co-offender Bannerman, who had assisted police investigations by wearing a listening device and by other means, also gave highly incriminating evidence.  
    9    The appellant gave evidence in which he effectively admitted the firearms offences of 28 May 1997, albeit asserting that Bannerman was the instigator of those offences. He said nothing about the other charges and refused to be cross-examined about them. He did not deny the ERISP interviews or cast any doubt on their reliability. 
    10    The appellant’s de facto wife, Leslie Brown gave evidence to the effect that she had never seen the appellant with a gun. She also painted Bannerman as the instigator of the robbery planned for 28 May 1997. 
    11    The appellant was represented at trial by Mr Bruce Miles, an experienced solicitor. 
    12    This appeal against conviction raises two grounds, namely: 
     
     • The trial judge was in error when he failed to grant the appellant’s application for separate trials; 
      
     • Evidence of admissions made during the electronic records of interview should have been excluded. 
      
    13    There is no challenge to the summing up. It is therefore relevant to the first ground of appeal to observe that the summing up contained repeated strong admonitions that the jury weigh up and consider separately the evidence in respect of the 16 counts.  
    14    The jury were taken through the evidence relating to the various robberies in early 1997. They had taken place at shops, bottle shops and a post office in the northern beaches area. There was practically no dispute about the circumstances of the individual robberies. The victims did not give evidence and their statements were tendered without objection. The jury were directed that the statements of the robbery victims were insufficient to identify the appellant and that the Crown case on identification depended essentially upon Bannerman’s evidence and the ERISP evidence. 
    15    Bannerman had given evidence that he had assisted the appellant in five of the robberies and in the preliminaries leading up to the events at Penrith on 28 June 1997. He had been granted immunity. Accordingly, an accomplice direction was given. 
    16    As to the ERISP evidence, the jury were reminded that the appellant had not denied making the admissions and had not contended that they were unreliable. They were also told that the appellant’s refusal to answer any questions relating to the robberies was quite unjustified. The jury were also warned that the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the admissions were made and that they were reliable. This lastmentioned direction was repeated at the request of the appellant’s legal representative after the jury had first retired.  
    17    No complaint is made about the directions. 
    18    At the start of the trial the appellant’s solicitor applied for separate trials. However, it was agreed that it was more appropriate that the application to exclude Bannerman’s evidence and the ERISP evidence should be determined first. For that reason I shall address the grounds of appeal in reverse order. 
     
      
     Ground 2: Evidence of admissions made by the appellant during an electronic record of interview should have been excluded. The investigating police had led the appellant to believe that he was not able to contact any person, including a lawyer, while the interview was proceeding. 
      
    19    There was a lengthy voir dire hearing immediately after the presentation of the indictment and the taking of the not guilty pleas. Several matters were in issue. The appellant sought to exclude the ERISP admissions, Bannerman’s evidence and evidence obtained by means of the listening devices. 
    20    The application was rejected on 15 September 1998. Judge Armitage gave reasons which span 15 pages. 
    21    As recorded in the judgment: 
     
      
       
       The basis of the application is that the evidence was obtained unlawfully and unfairly. It is contended by the accused that for the purpose of making the accused vulnerable, the police engineered the commission of a crime and caused the informant to take active steps to involve the accused in that crime. As a result of that the accused was apprehended in respect of that crime, and admissions in respect of that matter, and several other matters, were obtained from him. 
       
      
      
       
       It is further contended that evidence of oral admissions made to the informant, Mr Bannerman, were obtained unlawfully and unfairly by disregarding the accused’s right to silence. The onus of proving that the accused was not influenced by the police to make admissions by being told that if he did not make them his wife would or might be charged, is an onus borne by the Crown on the balance of probabilities. 
       
      
      
       
       As to the unlawful and unfair conduct on the part of the police alleged by the accused in respect of the engineering of a crime, and the disregarding of his right to silence, the onus is upon the accused to prove those matters on the balance of probabilities. 
       
      
      
    22    Evidence had been given on the voir dire by the appellant, his wife, two police officers and Mr Bannerman. Much of the evidence and of the findings in the judgment relate to matters no longer in issue, especially the so-called entrapment issue involving Bannerman. The passage set out above also discloses that the appellant sought to have the ERISP admissions excluded because they stemmed from the police telling him that if he did not make them his wife would or might be charged. It is very clear from the evidence and the judgment that Bannerman’s involvement and the threat involving the appellant’s wife were the principal bases upon which the ERISP admissions were sought to be excluded, for various legal reasons. 
    23    These attacks on the ERISP admissions failed and there is no complaint on this account.  
    24    It is unnecessary to recount the judge’s reasons for rejecting the attack as related to Bannerman. However, the findings referable to the impact of the appellant’s fears for his wife need to be examined in a little detail, because they form a back-drop to the challenge to the ERISP admissions that is pressed in this Court. 
    25    Certain matters were not in issue or are no longer in issue. 
    26    The appellant was arrested at about 4.05pm. The first ERISP started at about 8.12pm. A search warrant was executed at the home of the appellant and his wife at approximately 8.40pm. The first ERISP concluded at 9.20pm and the second started at 9.47pm. Ms Brown was taken to Mt Druitt Police Station at about 11.30pm. The ERISP with the appellant was concluded at 12.26am and Ms Brown’s statement was witnessed at 12.50am. 
    27    When the appellant was arrested he was taken to Penrith Police Station. 
    28    It was shortly after 7pm when Detective Senior Constable Banfield, accompanied by Detective Senior Constable Devaney, spoke to the appellant in an interview room. The appellant was cautioned and, when asked whether he was prepared to be interviewed, said that he did not want to say anything. He also indicated that he did not wish to speak about other armed robberies which Detective Banfield had on a list.  
    29    Detective Banfield then told the appellant that a listening device had been fitted to Bannerman and to his vehicle and that conversations involving the appellant had been recorded earlier that day. The appellant was also told that Bannerman had supplied the police with a detailed statement. 
    30    Detective Banfield then said: 
     
      
       
       As we speak, arrangements are being made for a warrant to be executed at your home address in Habersham, searching for clothing, weapons and other items related to these offences. 
       
      
      
    31    The appellant replied: “Oh fuck, Leslie’s going to kill me”. He said that his girlfriend Leslie and another girl called Raelene were at the home. Detective Banfield then said: “It is my belief that these people may have been involved or connected with the offences mentioned on this list and they will be spoken to by the police”. The appellant made no comment. He crouched over, with his hands covering his face. Detective Banfield then said: “At this point, although you have not requested it, you are not permitted to make a phone call or contact anyone, due to evidence at your home possibly being removed or tampered with. Do you understand that?” The appellant made no comment. He appeared to be crying in his hands and remained crying for several minutes. 
    32    Detective Banfield then asked the appellant whether it was still his desire not to partake in any interview. The appellant asked what was going to happen to Leslie and Raelene and was told that they would be spoken to by police as to their involvement in the crimes. The appellant said that they had nothing to do with it. Detective Banfield said that he had been told that Leslie may be wearing stolen jewellery, the proceeds from previous robberies. The appellant replied that she didn’t really know where it came from: “I gave her some bits and pieces. It’s all in hock now anyway”. There was some further discussion about what would happen during the anticipated search at the home. 
    33    The two ERISPs which commenced at 8.12pm and 9.47pm respectively at Penrith then took place. 
    34    I have recounted the events leading up to the Penrith ERISPs as recorded in the note book and evidence of Detective Banfield. His evidence was accepted. Indeed there was little dispute about the portion that I have already set out, although (as I shall indicate) the appellant sought to add to it in certain respects. 
    35    There was a live issue in the voir dire about the timing of a telephone conversation between the appellant and Leslie Brown. The appellant’s evidence that this occurred during the first ERISP was contradicted by that of Detective Banfield and, effectively, by Ms Brown herself. More importantly, it simply could not fit with the objective circumstances which point overwhelmingly to the police ensuring that the appellant had no communication with his wife before the execution of the search warrant and the completion of the interviewing of each of them. The rejection of the appellant’s case on the timing issue obviously contributed, and properly so, to the rejection of his case that the confessions in the two Penrith ERISPs were induced by a deal that the police would not charge Ms Brown if the appellant agreed to cooperate that night. 
    36    It is however necessary to return to the appellant’s evidence on the voir dire to the extent that it casts light upon the remaining issues concerning the admissibility of the three ERISPs. 
    37    The appellant’s evidence was that he broke down and agreed to the interviews after the police told him about Bannerman’s cooperation. (There is no dispute about this.) But he also said that Detective Banfield told him: 
     
      
       
       …that they had my wife, and the girl that was staying with us and her baby at Mt Druitt Police Station, and that they were talking to her and questioning her. 
       
      
      
      
     He said that this caused him to break down and start crying and that, because he wanted to get Leslie out of trouble he agreed to speak with the police (Tr p22). He recounted a conversation with a detective to the effect that the detective would get Leslie to ring him and say she was not going to be charged and the appellant would say or do whatever the police wanted him to do (Tr pp23-4). 
      
    38    In critical passages in his evidence (see Tr pp 23, 26-28, 51), he stated in the clearest of terms that his reason for changing his mind and making the ERISP admissions at Penrith was his concern about his wife and his confidence that “they were going to look after her because I was doing the right thing” (p27). For example, he said (at Tr p51): 
     
      
       
       …The reason I made the admissions I did was on the proviso that the bloke in charge of the operation was going to take Leslie home and let her ring me up. 
       
      
      
      
     At these portions of his evidence he made no reference to any influencing factor other than what he said had passed between him and the police about his wife. See also pp31, 32-33.  
      
    39    It was put to the appellant in cross-examination that the telephone conversation with his wife took place much later in the evening, indeed after the second ERISP had been completed. He said that he could not be sure about this but he doubted that it was that late (Tr p29). The appellant’s evidence about the timing was correctly rejected. It was clear from Ms Brown’s evidence that the search warrant was executed during the mid-evening (she estimated it at about 9.00pm) and that she was then taken to Mr Druitt Police Station where she was interviewed and signed a statement. Her own ERISP finished at 12.27am on 28 June. Obviously she was not allowed to go home until this had happened. She then was allowed to return home and it was from home that she telephoned and spoke to the appellant (see Tr pp66,67, 78, 84. See also Detective Sergeant Dowding’s evidence at pp 91, 92, 106, 109). 
    40    In these circumstances, it is hardly surprising that his Honour rejected the appellant’s evidence that he agreed to make the ERISP admissions because of some inducement based on a deal involving the manner the police would treat Ms Brown and the other girl living at the appellant’s home. The police officers denied any such deal and their evidence was accepted in preference to the appellant’s.  
    41    There is no longer any challenge based upon some deal involving Ms Brown, which was (as I have indicated) the reason advanced by the appellant in his evidence for having made the damning confessions. 
    42    It is clear that the basis of the application to exclude the ERISP evidence was the so-called deal that Ms Brown would not be charged. That is the basis stated at the beginning of the learned judge’s reasons, in the passage set out at par 20 above. 
     
      
     Holding the appellant incommunicado 
      
    43    What is now complained of is the trial judge’s failure to make findings based upon a conversation which the appellant says he took to amount to a refusal to permit him to have access to a lawyer. I shall refer to this as the incommunicado conversation, without preempting the issue of its precise content or purpose. 
    44    Early in his voir dire evidence, as the appellant was giving a version of the discussion with the senior police officer that led to the alleged “deal”, the appellant gave the following evidence (Tr p23): 
     
      
       
       A. Before all this took place there was something I left out. They said, like, “We are not going to let”, the two detectives that originally started questioning me, they wouldn’t let me ring a solicitor because they wanted to carry out a search warrant at 8.30am that night, that’s the house at Habersham, so I couldn’t ring a solicitor but. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Did you ask permission to ring a lawyer? 
       
      
      
       
       A. I didn’t ask because they told me before I asked, they said, “We are not allowing you, we are refusing you to ring a solicitor because he might tamper with evidence that’s at the house that we want to conduct a search warrant at”, so I didn’t ask. They refused it straight away. As things went, unfolded, this detective, I said “You get Lesley to ring me, and let me know that she’s all right and she is not going to be charged with anything from the house, from home, and I will say whatever you want me to say. I will do whatever you want me to do”. 
       
      
      
    45    This evidence was not the subject of cross-examination. However, as indicated above, the appellant’s later evidence in chief and in cross-examination was clearly to the effect that the reason why he commenced the ERISP and continued with it was concern about his wife and his confidence that the police would honour a deal they struck with him before the ERISP commenced. 
    46    Later, in cross-examination, it was put to the appellant that he was told (Tr p49):  
     
      
       
       At this time point, although you have not requested it, you are not permitted to make a phone call or contact anyone, due to evidence at your home, possibly being removed or tampered with.  
       
      
      
      The appellant’s answer was: 
      
       
       I was refused to ring a solicitor only not anybody else.  
       
      
      
     When asked whether he was told that he couldn’t speak to anybody he said: 
      
       
       No, I was told I couldn’t ring a solicitor.  
       
      
      
    47    Detective Senior Constable Banfield was the officer in charge in relation to the proceedings against the appellant. Statements relating to his dealings with Bannerman leading up to and including the arrest of the appellant on 28 May 1997 were read onto the transcript in the voir dire. These included evidence of the conversation with the appellant in which he was told that Bannerman would be giving evidence against him and that evidence had been obtained through the use of listening devices. Detective Banfield also told the appellant that he believed the people at the appellant’s home, including his wife, may have been involved or connected with the offences mentioned on a list (relating to the robberies under investigation). At that stage the appellant made no comment but leant over with his hands covering his face. Detective Banfield then said: 
     
      
       
       At this point, although you have not requested it, you are not permitted to make a phone call or contact anyone, due to evidence at your home possibly being removed or tampered with. Do you understand that? 
       
      
      
     The appellant made no comment and he appeared to be crying. He did not at that stage ask to speak to a solicitor (Tr p118). Then followed the first ERISP which, according to Detective Banfield, was not interrupted by any telephone calls involving the appellant. 
      
    48    Detective Banfield’s evidence about the terms in which he told the appellant that he was not permitted to contact anyone is consistent with what he recorded in his police notebook. Furthermore, his evidence that a reason was given (ie concern about interfering with the integrity of the search at the home) is corroborated by the appellant’s own evidence about the conversation (see pars 43, 45 above). 
    49    Much of Detective Banfield’s cross-examination by Mr Miles related to his dealings with the informant Bannerman and the attempt to make some case for a stay based upon entrapment. 
    50    Detective Banfield agreed that the ERISP in which the admissions were made came after he had told the appellant about the strength of the police case relating to the events of 28 May, after he had told him that he was not allowed to make a phone call (Tr p144) and after he became aware that the appellant was concerned about his wife and the other woman living at his home (Tr pp144, 149). He agreed that he had told the appellant that he was “not allowed to contact anyone” (Tr p151) and that this meant that he was incommunicado, locked off from the rest of the world. He volunteered that this was in relation to property being tampered with or removed from the appellant’s house (Tr p151) and endeavoured to explain he did not mean to exclude a solicitor and that if the appellant had wanted a solicitor he would have got one (Tr pp151-2. See also at p144). 
    51    The submissions are recorded (Tr p195ff). The Crown Prosecutor accepted that the onus in relation to whether or not the accused was induced to make a statement lay on the Crown (he referred to Evidence Act s84). He stated that, as he understood the defence submission it would be that the accused made the admissions he made because it was put to him that if he did not make admissions, then his wife would be charged (Tr p195). The Prosecutor accepted that the onus of establishing illegality lay upon the defence and that, if illegality were established, then the onus shifted back to the prosecution to persuade the court in the exercise of its discretion to allow the evidence to be admitted. It was submitted that the accused also bore the onus in relation to discretions under ss135 and 138 (Tr p196). 
    52    At this stage Mr Miles put his submissions. As to the ERISP evidence, he referred to the appellant’s initial indication that he did not want to say anything to the police. He submitted (Tr p199) that the police then:  
     
      
       
       proceeded to, on their own evidence, to break his will, to make his conversations that followed less than voluntary. 
       
      
      
       
       They put the pressure on him about Leslie being in captivity and they put the pressure on him in respect of other matters which finally came to the point where the evidence is given by them that he broke down and wept.  
       
      
      
     Later (at Tr p200) he referred to the pressure “ 
     put on him by Lesley(sic) and by the entrapment that had occurred with his colleague in crime”. 
      
    53    Nowhere in his submissions did Mr Miles refer specifically to the conversation about refusing the appellant the right to make a phone call prior to the commencement of the ERISP. Nowhere did he deny the statement of the issue on the question of inducement as recorded at the commencement of the Crown Prosecutor’s submissions (par 50, above). When the Crown Prosecutor commenced his main submissions he stated the issue on inducement in similar terms (Tr p204), again without contradiction by Mr Miles. 
    54    As indicated above, there was really no dispute as between the evidence of the appellant and of Detective Banfield that the police officer told the appellant that he would not be permitted to ring anyone lest the integrity of the search at his home that was yet to take place would be compromised. The nature of the conversation clearly locates it within the 7pm-8.30pm time frame. Whatever may have been Detective Banfield’s intentions, the appellant said that he understood the conversation as forbidding the appellant to ring anyone, even a solicitor. The trial judge recorded this part of the appellant’s evidence (Judgment p5). Later (p9) he implicitly found that Detective Banfield had refused to allow the accused to contact anyone by phone. In this context he recorded Detective Banfield’s qualification as to what he had meant by this.  
    55    No further attention is paid to this aspect of the evidence in the judgment. Rather, the judgment addressed the issue raised in the submissions and considered whether the appellant was induced to confess by some deal involving his wife. Judge Armitage correctly rejected that proposition. 
    56    In this Court, the appellant submits that the primary judge erred in not dealing with the issue presented to him by the evidence that the appellant was told that he could not contact anyone prior to execution of the search warrant. It was common ground that Detective Banfield had said this, whatever he may have intended. The appellant said that he took this to include forbidding him the right to contact a solicitor. No finding was made as to whether the appellant was to be believed that those words were used or in this perception of what he was told. We do know that he did not ask to contact a solicitor before the ERISPs at Penrith or the later ERISP at Maroubra (he was brought there from gaol). Whether his failure to seek legal assistance at Penrith was influenced by his perception of what Banfield told him is not the subject of any finding. This is quite understandable, given the way the issue was fought at trial and the fact that the only reason given by the appellant for making the admissions was the so-called deal involving his wife and the other girl staying with them. 
    57    This appeal is to be determined in accordance with the law as it stood before the introduction of Part 10A of the Crimes Act. 
    58    The appellant submits that the Penrith ERISPs should have been excluded because he was held incommunicado. He relies upon ss84(1) and 85 of the Evidence Act 1995, R v Truong (1996) 86 A Crim R 188 and The Queen v Swaffield (1998) 192 CLR 159. The two cases cited deal with a situation quite removed from the present, namely where a person unwilling to speak to the police was effectively tricked into confessing because he did not realise that a friend he was speaking to was an agent of the police.  
    59    In my view, s84(1) did not require the rejection of the Penrith ERISPs. The incommunicado conversation was not relied upon below as “violent, oppressive, inhuman or degrading conduct” let alone conduct that led to the confessions. Had it been, the trial judge would doubtless have addressed the critical issue as to the appellant’s perception of what Banfield was really saying and really intimating and its causative impact. It is far from clear that the appellant would have been accepted on these issues: his credibility was severely shaken by the doomed attempt to set up a case based upon a deal concerning Ms Brown made early in the evening and while she was (on his case) in custody; the conversation was expressly related to police concern about interfering with the integrity of the search then about to be undertaken; the clearest of warnings given at the start of the ERISPs; and the appellant never suggested that the incommunicado conversation induced him to start and complete the three ERISPs. 
    60    The appellant was under lawful arrest. The police were not in the circumstances precluded from asking him whether he would agree to be interviewed despite earlier unwillingness (see Clarke (1997) 97 A Crim R 414). This was not a situation where the will of an accused in custody was broken down by improper pressure or unfair conduct. The revelation that Bannerman had cooperated with the police, that evidence had been collected through the use of listening devices and that the appellant’s wife would be questioned was no doubt the reason why the appellant switched in his resolve and yielded up his right of silence. But I would not characterise the conduct of Detective Banfield in disclosing these matters as “oppressive, inhuman and degrading”. 
    61    Had there been any suggestion at trial that the incommunicado conversation had been the cause of the appellant breaking down I would have been concerned about the absence of findings about precisely what was said, the appellant’s perception of what Banfield said and its causative impact. Non sequitur that I would have found that the trial miscarried. But the critical points are that there was nothing to support the submission that the discussion “influenced” the appellant to confess; and that the case was not run this way at trial. 
    62    The trial judge’s favourable exercise of his discretion is expressed loosely, as if it were a discretion to admit evidence. Having regard to the other findings, it should be read as an exercise of the discretion not to exclude (cf s135). It is pertinent that the judge ruled that the means adopted in the present case to acquire evidence against the accused were legitimate and that there was no public interest to be served in rejecting the admissions made. In the exercise of his discretion he decided that the whole of the challenged evidence would be admitted.  
    63    Had I been of the view that s84(1) applied, or arguably so, then it would have been necessary for this Court to address the different discretion under s138. I would have held that the discretion should have been exercised in the Crown’s favour in light of (a) the non-existent evidence of causal impact of the incommunicado conversation, (b) the failure of the appellant to raise this ground of attack either before or after the ruling which, if erroneous as to the issues, could have been revisited; (c) the absence of evidence that Detective Banfield intended to contravene any law or deliberately to override the appellant’s rights and (d) the absence of any suggestion of doubt about the unreliability of the ERISP confessions. I am satisfied that no miscarriage occurred on this ground. 
    64    Section 85 of the Evidence Act offers even less assistance to the appellant. Not only does the appellant face the problems relating to the “influence” of the incommunicado conversation that I have discussed above, but everything points to the unlikelihood that the truth of the admissions was adversely affected and that is the crux of s85. I have not overlooked the fact that the appellant is an aboriginal person. But little reliance upon this was advanced at trial and none in this Court. The evidence that was tendered on the voir dire apart from the ERISPs shows the appellant to be a determined and resourceful person in his criminal activities (see, eg the listening device transcripts). The true reasons why he agreed to the ERISPs at Penrith have already been referred to. The reliability of the confessions was not disputed in the voir dire or at the trial. 
    65    I would reject Ground 2. 
     
      
     Ground 1: The trial judge erred when he failed to grant the appellant’s application for separate trials 
      
    66    Immediately following the ruling as to the admissibility of the ERISP evidence, the appellant’s solicitor applied that each count in the indictment be heard separately, on the basis that each matter was in fact quite separate. Pressed by his Honour to indicate why the community should be put to the expense of 17 separate trials, Mr Miles submitted that the appellant would have the best possible chance of acquittals if there were individual trials. He expressed concern about the impression that the jury would get from hearing evidence about a group of armed robberies in the same area. He was also concerned because the Crown case depended essentially upon the confessions which were structured in such a way that they dealt with the whole lot of offences together. If separate trials were granted, then only those portions of the ERISP relevant to each trial would go before that particular jury.  
    67    The Crown Prosecutor took objection based on the absence of a timely Notice of Motion (cf District Court Rules Pt 53 r10). He also opposed the applications on their merits having regard to the inextricable overlapping of the various issues and the difficulty that would be involved in extracting the  
     
     events of each individual count from the various ERISPs and listening device conversations. He also reminded the judge of Mr Miles’ submission (made during argument as to the admissibility of the ERISPs) that there was no issue that the admissions were made and that they were reliable. The Crown indicated that it was not proposed to suggest to the jury that similar fact reasoning should be applied.  
      
    68    In reply, Mr Miles submitted that the jury should be allowed to determine the admissibility of the admissions and to determine whether certain types of evidence should be accepted or rejected. 
    69    Judge Armitage gave brief reasons for rejecting the application. He noted that the basis of the application was that the appellant would have a better prospect of a fair trial if the 17 counts were to be separated. His Honour accepted the Crown Prosecutor’s submission that the real issues in the trial were so intrinsically interlinked that it would be extremely difficult to extract the events of each count from the various electronically recorded interviews and the listening device recordings. He also accepted the submission that, in accordance with general principles, no valid basis had been established for the ordering of separate trials. 
    70    The following day Mr Miles renewed his application. He asked the trial judge to make an order “only for one trial, that can be what could be called a test of the whole issue” (Tr p241). The issue foreshadowed was that of police propriety. The discussion that followed shows that what Mr Miles wanted was the opportunity to go to trial on a single count (“Any one the Crown chooses. The worst of the list if they want to.”) on the basis that it would be contested on the issues of police propriety. Mr Miles was concerned that the appellant be in a position to appeal as quickly as possible in the event of an adverse verdict. Reading not far beneath the lines, Mr Miles was wanting to preserve the opportunity for the appellant to plead guilty to the remaining charges, with such benefits as flowed therefrom, if convicted in the “test case”.  
    71    This unusual and inappropriate approach got nowhere. The trial judge refused to have the matter delayed any further and called upon the appellant to plead to the whole indictment. This happened and the trial commenced. 
    72    To the extent that anything appears clearly, the concern expressed by Mr Miles about the joinder of the counts appears to relate to the combination of the robbery counts. Mr Miles was expressing fear that the jury would reason impermissibly having regard to the sheer number of offences charged, the similarities in modus operandi and the broadly common area in which the robberies occurred, regardless of the strength of directions that each charge was to be considered separately. 
    73    Nothing that emerged in the course of the voir dire that intervened between the separate trial application first being made and when it was pressed indicates what, if any, plan was in mind for the conduct of the trial if it was to go ahead. Nothing had been raised about the reliability of the damning ERISPs and nothing to that effect was to emerge in the trial. The closest Mr Miles got to enunciating his client’s “defence” was that based on invitation to the jury to reject the Crown case because of distaste for police methods, particularly the way Bannerman was used to make an overwhelmingly strong case relating to the events of 28 May 1997. And so the trial was conducted. 
    74    The discretion to order the separate trial of counts in an indictment (Crimes Act 1900, s365: see now Criminal Procedure Act, 1986 s64) will not be lightly interfered with on appeal; and the appellate court will examine the impact of the decision upon the trial as it unfolded (R v Guldur (1986) 8 NSWLR 12, R v Verma (1987) 30 A Crim R 441). 
    75    The appellant reminded the Court of the principles stated by Brennan J in Sutton v The Queen  (1984) 152 CLR 528 at 541-2, as approved in De Jesus v The Queen (1986) 61 ALJR 1. 
    76    Given the basis of the present application and the issues involved, the case is far removed from Sutton and De Jesus. In Sutton, the attack on the conviction (ultimately unsuccessful) was based on the prejudice stemming from a joint trial on three counts of rape. Identity was in issue throughout, although two of the victims claimed to identify the accused and, in the case of the third, there was challenged evidence of a confession. 
    77    In De Jesus there were two counts of rape, but the accused was raising an issue of identity in one case and consent in the other. In those circumstances, as Gibbs CJ said (at 3): 
     
      
       
       The jury would inevitably have been influenced by the fact that the offences were tried together to find against the applicant on both issues. 
       
      
      
    78    In my view, Judge Armitage did not err in the exercise of his discretion in light of the grounds advanced at the time, nor did his ruling lead to any miscarriage. 
    79    There was significant evidentiary overlap in that Mr Bannerman was a witness as to the events of 28 May 1997 as well as to some of the robberies dealt with in the later counts of the indictment. It is also relevant that the application to split the counts was pressed at a time after the three ERISPs had been (properly) admitted into evidence and the challenges based upon entrapment or misconduct of the police through Bannerman had been rejected. 
    80    At the time the application was made there was no suggestion that the admissions in the ERISPs were unreliable. No such suggestion was to emerge in the trial. The appellant’s refusal to be cross-examined as to any matters concerning the robbery counts (counts 5-14) really undermines the argument that any miscarriage flowed from the decision rather than providing (as the appellant submits) some material to the contrary. 
    81    The Crown made it plain that it would not be running the trial on the basis that the robberies could be linked through similar fact evidence. The jury were directed not to rely on the robbery evidence as a basis for identification. The details of the robberies were never in issue. The only question was whether the appellant participated in them. If the ERISPs were accepted as reliable then this issue was beyond doubt as to the totality of the robbery counts. 
    82    The jury were given repeated directions to the effect that each count was to be considered separately. Nevertheless, it would have been amazing had they acquitted given the fact that the reliability of the ERISPs was not put in issue at trial and the fact that the jury had seen the appellant refuse to answer any questions by way of cross-examination directed to the later counts in the indictment. 
    83    In De Jesus, Dawson J was one of the majority. He said at (10) that: 
     
      
       
       … the very nature of some offences is such that, as a general rule, they ought not to be tried together if the evidence on one count is not admissible on another count and I think that sexual offences fall into that class. That was the view taken by the Chief Justice in  
       Sutton v The Queen 
        and it is a view which is acted upon in practice. It is a view which derives support from the majority in  
       Reg v Boardman 
        [1975] AC 421. I prefer to express myself in a general way rather than categorically, because it is possible to conceive of instances where the high degree of prejudice which can usually be expected to arise from evidence of offences of a sexual nature does not in fact arise or may be adequately overcome by a proper direction. Where, for example, the sole evidence implicating an accused person in a number of offences of rape is the one confession, it may well be that no unfair prejudice will arise from a joint trial of those offences. Cf  
       Reg v McDonald 
        (1979) 21 SASR 198. 
       
      
      
    84    In McDonald, King CJ and Sangster J said (at 204): 
     
      
       
       Where … the risk of unfair prejudice to the accused from having before them evidence which is admissible on one count but not on another can be removed effectively by an appropriate direction, it ceases to be a consideration in favour of separate trials. There was little risk of prejudice in this case. None of the victims purported to identify the appellant as the assailant. There was therefore no risk of prejudice from an identification in relation to one count being used in considering a count in respect of which it was inadmissible. The truthfulness of the police evidence as to the whole of the confession was in issue. The fact that the police attributed a confession to thirteen crimes to the appellant did not render their evidence any more likely to be believed than if they had attributed a confession to only one crime. There could be no prejudice arising out of the knowledge which the jury had when considering any particular count, of the portions of the confession relation to the other counts. 
       
      
      
      
     Cox J was in substantial agreement with the joint judgment. 
      
    85    The passage quoted from the joint judgment speaks directly to the present case. I would respectfully adopt and apply it. Ground 1 should be rejected. 
    86    I would dismiss the appeal. 
    87    SULLY J: I agree with Mason P. 
    88    SPERLING J: I agree with the orders proposed by Mason P and with his reasons.

       JUDGMENT 
       
       
       
      
    1    HEYDON JA: This is an appeal by Laszlo Szabo against his conviction after a trial by jury before Wood CJ at CL of the murder of his wife.  
     
      
    2    There were two grounds of appeal. One was that the trial judge “failed to adequately and properly direct the jury in relation to the ‘defence’ of ‘provocation’ (s 23 Crimes Act 1900).” The second was that the verdict of guilty of murder “represents a miscarriage of justice”. Not all the contentions propounded in writing in support of these grounds of appeal were pressed in oral argument. 
     
      
       
      Background 
      
    3    The appellant was born in Hungary and was nearly 70 at the time of his wife’s death. By then he had lived in Australia for over 45 years. His wife was 52 and came from the former Czechoslovakia. They had been married for about 8 years. The appellant had two sons from a former marriage and the deceased had two daughters from a former marriage. 
     
      
    4    There was evidence that for some years before the deceased died, there had been friction in the marriage involving arguments about money, verbal abuse and some physical abuse. 
     
      
    5    In May-June 1996 the appellant visited Hungary. On his return he told his first wife that the deceased wanted a divorce. There was evidence that the deceased was having an affair with a particular man; that man gave evidence denying this.  
     
      
    6    At about 7.30am on 16 September 1996 neighbours heard conversation, screaming and loud thumping noises coming from the appellant’s home. The police found the deceased lying in the backyard with extensive head injuries (including two significant skull fractures) caused by repeated blows with a brick. The appellant had suffered minor head injuries. He weighed 68 kilograms and she weighed 56 kilograms. He was taller than her.  
     
      
    7    The appellant told the police he had “killed” his wife. To ambulance officers he said: “I’m okay. I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.” He was described as “upset and depressed”. He told another police officer “I killed her …. I hit her with a brick.” Interviews with the police were electronically recorded.  
     
      
    8    At the trial there was no dispute about the fact that the appellant had killed the deceased. The Crown case was that the appellant had done acts with an “intent to kill”, with an “intent to inflict grievous bodily harm”, or with “reckless indifference to human life”: Crimes Act 1900  
     
      
      s 18(1)(a). The defences were automatism; self-defence; provocation; and diminished responsibility. 
       
      
    9    The appellant called evidence from two psychiatrists. He also called evidence from his former wife, his sons and a friend as to his mental state and relationship with the deceased. The appellant did not himself give evidence.  
     
      
       
      The appellant’s criticisms of the provocation directions in relation to s 23(2) 
       
      
    10    Section 23 of the Crimes Act 1900 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        23. (1) 
         Where, on the trial of a person for murder, it appears that the act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation and, but for this subsection and the provocation, the jury would have found the accused guilty of murder, the jury shall acquit the accused of murder and find the accused guilty of manslaughter. 
         
         
        (2) 
         For the purposes of subsection (1), an act or omission causing death is an act done or omitted under provocation where: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the act or omission is the result of a loss of self-control on the part of the accused that was induced by any conduct of the deceased (including grossly insulting words or gestures) towards or affecting the accused; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon, the deceased, 
        
       
       
        
        whether that conduct of the deceased occurred immediately before the act or omission causing death or at any previous time. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) 
         For the purpose of determining whether an act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation as provided by subsection (2), there is no rule of law that provocation is negatived if: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) there was not a reasonable proportion between the act or omission causing death and the conduct of the deceased that induced the act or omission; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the act or omission causing death was not an act done or omitted suddenly; or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted with any intent to take life or inflict grievous bodily harm. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) 
         Where, on the trial of a person for murder, there is any evidence that the act causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation as provided by subsection (2), the onus is on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act or omission causing death was not an act done or omitted under provocation. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) 
         This section does not exclude or limit any defence to a charge of murder.” 
        
       
      
    11    The appellant made two criticisms of the trial judge’s summing up so far as the requirements of s 23(2) were concerned. His argument was structured around a passage from Masciantonio v R (1995) 183 CLR 58 at 67 which commenced by discussing the common law principles which in Victoria correspond with s 23(2)(a), and in particular the expression “conduct of the deceased … towards or affecting the accused”. Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, the gravity of the conduct said to constitute the provocation must be assessed by reference to relevant characteristics of the accused. Conduct which might not be insulting or hurtful to one person might be extremely so to another because of that person’s age, sex, race, ethnicity, physical features, personal attributes, personal relationships or past history. The provocation must be put into context and it is only by having regard to the attributes or characteristics of the accused that this can be done.” 
        
       
       
      They then turned from the common law principles corresponding to  
       
      s 23(2)(a) to those corresponding to s 23(2)(b) and said: 
       
        
        “But having assessed the gravity of the provocation in this way, it is then necessary to ask the question whether provocation of that degree of gravity could cause an ordinary person to lose self-control and act in a manner which would encompass the accused's actions."" 
        
       
      
    12    The appellant also referred to Green v R (1997) 191 CLR 334 at 339-341 (which quoted Stingel v R (1990) 171 CLR 312 at 326-7), 353-355 and 366-371. The following words of Brennan CJ at 340 received some attention in argument: 
     
      
       
        
        “Paragraph (b) requires the jury to take full account of the sting of the provocation actually experienced by the accused, but eliminates from the jury’s consideration any extra-ordinary response by the accused to the provocation actually experienced. Thus extra-ordinary aggressiveness or extra-ordinary want of self-control on the part of an accused confer no protection against conviction for murder.” 
        
       
      
    13    The first criticism which the appellant made of the summing up related to s 23(2)(a). The appellant submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        “The learned trial judge’s directions in relation to the ‘gravity of the [deceased’s] conduct’ did not impress upon the jury key features of this appellant which were relevant, particularly his ethnicity and the significance of his personal relationships and his past history. …. The way in which his Honour dealt with the appellant’s personal characteristics left the matter in an incomplete and unfair state. It certainly did not draw attention to the significance of the matters raised in the appellant’s interview with the Police as to his relationship with the deceased, and his personal experiences in Hungary. … The appellant was ‘old world’ with significant history of physical abuse in his homeland and he was highly dependent upon the deceased to provide him with future support in his old age. His ethnicity was a significant feature threading through his attitudes and experiences.” 
        
       
      
    14    The second criticism which the appellant made of the summing up related to s 23(2)(b), or, as the appellant sometimes put it, the “relationship” of paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) in s 23(2). The submission was that the trial judge had failed to explain that, in considering whether the provoking conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill, the jury must take into account the accused with all his actual personal characteristics. The appellant said that the jury should have been told also to take into account in relation to s 23(2)(b) the gravity of the provocation which caused the accused to lose self-control. This criticism partly overlapped the first criticism in that, according to the argument, the trial judge should have stressed the appellant’s relationship with the deceased, his personal experiences in Hungary and his ethnicity in relation to how an ordinary person having those characteristics could have behaved in the light of the gravity of the provocation which, ex hypothesi, caused the accused to lose self-control. As the appellant put it: “This was not explained either as to the subjective test [i.e. s 23(2)(a)] or the objective test [i.e. s 23(2)(b)] to be applied.” 
     
      
       
      The summing up on provocation 
      
    15    The trial judge summed up the law to the jury by reference to a document entitled “Summary of Directions”. The part which related to provocation occupied the bottom third of page 3 and the top two-thirds of page 4 and read materially as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Before the accused can be convicted of  
        murder 
        , you must additionally be satisfied by the Crown, beyond reasonable doubt, that the act of his that brought about the death of Helga Szabo was  
        NOT 
         one done under provocation. 
        
       
       
        
        In order to prove that the act of the accused was  
        NOT 
         one done under provocation, the Crown must show beyond reasonable doubt  
        EITHER 
         that: 
        
       
       
        
        [a] Helga Szabo did not engage in conduct or utter words directed towards or affecting the accused, before the act bringing about her death, which were provocative;

        or 
        
       
       
        
        [b] if Helga Szabo did engage in conduct or utter words directed towards or affecting the accused that were provocative, then the accused did not lose his self control because of such conduct or words;

        or 
        
       
       
        
        [c] if the accused did lose his self control because of such conduct or words, then the act of his that brought about the death of Helga Szabo was not one that occurred while he was in loss of his self control; 
        
       
       
        
          
        Proved Not Proved 
        
       
       
        
        or 
        
       
       
        
        [d] if the accused did the act bringing about the death of Helga Szabo while in loss of his self control because of the provocative conduct or words of Helga Szabo, then that conduct, or those words, were not such as  
        could 
         have caused  
        an ordinary person 
         in the position of the accused (ie a person who has the temperament and powers of self control within the limits of what is ordinary for a person of the age and maturity of the accused) to so far lose his self control as to form an intent to kill, or to cause grievous bodily harm to the person responsible for such conduct or words. 
        
       
       
        
          
        Proved Not Proved 
        
       
       
        
         ….”. 
        
       
      
    16    The part of the trial judge’s summing up of which the appellant complains is as follows. He began by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “Provocation in law consists of conduct or words on the part of the deceased directed towards or affecting the accused which caused a loss of self-control, on the part of the accused, which results in the act which brings about death. If, as a result of provocative conduct by the deceased, in this case Helga Szabo, the accused lost his self-control and killed her while lacking that self-control, then he is regarded as having acted in law under provocation and to be guilty of manslaughter rather than murder.” 
        
       
       
      This passage is a summary of s 23(1) and (2)(a). The trial judge then said: 
       
        
        “That is, so long as the conduct of the deceased was such as could have caused or induced an ordinary person in his position to have so far lost his self-control, as to have formed an intent to kill the deceased or inflict really serious bodily harm upon him.” 
        
       
       
      This passage is a summary of s 23(2)(b). The trial judge then said: 
       
        
        “Now, there are a number of elements in that and they 
         
        are all spelt out on page 4 of the summary you have. So let us go to each of those.” 
        
       
       
       Page 4 of the “Summary” contained questions [b]-[d]. The trial judge continued: 
       
        
        “As I have pointed out, the Crown has to prove that the accused was not acting under provocation if it is to make out a case of murder. The Crown may do that in various ways. By disproving one or other of those elements that I just mentioned. We will do that, for example, by proving here that Helga Szabo did not engage in conduct or utter words, that is speak words, directed towards or affecting the accused before the act which brought about her death which were provocative.” 
        
       
       
      He then said: 
       
        
        “Now, I need to explain to you in that regard that although the words or conduct must occur before the act bringing about death, it is not essential, as a matter of law, that they occur immediately before the act causing death. They may have occurred over a period of time. They may be cumulative or act in combination with one or other to cause the accused to lose his self-control. Sometimes there are cases where there are a series of niggling events over a period of time which together build up and eventually cause a person to crack.” 
        
       
       
      This was a reference to s 23(3)(b). He continued: 
       
        
        “However, whatever be the case, you have to ask yourselves: Are you satisfied in relation to this matter that the conduct or words of the deceased were or were not provocative. If the Crown proves that the deceased did not engage in conduct or words directed towards or affecting the accused which were provocative, then it has removed provocation from this case. That is, it has proved that the accused was not acting under provocation. That is the first element.” 
        
       
       
      This was a reference to the first limb of s 23(2)(a). The summing up proceeded: 
       
        
        “The second element is that the conduct must have actually caused the accused to have lost his self-control and to have killed the deceased while in a state where he was deprived of that self-control. As you might expect, if the deceased didn’t in fact lose his self-control, then that would necessarily be the end of provocation, because by definition the accused would not have been acting in a way that he did because of the conduct or words of the deceased. 
        
       
       
        
        As you appreciate, again revenge or punishment for misconduct which are carried out, where a person is still in retention of his or herself control, involve very different considerations. They can’t be said to be acts done under provocation. 
        
       
       
        
        The next requirement, I have actually dealt with both B and C together in that paragraph - I think it is probably easier for you to understand them in that context - but …”. 
        
       
       
      This was a reference to questions [b] and [c] of the “Summary”. It completed his references to s 23(2)(a). Pausing there, the appellant’s complaint was of a want of explanation by the trial judge about the particular characteristics of the deceased relevant to actual loss of self-control. 
       
      
    17    The summing up continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the next requirement of the matter of provocation is an important one, because if the Crown proves that the conduct or words of the deceased are said to have been provocative and to have brought about the loss of self-control which was present when the act was done, which brought about death, were not such as could have caused an ordinary person in a position of the accused to so far lose his self-control as to form an intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm to the person responsible for such conduct or words, then the Crown again has removed provocation from the case. 
        
       
       
        
        Let me go into that in a little more detail. Let me move back a step. When you are asking yourselves the question as to whether the conduct of the deceased in that case actually caused the accused to lose his self-control, then you are dealing with him as you see him in his own natural personality and being. In other words, you look to him as he exists, with his temperament, his approach to life and his age and all his personal features, to see whether in fact he was caused, by those provocative words, to lose his self-control. When you come to this third element, you are looking at a person who, by definition, is an ordinary person. That is, a person who has the temperament and the powers of self-control within the limits of what is ordinary for a person of the age and maturity of the accused. And the question you ask yourselves here is whether the words or conduct of the deceased were such as could have caused an ordinary person, in the position of the accused, that is a person who has the temperament and powers of self-control, within the limits of what is ordinary for a person of the age and maturity of the accused, to so far lose his self-control as to form an intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm to the person who offered those provocative words or conduct. 
        
       
       
        
        You will appreciate that ordinary persons do come in all shapes and sizes. I emphasise we are dealing here, in this third element, with the ordinary person. That is, a person who is not exceptionally or abnormally sensitive to insult, or exceptionally or abnormally fearful. We are concerned with a person who is mentally sound and who has the temperament and powers of self-control within those limits I have mentioned, of an ordinary person of the age and maturity of the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        The question here is whether the conduct was such as could have caused that ordinary person to lose his self-control so as to form that intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. You look, therefore, at the possible reaction of such a person. You do not look at the necessary or even inevitable reaction of that person. You look to see whether the words could have caused that person to lose his self-control, the way I have explained. So again, you are looking at this in the circumstances of the particular case and in the time and setting of any provocative conduct which is identified.” 
        
       
      
    18    Soon after this a short adjournment was taken. The trial judge said that after it he would deal with diminished responsibility. In the absence of the jury, the trial judge then asked whether the directions had caused any problems. No redirection of the type which would have answered the complaints of the appellant on appeal was requested; the Crown Prosecutor asked for examples of what can and cannot be provocation to be given in relation to hearsay provocation and the defence counsel drew attention to a matter not affecting provocation. On resumption, the trial judge gave directions in accordance with these requests and turned to diminished responsibility. Nor was there later any request by the defence for a redirection on provocation, even though the summing up continued well into the following day and even though the trial judge requested counsel to bring any matters which they wished to to his attention at the end of the summing up. The trial judge made it plain to counsel before the summing up began that he was not going to reproduce counsel’s addresses in their entirety. He also said that he was not going to read out “great slabs of transcript” and that if counsel thought the jury should be taken to any passages in full, counsel were invited to draw that to his attention at the end of the summing up. They did not. 
     
      
       
      The summing up on provocation: the s 23(2)(a) criticism 
       
      
    19    In my opinion the first complaint about the summing up is not valid. 
     
      
    20    The trial judge on numerous occasions pointed out that the s 23(2)(a) test called for a loss of self-control on the part of the accused (pages 21.2, 21.4, 22.6, 22.7, 23.2, 23.5-7, 93.7 and 93.9). The “Summary” in three places identified the need for the prosecution to show that the accused had not lost his self-control. Members of the jury must have asked themselves many times how it was that the elderly man accused before them - silent, but constantly visible - had come to kill his wife. They heard much evidence about him.  
     
      
    21    The trial judge frequently referred them to it. The trial judge reminded them of the evidence in a general way at the outset. He said he would not be reading it, but stated his confidence that they had listened carefully to it and could recall most of it. He said that if they wanted any of it re-read he would do so. He then proceeded to offer general advice on a number of matters before stating the law on murder, self-defence, provocation, diminished responsibility and automatism. In relation to each of those topics he did not go to specific evidence: his directions on provocation were no different from his other directions in this respect. He then turned to the evidence in the case, reminding the jury once again that if they wanted any part of the transcript of any witness’s evidence read he would do it.  
     
      
    22    The first detailed exposition of the evidence given by the trial judge concerned the evidence given about the relationship of the appellant and the deceased. He said that that evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “… is available solely, and I emphasise solely, to understand the environment in which the accused and the deceased lived, to appreciate the nature of any differences between them, particularly any which had been building up over the last four months or so, and to assess the significance or importance to each or either of them of any matter which came into dispute over those closing days, and particularly on the Monday which might have been lingering over the preceding days. That may assist you in understanding or reaching a conclusion as to the nature of any argument that morning, the effect upon the accused or the deceased of any matters which had led up to that event, the extent of their love or lack of affection for one another, and the extent to which either or both or neither had for that matter accepted any possible separation. 
        
       
       
        
        Were you not to have that material then you may have been placed in something of a vacuum concerning the feelings of each other by that, the depths to which their marriage had sunk, if it had sunk, the seriousness or otherwise of any differences or quarrels between them, the period over which any quarrels had developed and the circumstances which led up to those quarrels. So I repeat, then, that material is before you for that single purpose of setting the context” (pp. 37-38). 
        
       
      
    23    After an overnight adjournment, the trial judge made various specific points in discussing the relationship evidence. These were that the marriage was in difficulties; that the accused had gone to Hungary from May to July; that there had been arguments, swearing, abuse and some hitting and threats, and that the deceased had suffered bruises. He referred to the evidence of Mrs Cipov, the evidence of the appellant’s former wife, and the evidence of his son to the effect that the accused was “an old-fashioned man with old-fashioned views”, “a person who lived in his own little world and would not adopt a modern life”, and “stoic, quiet, a disciplinarian and perfectionist” (pp. 53-55). Reference was made to the fact that the appellant was speaking in a foreign tongue at the time of the death and in a foreign accent after it. Reference was made to the deceased speaking in a foreign language at that time.  
     
      
    24    The trial judge then discussed the evidence of what happened on 16 September 1996. He discussed the evidence of nine neighbours. He discussed the evidence of the police officers and the doctor who saw the accused straight after the killing. He referred to the records of interview. He referred to various items of physical evidence in relation to the premises, items found on it, and the physical characteristics of the appellant and the deceased’s corpse. He then summarised various things the appellant said to the police which were not recorded. He then referred to some parts of the records of interview, but repeated that he did not propose to read them. He did, however, say - and this his third reference to the playing of the videos in the summing up: “It is very important you play them in full so as to get the full version of the accused as to the historical setting or as to the relationship as to what he said occurred that day.” He then referred to the evidence of other witnesses to whom the accused had spoken and given a version of events. 
     
      
    25    He then read some parts, and summarised other parts, of the histories given to two of the psychiatrists. He referred to evidence about the appellant’s mental state after his departure to Hungary emanating from his first wife and his sons. He then summarised the evidence of the three psychiatrists. The concluding part of his summing up was directed to the addresses of counsel.  
     
      
    26    Before turning to what the trial judge said about the addresses of counsel, it is convenient to interpolate that in evaluating the summing up it is important to remember that the jury viewed the recordings of the appellant’s three police interviews in open court on 20 and 21 July 1998 (the summing up being on 28 and 29 July) and that the jury were asked numerous times to view the recordings after they retired - by Crown counsel in address- (“as many times as you need to”), by defence counsel in address, and several times by the trial judge. The jury was also given transcripts of the recordings. These interviews revealed that he came to Australia in 1950 from Hungary via West Germany; that his wife spoke Slovakian to a friend which he did not understand; that when he went to Hungary on 9 May it was to see his 73 year old brother for the last time; and that when he returned on 28 or 29 July his wife did not pick him up at the airport and was not at home, so that he had to report her as a missing person. He also said that he married her so that “somebody would be able to look after me in my old age. I am a few months away from 70 of my birthday, and while I was overseas she changed, she changed everything. She must, she must had somebody in, in Canberra because constantly she was there” (5/190). He further said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I must put it on the record, you know, that my life had been destroyed in one way, in, in, in my old country back in Hungary. The communist regime, you know, provided eight woman to, to attacking me, you know, and bringing me to court for things. I, I, I had nothing to do with them and in one occasions the Communist detective invited eight woman, you know, and they broke in, into the police department in there, you know, and they started hitting me, you know, eight woman. When I seen that the detective is not assisting me, you know, the woman can kill me, I went back into the corner and whenever somebody comes, you know, I, I fight at them back, and that made, can be that something in my mind, you know, that if I dreaming something in, in my life, you know, that I, I am about getting into fight with somebody, you know, I, I, I’m not waiting anything, you know, in me that I hit first, but my wife had nothing to do with me, you know, hitting me on the head starting a fight” (5/194-195). 
        
       
       
      He said: “I respect, always in my life, you know, I respect the authorities”. He said (5/209): 
       
        
        “You remember I mention it that the Communist womans in my blood, they put me in and they attack me and they … even at the deepest, soundest sleep when, when I dreaming, you know, that somebody I have to face and fight, you know, I hit immediately instead of waiting to be hit”. 
        
       
      
    27    The trial judge stressed the following points as having been made by the Crown in address. It pointed to various circumstances tending to show the improbability of the view that the appellant’s conduct was done by way of self-defence or under provocation. While these matters obviously militated against the appellant’s interests, they naturally called to mind any possible more innocent explanation. After dealing with automatism, murder and self-defence, the trial judge summarised the Crown submission on provocation as follows (pages 93-94): 
     
      
       
        
        “Going on to provocation, the Crown said that it didn’t concede that there was any affair but even if there was one, then that was a matter for the family courts and the like and was not enough to cause the accused to lose his self-control and kill his wife or, indeed, to [cause] a reasonable person in his shoes to so far lose his self-control as to form an intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. In essence, the Crown was saying that the various matters leading up to this day, for marital discord and arguments and so on, were not those which provoked the accused, or if they did provoke him and cause him to lose his temper, then they were not those that could cause a reasonable person, that is, a person of the ordinary temperament and control and so on, with a person of his age and maturity, to so far to lose his self-control as to form an intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm.  
        
       
       
        
        The Crown, of course, suggests that this fight did not begin with the accused striking the deceased with the brick, so that on the Crown case, that aspect of provocation just didn’t exist in this case. Rather, the Crown said, the fight began with the punch to the nose. So on that basis, the Crown says you will be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, this was not an act done under provocation. Rather, that it was an act done in revenge, punishment and so on, but not as a result of a provocative conduct of the kind which would cause the act to be done under provocation at law.” 
        
       
       
      The trial judge then dealt with the Crown’s submissions on diminished responsibility and on the family witnesses.  
       
      
    28    In his summing up the trial judge then turned to summarise the arguments presented by counsel for the accused. He referred repeatedly to the records of interview. After dealing with other aspects, he said the following in relation to the arguments on provocation: 
     
      
       
        
        “If I can pass on to provocation, Mr Young said we are dealing here with a 70 year old Hungarian born man, who is inflexible, with a fear of attacks by women because of his past experience in his homeland, who had married the deceased with the expectation that she would support him, and in circumstances where it appeared that she was not living up to the arrangement in which the marriage had been made and was quarrelling with him over money and over the house. In his words, he said a degree of ingratitude from her part had crept into the relationship. He also said that the accused had been subjected to demeaning language from the deceased and she had not curbed her daughter when the daughter abused him. 
        
       
       
        
        He referred to the threat with the knife, to the fact that the deceased had not picked him up at the airport at the end of July, the indications that his wife was phoning or speaking to someone else and was spending time away from the home and had said it was none of his business when she was asked why she wanted the car. He referred to the shaving cream incident and the diary, where he apparently regarded himself as being treated as a dog, and he referred to the evidence of the accused being struck with a brick. He said these matters together had built up over the months since his return from Hungary, and imposed upon a man who was inflexible, somewhat pedantic, set in his ways, capable of being angered by small things, such as the bathroom, but he usually walked away from disputes, as it occurred on the Sunday morning, built up to a point where he cracked, that is, provoked him to a point where he lost his self-control. He said this was a case where the tensions hadn’t been broken by discussions or confrontation, possibly because of his nature to walk away from arguments of that kind. 
        
       
       
        
        In any event, he said that the events of the day concerning the car and the brick was the straw that broke the camel’s back and in that environment, with a disputation which had built up, you would be left with a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused acted under provocation or not. He reminds you that if the Crown did not prove that he was not acting under provocation, then it had failed to prove that element which is required for the offence of murder (5/104-105).” 
        
       
      
    29    These remarks came very close to the end of the summing up. The summing up concluded with a summary of defence counsel’s submissions on the evidence in relation to diminished responsibility, a summary of his comments on the relationship witnesses, and a summary of his concluding submissions. 
     
      
    30    It is convenient at this point to set out the whole of defence counsel’s submissions which the trial judge was summarising (4/707-710): 
     
      
       
        
        “We ask you to bear in mind, in relation to this, that, firstly, you are dealing with a 70 year old Hungarian born gentleman; that he has been through the life that has been described to us, and in what has been described to us he has been, in essence, inflexible. That he certainly has, as a result of treatment at the hands of women in Hungary when he was a young man, a fear, almost a pathological fear of attacks, particularly at the hands of women. 
        
       
       
        
        He had, as it were, agreed to marry the deceased with a clear expectation, certainly based upon what he told the police, of support. Indeed, he went on to tell the police he was quite prepared, in essence, to deprive his earlier family, his sons, of what might otherwise be their inheritance and to, as it were, leave his estate to the deceased. Part of his, you might think, attempt to live up to his agreement. Part of his agreement was to support her and her daughter and indeed to compensate, as he indicates in his record of interview, those siblings who were left behind in Hungary. It is a indication, I suggest to you, that as his circumstances changed, as he continued to age, inevitably as one must do, as he ceased to work on a full-time basis and went on the pension, it is my suggestion to you that the arguments - and you will be satisfied from what you have been told by the witnesses and particularly the confidants, that there was a degree of ingratitude that crept into that relationship. Really, what was that relationship about? Was that a relationship of love or was that a relationship of expectation of financial support. 
        
       
       
        
        It seems he had to suffer, certainly, demeaning language on a not irregular basis, not only insofar as the deceased was concerned, but apparently her permitting or not attempting to curb the attitude of a young daughter. She is the one who, on the one hand, would tell you, you remember, that he threatened, at some stage, whenever that may have been, nonetheless he threatened to kill them. It must have had an incredible effect on her because it certainly didn't seem to worry her on the morning when she seemed to get stuck into him on the drug dog incident. You would have thought anyone would be inflamed if you were found spoken to in that fashion in your own house; a 70 year old man, when spoken to in that fashion, by nothing more than a child. Threatened, were they? Do you really accept that? If you had been threatened and if you had taken it seriously, you wouldn’t be saying things like that to a man who you believed might be capable of doing you some harm, would you? You think about it. It actually doesn’t ring true, does it? Where is the fear that one would expect to be shown of the accused, if a threat of that nature was made and was ever taken seriously? It is indicative of the fact, I suggest to you, that a threat was never made. Certainly, if any words even remotely like that were said, then they were never taken to have been said with any intent or any purpose. 
        
       
       
        
        There is a prior threat in particular with the knife. Once again, as I have already indicated to you, may be that was a figment of his imagination. But if it was, he must have believed it because he went and hid it. But the real probability is that the threat was made with that kitchen knife and that is why that kitchen knife ended up in the garage. He, of course, also had looming, at that point in time, perhaps it really emanated on his return from Hungary, where it seems that after a period of time changes would seem to have taken place. To turn up at the airport after roughly a ten week sojourn overseas, not to be met by anyone. To be left, as it were standing, in the cold, no doubt wondering what had happened. Even going to the extent, as he says, of putting himself in a position where a blind man, in essence, could see him, standing out like a sore thumb, just in case he hadn’t been recognised from being lost in the crush of the crowd. 
        
       
       
        
        So concerned was this man that he reported his wife as a missing person. You would think that he was setting up something up or do you think he was genuine? You have heard from the young police officer who took the report from him; who described his appearance, that he was obviously concerned and believed something was wrong. Whether at that stage he believed she was dead, she had a car accident, who knows? But sufficiently concerned to actually go and report her as a missing person. 
        
       
       
        
        Of course, his suspicions in relation to his wife’s infidelity, being told in terms of her wanting to take the car, it is absolutely - absolutely being my word, ‘none of your business.’ A man who is not treated with courtesy, who is not being told what is going on, who is being kept in the dark, who is, in effect, as he recorded in the diary, being treated like a dog. It is a lot of thanks, isn’t it, for bringing somebody into this country, taking them under your roof, providing for them and their distant family, to be treated in this fashion. And, of course, we have that incident recorded in the diary. Just another little incident. Another drop in the ocean. 
        
       
       
        
        Then there is this resentment that you can see building, that is held behind his personality, that he is attempting to handle, to cope with in his own way. And the fact that he even gets a can of shaving cream thrown at him, it is a lovely thought, isn’t it? You are in your own house and in just a few years you have gone from being your own master in control to, in essence, being the dogsbody around the house. He, of course, as we know, had his medical condition which was, no doubt, a problem to him. And then, to cap it all off, she wants to take the car to go and see her lover, as he believes that to be the case. If you have got any doubt, if he was wrong about that, she has the temerity, having been told she couldn’t, having been physically stopped, locking the door to make sure she can’t take the car, not setting out to physically restrain her but simply putting a barrier between her and the roadway, that was his act of attempting to stop something that he didn’t believe was right, his thanks for that is he is attacked; his punishment for that, for having the temerity not to let her take the car to see her lover. 
        
       
       
        
        I think, ladies and gentlemen, it would be difficult to find much more provocation than that. This is a build up over the months. Certainly it would seem building up since his return from Hungary. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, he had been stunned, no doubt, you might think, that she wanted to take the car; not telling him why, but knowing deep in his heart why; but then to actually physically assault him, because he wouldn’t let her do it. How much more provocation do you need, as it has been building, being contained, no longer a walk away situation. The problem, it seems, was not the problem any longer that his first wife suffered. Do you remember Margit Szabo telling you one of the problems she had with him was she couldn’t have a real fight with him. I don’t imagine you would think for a moment she was talking about a physical fight. Little doubt you would accept she was talking about a verbal altercation. Bring it out. Have a good full-on blew. Release the tension. That was apparently not his make-up. That was not the way he conducted his affairs. 
        
       
       
        
        So, slowly, I suggest ladies and gentlemen, is this build up over the years, particularly over the last few months, where he didn’t get it out of his system - in this day and age we are told it is in fact healthy to do that; we are told it can relieve the tension. This is a man of a different culture and, in essence, from a different age and not his style. So, surely but slowly it has been building up and building until such time as the final act of provocation, which was the attack upon him, I suggest to you, from then on end has driven him over the edge. It is for the Crown to prove to you beyond reasonable doubt that he did not act under provocation, by the way.”  
        
       
      
    31    The criticism advanced by the appellant proceeded by confining attention to the passages set out in paragraphs [16] and [17] above. Whatever force it has when put in that fashion is diminished when attention is given to the whole summing up, both in what it said expressly and in what it incorporated by reference to the evidence. The trial judge chose to give his directions in relation to the applicable law primarily at one place relatively early in the summing up, while leaving to later stages his directions in relation to matters of fact. Thus it was at a relatively early stage that the trial judge directed the jury in relation to the law on murder, self-defence, provocation, diminished responsibility and automatism. He chose not to relate each of the propositions of law he expounded to the particular facts in detail at that stage. However, by the end of the summing up, the trial judge had reminded the jury of the relevant evidence repeatedly. He did so in a general way at the outset. He also did so in a more particular way when he referred to the relationship evidence, in the course of which he spoke of assessing “the significance or importance to [the appellant] of any matter which came into dispute”, of “understanding … the nature of any argument that morning, the effect upon the accused … of any matters which had led up to that event, the extent of their love or lack of affection for one another, and the extent to which either or both or neither had … accepted any possible separation” and of appreciating the accused’s feelings, the depths to which his marriage had sunk, the seriousness of any quarrels with his wife, the period over which they had developed and the circumstances which led up to those quarrels. He then went into further detail in describing specific particulars of that evidence. Those details would have been fresh in the mind of the jurors because of the contents of the three recorded police interviews which each counsel in address had asked the jury to replay on retiring and which the judge several times referred to and several times suggested they should play on retiring. Finally, those details were narrated again while the trial judge summarised the defence submissions on provocation.  
     
      
    32    It cannot justly be said of the summing up, as the appellant’s submissions would have it, that the directions did not adequately stress the ethnicity of the appellant, the significance of his personal relationships, the significance of his past history (including his personal experiences in Hungary involving physical abuse) and his dependence on the deceased for support in his old age. These matters all received ample attention, either explicitly or by cross-reference. The most that can justly be said is that these matters were not dealt with at the very moment the trial judge was explaining the law on provocation. But in that respect the trial judge was faced with an unavoidable dilemma. He could have referred to the relevant evidence as he expounded each integer of the law of provocation. Alternatively, he could have done what he did: expound the law in one place and make general and specific reference to the evidence in other places. If the former course had been adopted for provocation, as a matter of consistency, it would have been necessary to have adopted it in relation to the separate legal issues of murder, self-defence, diminished responsibility and automatism as well. That would have led to considerable repetitiveness. It would have disturbed the exemplary elegance and clarity which the summing up displayed in relation to the complex legal issues it had to deal with. It would have blown out the length of the summing up, with no necessary gain in intelligibility or fairness.  
     
      
    33    When the trial judge referred, in his account of the law of provocation, to the accused losing “his self-control”, to conduct which “must have actually caused the accused to have lost his self-control”, and to the accused “as you see him in his own natural personality and being … as he exists, with his temperament, his approach to life and his age and all his personal features, …”, the jury was being invited to take into account the totality of the relevant evidence on those subjects. They had heard it; they had been reminded of it in general; they were about to be referred to particular aspects of it both in the trial judge’s summary of it and in the trial judge’s summary of the defence submission about it at the end of the summing up.  
     
      
    34    In my judgment the decision of the trial judge to adopt the course he did adopt did not render the summing up vulnerable to the first criticism to which it was exposed. The trial judge, by reminding the jury of the evidence generally, by explaining the law orally by reference to the “Summary”, by giving more specific directions on the relationship evidence, by summarising the defence submissions on the defences (particularly provocation) and by permitting the jury to consider the facts in the light of the “Summary” left with them, adopted methods which were likely to cause the jury to consider the material facts in the light of the complex defences raised in an intelligible way.  
     
      
       
      The summing up on provocation: s 23(2)(b) criticism 
      
    35    The second complaint about the summing up is also not valid. The trial judge on numerous occasions pointed out that s 23(2)(b) called for them to consider the reaction of an ordinary or reasonable man with the characteristics or in the position of the accused. The question of what the characteristics of the accused were was adequately brought to the attention of the jury by the means discussed in relation to the first criticism put by the appellant, and so far as this second criticism overlaps with the first criticism it must be rejected for the same reasons.  
     
      
    36    This second criticism of the appellant, however, has a further dimension. It became sharply defined in the address on behalf of the appellant in reply. That address focused on the words quoted in paragraph [17] above in relation to s 23(2)(b): 
     
      
       
        
        “And the question you ask yourselves here is whether the words or conduct of the deceased were such as could have caused an ordinary person, in the position of the accused, that is a person who has the temperament and powers of self-control, within the limits of what is ordinary for a person of the age and maturity of the accused, to so far lose his self-control as to form an intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm to the person who offered those provocative words or conduct.” 
        
       
       
      The appellant’s submission in reply concentrated on this sentence because Crown counsel had submitted that the words “in the position of the accused” picked up the particular characteristics of the appellant. Crown counsel said that the “clue is given by the use of” those words. Counsel for the appellant responded: 
       
        
        “As a matter of importance in the conduct of criminal trials juries are to be given and should be given clear and unambiguous directions on matters of law. The jury should not be left to divine clues from particular words used by the judge to understand what the law requires them to do.” 
        
       
       
      Counsel for the appellant submitted that in the sentence quoted above, after “the deceased” the trial judge should have inserted the words “having regard to their gravity as they affect the accused”. He concluded: 
       
        
        “Those words make clear what the jury has to consider arising out of sub-paragraph (a) and his Honour did not do that. 
        
       
       
        
        My friend used the words ‘the clue’ there. Well, with the jury sitting in the jury box and having listened to a lengthy and detailed summing-up, consideration of the proper principles of law to apply should not depend upon divining a clue from three or four words uttered by the judge.” 
        
       
      
    37    It is questionable whether, if what the trial judge did say was inadequate, the jury would have been better off by the addition of the further ten words suggested by the appellant into a sentence which was already, and necessarily, complex. However, the question is whether the proposition conveyed by the suggested words was not in fact conveyed by the trial judge by the words he did use. 
     
      
    38    Again the summing up as a whole must be considered. 
     
      
       
      (a) The trial judge told the jury that the conduct of the deceased had to be “such as could have caused or induced an ordinary person  
      in his position  
      to have so far lost his self-control, as to have formed an intent to kill the deceased or to inflict really serious bodily harm upon him” (bold emphasis added). An element which might have caused an ordinary person in the “position” of the accused to lose self-control is the gravity of the words as they affected the accused, and their effect on the accused can only be assessed in the light of his personal characteristics.  
       
       
      (b) Further, the trial judge told the jury that the Crown had removed provocation from the case if the Crown proved that the allegedly provocative items of conduct “were not such as could have caused an ordinary person  
      in a position of the accused 
      ” to lose self-control in the manner described in s 23(2)(b) (bold emphasis added). The expression “position of the accused” necessarily refers to the gravity of the items of conduct as they affected him, and their effect on the accused can only be assessed in the light of his personal characteristics.  
       
       
      (c) The trial judge told the jury that the question was “whether the words or conduct of the deceased were such as could have caused an ordinary person,  
      in the position of the accused 
      ” to lose self-control in the manner described in s 23(2)(b) (bold emphasis added). Again, the expression “position of the accused” necessarily refers to the gravity of the items of conduct as they affected him, and their effect on the accused can only be assessed in the light of his personal characteristics. 
       
       
      (d) The trial judge also said, in summarising the Crown argument on provocation near the end of his summing up, that if the deceased was having an affair, that “was not enough to cause the accused to lose his self-control and kill his wife, or, indeed to call [cause] a reasonable person  
      in his shoes  
      to … lose his self-control” in the manner described in s 23(2)(b) (bold emphasis added). An examination of a reasonable person in the shoes of the accused would include a consideration of the gravity of the conduct as it affected the accused, and their effect on the accused can only be assessed in the light of his personal characteristics. 
       
       
        
        (i) That passage late in the summing up, uttered in the early afternoon of 29 July 1998, would have caused the jury to call to mind the following passage in the Crown Prosecutor’s address which they heard shortly before the luncheon adjournment on 27 July 1998: 
         
          
          “The Crown doesn’t concede that there was an affair between Mrs Szabo and any person, but even if there was an affair between Mrs Szabo and some other person … , then what was it about that that could have provoked this accused to have so far lost control of his actions through anger, words directed at him or actions directed at him, so as to commit the crime of murder? Because it has got to be the crime of murder first, then reduced by provocation, and the Crown says that there is nothing in the evidence that could possibly cause, firstly, the Crown says, him to have lost his self-control in that way or, secondly, for it to be considered that a reasonable person in the place of the accused could have lost his self-control in that fashion.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       That passage, in relation to the actual accused, links the “words directed at him or actions directed at him” as a cause of loss of “control of his actions through anger” with the issue of whether “a reasonable person  
      in the place of the accused 
       could have lost his self-control in that fashion.” 
       
       
      (ii) Similarly, the trial judge’s reference on 29 July to the Crown argument, would be likely to have brought to the minds of the jury the statements of defence counsel during his argument on 28 July which are quoted at paragraph [30] above. For present purposes some key passages are as follows (emphasis added):  
       
        
         “You would have thought anyone would be inflamed if  
        you  
        
       
       were found spoken to in that fashion in your own house; 
       
        
         a 70 year old man, when spoken to in that fashion, by 
        
       
       nothing more than a child … 
       
       
       A man who is not treated with courtesy, who is not being 
       
       told what is going on, who is being kept in the dark, who is, 
       
       in effect, as he recorded in the diary, being treated like a  
       
       dog. It is a lot of thanks, isn’t it, for bringing somebody into 
       
       this country, taking them under  
      your 
       roof, providing for 
       
        
         them and their distant family, to be treated in this fashion. … 
        
       
       
        
      You 
       are in  
      your 
       own house and in just a few years  
      you 
       
       have gone from being  
      your own 
       master in control to, in  
       
       essence, being the dogsbody around the house. … 
       
       
       I think, ladies and gentlemen, it would be  
      difficult to find 
       
        
      much more provocation 
       than that. …  
       
       
       How  
      much more provocation 
       do  
      you 
       need, as it has been 
       
       building, being contained, no longer a walk away situation.” 
       
       
        
        The invitation, by the repeated use of “you” and “your”, and in other ways, to the jury to put themselves in the accused’s position, involved a suggestion that the gravity of the provocation, in its impact on reasonable persons such as the jurors, had to be assessed by reference to the personal characteristics of the appellant which counsel was describing in considerable detail. Similarly, the contentions that this was either the most extreme case of provocation imaginable or something approaching it, taken with the trial judge’s general directions on s 23(2)(b), would have suggested that the gravity of the provocation would not only have caused a person with the personal characteristics of the appellant to lose self-control, but it would also have caused any person, including any ordinary person, with the personal characteristics of the appellant to lose self-control.  
         
          
        
       
      (e) Finally, and most importantly, the terms of the “Summary” must be remembered. Its terms are important because the trial judge frequently spoke to it and left it with the jury. It is to be presumed that they worked through it and paid careful regard to its language. Question [d] was: 
       
        
         
          
          “if the accused did the act bringing about the death of Helga Szabo while in loss of his self-control because of the provocative conduct or words of Helga Szabo, then that conduct, or those words, were not such as  
          could 
           have caused  
          an ordinary person 
           in  
          the position of the accused 
           … to so far lose his self control [in the manner described in s 23(2)(b)]” (bold emphasis added).  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Again, the expression “position of the accused” refers to the gravity of the items of conduct as they affected him in the light of his personal characteristics.  
        
       
      
    39    The “Summary” also illustrates a point which is true of the references to s 23(2)(b) in the summing up itself, but highlights it more starkly. Question [d] is preceded by questions [a] - [c]: see paragraph [15] above. Question [a] concentrates on the existence of “conduct … or words directed towards or affecting the accused … which were provocative” (bold emphasis added). Question [b] assumes the existence of conduct or words directed towards or affecting the accused which were provocative, and concentrates on whether “the accused did not lose his self control because of such conduct or words” (bold emphasis added). Question [c] assumes that the accused did so lose his self-control, and concentrates on whether “the act of his that brought about the death of Helga Szabo was not one that occurred while he was in loss of his self control” (bold emphasis added). As the jury worked through questions [a] - [c], they must have been concentrating on the particular behaviour of the deceased and its actual impact - its gravity or otherwise - on the accused. When they turned to question [d], having performed those inquiries, they must have read “the position of the accused” as requiring them to bear in mind the gravity of the conduct as it affected the accused in the light of his personal characteristics in assessing what that conduct could have caused an ordinary person in the position of the accused to do. 
     
      
    40    However, there is a competing possibility to be dealt with in relation to question [d] in the “Summary”. That possibility is that the expression in question [d] “in the position of the accused” is explained by the words which follow in parenthesis, being words which do not import any consideration of an assessment of the gravity of the provocation by reference to its significance to the appellant. If this competing possibility is a sound reading, the words in parenthesis “(i.e. a person who has the temperament and powers of self control within the limits of what is ordinary for a person of the age and maturity of the accused)” would not qualify the words “an ordinary person”, but would qualify the words “the accused”. If this were a sound reading, then the “Summary” would not have assisted the jury to grasp the s 23(2)(b) element of provocation and indeed might mislead them into concentrating mainly or solely on the ordinary person without considering the gravity of the provocation by reference to the appellant’s personal characteristics. This point was not advanced in these terms by the appellant on the appeal, but it must be dealt with. In my judgment the suggested reading is not a sound reading. The words in parenthesis include a reference to “what is ordinary” for a person of the accused’s age and maturity: that is a reference back to the ordinary person, not to specific features of the accused. The specific features of the accused, and the assessment of the gravity of the provocation on the ordinary person by reference to the accused’s personal characteristics, were brought into play by the reference to the position of the accused.  
     
      
    41    There are three further matters relevant to an assessment of the appellant’s second criticism. The first is that defence counsel who appeared at the trial was of very considerable experience in criminal cases. As already noted, despite opportunities to do so, he did not seek any redirection on provocation which would meet the criticism now made, though the Crown did seek a redirection on a different aspect of provocation. Though this circumstance in itself could not constitute a preclusion of the appellant from making any otherwise valid criticism of the summing up in relation to provocation, it does support the view that at the trial there was not felt to be any problem with the summing up in this respect and that in truth there was no such problem.  
     
      
    42    The second matter to be borne in mind arises out the way in which the appellant’s arguments were presented. The original written submissions of counsel for the appellant approached the identification of the supposed defect by reference to the passage from Masciantonio v R set out in paragraph [11] above. In further written submissions, the matter was approached by reference to Masciantonio v R, Stingel v R and Green v R. In oral argument, the matter was approached by reading quite lengthy passages from Masciantonio v R and Green v R, including passages quoted in the latter case from Stingel v R, before the argument turned to analysis of the second criticism. The fact that the contention that there was a radical deficiency in the summing up called for such elaborate approach work raises a real question of whether there was in truth any such deficiency. If a “deficiency” takes a long time to expose and can only be exposed by reading numerous partially conflicting judgments in three different High Court cases, the force of the suggestion that it is a deficiency is weakened. The form in which appellate courts state their reasoning in analysing rules of law - here rules of law found in quite brief statutory provisions - is not necessarily appropriate for adoption and incorporation in jury directions. The trial judge’s directions to the jury followed the statutory language and, taken as a whole, those directions explained it accurately. No vice in them can be found in not incorporating the juristic analysis of other judges expounded to a different audience for a different purpose. Nor can any fair criticism be based on the fact that particular passages taken in isolation did not state the totality of the statutory meaning, when all the material passages read as a whole did.  
     
      
    43    The third matter concerns the question of what exactly the trial judge should have done. Defence counsel at the trial having made no suggestion that the trial judge should do anything different from what he did do, counsel for the appellant on the appeal propounded only general criticisms in the written submissions and the oral argument in chief. In the oral argument in reply an explicit suggestion was made that the trial judge should have added the words “Having regard to their gravity as they affect the accused”: see paragraph [36] above. The smallness of this change raises doubt about whether it was really necessary. Is a lengthy summing up in a difficult case which is in every other respect impeccable fairly open to criticism by reason of so small an omission? Once the first criticism in relation to provocation, and so much of the second criticism as overlaps with it, are accepted as failing, it must be accepted that there was sufficient explanation of the need for the jury to assess the gravity of the provocation by reference to the personal characteristics of the accused. The second criticism then reduces itself to a complaint of a somewhat formal and artificial character. If the second criticism could have been overcome so simply and briefly, analysis of the validity of that criticism must focus on whether the problem was not in truth overcome in some other way in the quite substantial passages devoted to provocation. In my judgment it was, because on almost every occasion when the objective test in s 23(2)(b) was mentioned, the jury were told to consider the reaction of an ordinary person in the position of the accused, and the central inquiry about the position of the accused would inevitably have turned on the gravity of the allegedly provoking conduct of the deceased as it affected the accused in the light of his personal characteristics.  
     
      
    44    The appellant also submitted as part of the second criticism that the trial judge erred in expressing the tests stated in s 23(2)(a) and (b) as two tests without explaining the relationship between them. So far as he did divide up the issues for consideration, he proceeded in a manner likely to be of positive assistance to the jury. But in doing that he did not use language capable of causing them to fail to appreciate the relationship between the two paragraphs. 
     
      
    45    There is no doubt that the intellectual process which s 23(2)(b) calls for is a complex one. In my opinion the trial judge explained that process adequately to the jury, and the second criticism propounded of the summing up fails.  
     
      
       
      The appellant’s criticisms of the provocation directions in relation to s 23(3)(a) and (c) 
       
      
    46    The appellant’s submission was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “… his Honour failed to direct the jury that the provocation claimed was not negatived by the fact that the act was not ‘reasonably proportional to the conduct of the deceased that could induce the acts’ causing the death of the deceased. Nor did his Honour direct the jury that the acts of the appellant if done with an intention to kill or an intent to inflict grievous bodily harm did not negative provocation (s 23(3)(a)(c)  
        Crimes Act 
        ). These were important directions in this matter particularly having regard to the character of the attack upon the deceased and the nature of the provocation claimed by the appellant. The directions left the issue of ‘proportionality’ unaddressed in circumstances where it clearly would be of concern to a jury. In fact the issue, if anything may have been interpreted by the jury as requiring ‘proportionality’ to be considered in determining whether relevant conduct could induce ‘an ordinary person’ to relevantly lose self control.” 
        
       
      
    47    The directions which the appellant contends should have been given were not requested by his counsel at the trial.  
     
      
    48    The duty of the trial judge was to direct the jury on the applicable principles of law. Unless the circumstances of the case made it necessary, he had no duty to direct them about what was not the law. The Crown did not suggest, contrary to s 23(3)(a), that provocation was negatived by any lack of reasonable proportionality between the accused’s conduct and the deceased’s conduct. The trial judge repeatedly directed the jury that the s 23(2)(b) issue was whether the ordinary person would have lost self-control in the manner described in that paragraph; if so, it would not matter how much greater the accused’s reaction might have been compared to that of the ordinary person, and the trial judge did not suggest that it would matter. 
     
      
    49    The Crown did not make any submission to the contrary of s 23(3)(c). Hence the s 23(3)(c) direction, to which no oral argument was directed, was not called for. 
     
      
       
      Miscarriage of justice: was it open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown had excluded provocation? 
       
      
    50    The appellant submitted that on examination of the whole of the evidence, it was not reasonably open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant on the charge of murder: M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493-494; Jones v R (1997) 191 CLR 440 at 450-453. This submission, so far as provocation is concerned, calls for consideration of whether it was reasonably open to reject the contentions of the appellant in that regard. It was submitted that the Court of Criminal Appeal should entertain a doubt as to whether the prosecution had adequately established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had not acted under provocation. The following aspects of the evidence were pointed to. The appellant at the time of the killing was nearly 70 years of age and of frail health. He was of Hungarian origin with “old world views”. He had been married to the deceased for eight years, he was dependent upon her, and he had an expectation, given the circumstances of the marriage, that she would care for him in his old age. He had been the subject of threats and insults. He believed on reasonable grounds that she had been involved in an affair with another person behind his back. He had been let down or neglected by the deceased over a period of time immediately before the killing. The deceased had indicated a desire to sell the family home and possibly divorce the appellant contrary to his wishes. The deceased promoted verbal disputes with the appellant on the day before her death, causing the appellant to leave home, and had also promoted verbal disputes with the appellant on the day of her death. There was evidence that the appellant believed that the deceased had wished to travel out of Sydney on the day of her death to continue her affair. The deceased had struck a blow or blows to the head of the appellant. It was submitted that the Crown evidence from members of the deceased’s family suggesting that the appellant had been violent towards her was weak and contradicted by less biased sources. It was submitted that at its highest that evidence was concerned with remote incidents of a relatively minor nature, particularly having regard to the circumstances of the fatal assault upon the deceased. Persons who knew both the appellant and the deceased gave evidence to contradict the view that the appellant was argumentative with the deceased or was disposed to resort to force against her. It was submitted that the evidence strongly supported the view that the appellant lost control by reason of the specific events of the day, which, in the context of the background evidence and the appellant’s characteristics, pointed to provocation. Anger, translated into extreme violence, was entirely uncharacteristic of the appellant. Hence provocation could not be excluded beyond reasonable doubt, and the jury’s conclusion to the contrary was perverse and unreasonable. It was also submitted that use of a brick as weapon showed that the killing was without premeditation or planning. These arguments were similar to some of those summarised by the trial judge in the passage quoted at paragraph [28] above.  
     
      
    51    At the trial the appellant contended that the deceased had been the aggressor in the acts of violence which occurred and led to the death of the deceased. There was material before the jury in which the appellant asserted that the deceased began the violence by hitting him on the head with a brick while he was still in bed, and thereafter persistently attacked him by the use of violence including kicking (three times in the groin), punching and biting. The appellant, in his records of interview and statements to psychiatrists, pictured himself as being largely on the defensive to the point where he believed that he was going to have the worse of the fight.  
     
      
    52    One difficulty in these contentions is that they were contradicted by other material emanating from the appellant to suggest, not that he had been lying on the bed when he was first attacked, but that he had been making it. Another difficulty was that he was taller and heavier than the deceased. A further difficulty was the disparity between the deceased’s very severe injuries and the appellant’s relatively superficial injuries, which suggested improbability in the appellant’s claim of being on the receiving end of aggression from the deceased. There were aspects of the appellant’s story which he repeated to some witnesses but not to Dr Anderson, who said that the accused had not mentioned being hit on the head with a brick or being kicked in the groin. The evidence of the neighbours Tracey Moore, Angela Griffith and Kathleen Ann Henley of female screaming and moaning suggested that the deceased was fearful and on the defensive, not the appellant. Some of what the appellant said in his records of interview pointed to the conclusion that just before the deceased was struck with the final blow from the brick, she was helpless, promising to stay with him and in effect pleading for her life. That could support a conclusion that any provocative conduct had ceased to influence the appellant.  
     
      
    53    These factors point to the conclusion that it was well open to the jury to reject the appellant’s account of what happened in the period leading up to the death, and thus to reject his account of having been provoked by a physical attack. So far as material emanating from the deceased supported the argument based on provocation by the deceased’s conduct apart from any physical attack, it was in consequence open to the jury not to believe it. Thus the jury were entitled to conclude that there was no provocation, or that it did not cause the accused to lose his self-control, or that his attacks on the deceased which caused her death did not occur while he had lost self-control. The appellant’s submission was that it was not open to the jury to conclude that provocation was negatived, because there was no explanation for the appellant’s conduct except provocation. In my opinion it was open to them to have done so.  
     
      
       
      Miscarriage of justice: was it open to the jury to convict in relation to diminished responsibility? 
        
       
      
    54    The appellant submitted that on examination of the whole of the evidence at the trial it was not reasonably open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant because having regard to the evidence as to the background and presentation of the appellant at the time of the deceased’s death and the medical evidence as to his mental state, he had, on the balance of probabilities, established that he was suffering from an abnormality of mind that substantially impaired his mental responsibility for the acts causing the death of the deceased: Crimes Act 1900, s 23A. The precise issue raised by this argument was whether it was open to the jury to decline to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that diminished responsibility had been established.  
     
      
    55    The appellant submitted that on the evidence of the appellant’s conduct prior to the killing, his conduct during the investigation, and observations made of him immediately afterwards, taken with the medical evidence advanced in his case, supported the conclusion that his conduct had been induced by an abnormality of mind which had substantially impaired his mental responsibility. It was submitted in relation to the contrary view of Dr Skinner that nothing in her examination revealed any understanding or information about the appellant from persons who had some knowledge of his background and his manner and presentation prior to the killing of the deceased. It was submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        “Importantly, … significant matters in the evidence of the Crown’s witnesses (such as delusional beliefs and ‘telescoping’ of events) that reflected either evidence of memory loss or thought disorder were either not available to Dr Skinner as history or alternatively, were ignored or down played by her in the assessment of the mental state of the appellant.” 
        
       
       
      It was submitted that the appellant had acted so uncharacteristically that his conduct must have been induced by a state of mind which substantially reduced his mental responsibility. Finally, it was submitted that this was supported by his distress and expressions of contrition, rather than anger or self-justification, within minutes of the killing, and that there was no evidence of premeditation or planning.  
       
      
    56    The medical evidence advanced in the appellant’s case was that of Dr Jurek and Dr Robertson. Dr Jurek was of the view that the appellant had dementia to a degree that was beyond the normal ageing process. She thought that because of the appellant’s cardiovascular problems, cerebral perfusion would have been induced by the stress of the struggle between the appellant and the deceased. She considered that, under the stress of the struggle, the appellant would have gone into a disassociated state, in which he would not have known what he was doing, but would have just kept lashing out. She considered that the appellant had been in a state of automatism. She did agree that brain scans of the appellant had not indicated the presence of dementia or any serious head injury. 
     
      
    57    While Dr Robertson thought the appellant had brain damage and thought disorder in the form of perseverating and considered that the appellant would have become hypoxic during the struggle, which would have very significantly impaired his judgment and his ability to control his behaviour, he did not think the appellant had dementia and he rejected the possibility of automatism.  
     
      
    58    Dr Skinner said that the appellant showed no abnormality of mind. She found no evidence of dementia or thought disorder. She said psychological testing had shown no significant abnormality of brain function and no evidence of brain damage. In relation to the suggestion by Dr Jurek and Dr Robertson of hypoxia, Dr Skinner said that persons affected by hypoxia usually act in a purposeless and confused way with an unawareness of their surroundings. She regarded the appellant’s statements to police and actions in the company of the police while being interviewed walking around the house as inconsistent with hypoxia. She disagreed with Dr Robertson’s view that the accused had been suffering thought disorder in the form of perseverating. She said the appellant showed no mental impairment or mental illness.  
     
      
    59    It was open to the jury to conclude that the appellant had failed to discharge the burden of proof which lay on him of establishing diminished responsibility. His two witnesses to a significant extent contradicted each other on the questions of automatism and dementia. So far as their opinions depended on what the appellant had told them, they were liable to be affected by adverse views open to the jury about the credibility of the appellant’s hearsay statements. To the extent that Dr Skinner rested her opinions not on what the appellant told her but rather on her own observations and on objective testing, it was open to the jury to treat her opinions as more soundly based. The criticisms of Dr Skinner which the appellant made on the appeal were not put to Dr Skinner in cross-examination in such a way as to cause her to modify her opinions. 
     
      
       
      Miscarriage of justice: irregularities in the conduct of the trial 
      
    60    It was submitted by the appellant that there were irregularities in the conduct of the trial which caused a miscarriage of justice: M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-493; Gipp v R (1998) 194 CLR 106 at 114.  
     
      
    61    This submission raises an inquiry into whether there was some defect in the summing up or some feature of the case raising a substantial possibility that, either in the conclusion which the jury reached or in the manner in which it was reached, the jury might have been mistaken or misled.  
     
      
    62    The first contention was that the trial judge’s directions on provocation, even if not technically misdirections, were incomplete and misleading. This submission did not point to any submission beyond those advanced in relation to the first ground of appeal, which have been rejected. They must also be rejected in relation to the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
    63    Secondly, the trial judge was criticised for failing to direct the jury in relation to the appellant’s good character. The trial judge asked the appellant’s counsel whether he wanted a good character direction. Counsel, after referring to a shoplifting charge in relation to which the appellant received the benefit of s 556A of the Crimes Act 1900, indicated that he had decided not to ask for a character direction and that he did not do so. The trial judge said to the Crown: “If there is evidence there of good character then I have got to give the direction, but at the moment I don’t see it”. The Crown did not suggest there was evidence of good character and did not ask for a character direction.  
     
      
    64    The appellant submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        “In reality there was a body of evidence in the trial of good character. There was evidence of his generosity to his fellow countrymen, his relationship with his children, his generosity to the deceased and her family, his non violent temperament (on one view of the evidence), his unwillingness to be involved in arguments, his industry and hard work throughout his life, his affection for the deceased and his remorse for the killing of the deceased amongst other matters. He was described as ‘shy’ and ‘retiring’. 
        
       
       
        
        … In this matter the jury had the benefit of a direction that the evidence of the appellant’s conduct towards the deceased, in a sense evidence of ‘bad character’, although not available to establish that he was likely to have murdered the deceased, was available for the purpose of explaining the relationship between the appellant and the deceased, so as to put the allegations in context (eg: SU18.2). The jury had no directions whatsoever as to the relevance of evidence to the contrary as it may explain the conduct of the appellant in circumstances where the jury was considering the issue of provocation and the defence of diminished responsibility or even self defence. 
        
       
       
        
        … the appellant was entitled to an appropriate direction on character to provide a balance to the Crown’s case.” 
        
       
      
    65    The items of “good character” suggested were not put to the trial judge apart from the appellant having assisted members of his community. Contrary to what the trial judge suggested, it is not obligatory on a trial judge to give a character direction in every case: Simic v R (1980) 144 CLR 319 at 333-4; Melbourne v R (1999) 164 ALR 465 at 471-478, 484 and 505-506. If a character direction is requested, it is generally wise to give it; but here it was not requested. The appellant submitted that it was appropriate to give it because of the relationship evidence. However, the trial judge did explain the limited use to which the relationship evidence could be put and told the jury that they were not to “infer or reason from that evidence that [the appellant] was a person who was likely to have killed [the deceased]”. Since the appellant did not testify, evidence of good character was irrelevant to the credibility of sworn testimony. Its relevance to the issue, if any, was to show him to be a person who was not likely to have killed the deceased unless he was acting under provocation, acting in self-defence, acting under the influence of automatism, or acting with diminished responsibility. The direction against using the relationship evidence on that issue meant that the case was not one in which it was appropriate for the trial judge to give a good character direction. The authorities on which the appellant relied, R v BRS (1991) 148 ALR 101 and R v D (1996) 86 A Crim R 41, have no application to the present circumstances.  
     
      
    66    The third criticism which the appellant advanced was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Another aspect of the conduct of the trial which had the potential to mislead the jury was the introduction of ‘reckless indifference’ as a basis for finding the appellant guilty of murder. It should not be left in an inappropriate case ( 
        La Fontaine v The Queen 
         (1976) 136 CLR 62 at 69). His Honour was concerned about whether it was appropriate … The Crown called it ‘the very fall back situation’ … Counsel for the appellant acquiesced quite unnecessarily. The introduction of this ‘head’ of murder raised a particular complication given the terms of s 23(2)(b)  
        Crimes Act 
         in respect of provocation. This was clearly an intent case. The appellant’s violence was directed at the deceased. It is wrong in principle for the Crown to alternatively plead in inappropriate circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    67    The matters of fact relevant to provocation would have been the same even if the question of reckless indifference had not been left to the jury. Hence no additional complication was created in relation to s 23(2)(b), and the trial judge’s decision to leave reckless indifference to the jury did not cause anything to take place which had the potential to mislead the jury in that or any other respect.  
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
       
      
    68    I propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    69    JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of Heydon JA. 
     
      
    70    BELL J: I agree with the reasons of Heydon JA.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
        
       
      
     1     
     MEAGHER JA : I will ask Grove J to give the first judgment. 
      
       
      
     2     
     GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal asserting the inadequacy of sentence imposed by Moore DCJ in the Wollongong District Court. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The respondent appeared before his Honour on two counts of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug. The drug in question was methylamphetamine. 
      
       
      
     4     
     His Honour was also asked to take into account two matters on a Form 1, relating to possessing another prohibited drug, namely cannabis leaf, and a prohibited object, namely a canister of Liquid Fire pepper spray. His Honour sentenced the respondent to forty hours community service to be performed by way of attendance at an attendance centre. 
       
       
      
       
      
     5     
     It cannot be said that such a sentence causes other than surprise at first glance. However, the matter should be analysed in a little more detail. 
      
       
      
     6     
     The respondent played a relatively minor part in the supply of the prohibited drug. That is not to say, as his Honour observed, that the offence was not itself serious, nor is it to overlook the circumstance that the drug trafficking sub-culture is able to exist because many people will contribute what might be described as minor assistance. 
      
       
      
     7     
     The respondent came into contact with these people because it was said that as a result of an injury causing grave physical disability he was self-medicating with prohibited drugs. His Honour found that was a fact and no challenge to that fact finding has been offered. 
      
       
      
     8     
     As a result of his contact with these people engaged in criminal activity the respondent was invited to act as a courier of prohibited drugs. He declined the invitation but he did not decline the invitation to refer to the criminals persons who would be willing to undertake such a role. 
      
       
      
     9     
     In written submissions supplied to the Court by the parties there has been some debate as to the status of the respondent as a recruiter of couriers. The facts proved before his Honour and found by him show that the respondent’s activity as a recruiter was no more than that which I have mentioned, together with driving a couple of the recruits to the premises where the traffickers were to be found. 
      
       
      
     10     
     The respondent was born on 18 February 1944. At the age of thirty nine he was subjected to coronary artery bypass surgery. That was a relatively young age to require such surgical intervention. He has since had further procedures of a surgical nature and evidence was before his Honour, again unchallenged, that it was a rare event for patients to survive initial coronary artery bypass surgery for twenty years. The respondent’s initial surgery took place some sixteen years ago. 
      
       
      
     11     
     The evidence of Dr Ford, who is a consultant physician and cardiologist, also was that the respondent was suffering from continuing ill health as a result of this condition. Indeed, this was confirmed in the assessment of the probation and parole officer, who reported to his Honour in a pre-sentence report that the respondent was unsuitable to be placed on a community service order because of his ill health and would be unable to perform any of the work component of periodic detention. Those observations for present purposes sufficiently describe the respondent’s personal physical condition. 
      
       
      
     12     
     The next matter to which reference should be made is the discount on sentence to which the respondent would be entitled as a result of his assistance to police authorities. It was common ground before the trial judge that the respondent had readily admitted his participation in the offences charged against him and there was a letter of comfort attached to the affidavit of Donald Bailey, the Police Commander of the Wollongong Local Area Command, which showed that the respondent had given significant assistance in a matter not connected with the charges against him. His Honour made reference to this and to the consequences of it and again found that he had been subjected to threats of a real nature and, once again, there has been no challenge offered to his Honour’s finding in that regard. 
      
       
      
     13     
     The law in relation to the imposition of sentence for offences such as the present is clear and this Court has said over and over again, that offences of taking part in the supply of prohibited drugs must attract full time custodial sentences, unless exceptional circumstances can be shown. 
      
       
      
     14     
     His Honour clearly found that these circumstances were exceptional and, as a principal submission, counsel for the respondent has asserted that no error is demonstrated in that finding. I regard counsel’s submission as correct. 
      
       
      
     15     
     If one combines what might be described as the relatively - and I emphasize relatively - minor participation of the respondent in the offence, together with the discount on sentence that he would be entitled to as a result of his significant and real assistance to authority, and if one takes into account in accordance with proper authority the condition of the respondent, it seems to me that that combination must attract the description of exceptional in the relevant sense. 
      
       
      
     16     
     Absent that combination, I would have been of a view that the sentence was manifestly inadequate but, as the sentencing judge remarked, the circumstances were most unusual and I would add that they were exceptional. 
      
       
      
     17     
     I therefore come to the conclusion that this appeal should fail and I would propose the Crown appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
      
     18     
     MEAGHER JA: I agree. 
      
       
      
     19     
     BERGIN J: I agree.

    IN THE SUPREME COURT REVISEDOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONAT BROKEN HILLGRAHAM BARR JThursday, 13 July 200070077/99 - REGINA v Amos Charles KELLYSENTENCE1   HIS HONOUR: At the commencement of his trial for murder, the offender, Amos Charles Kelly, pleaded guilty of manslaughter and the Crown accepted his plea in full discharge of the indictment. The offender and the deceased, Neal Mitchell, resided in Dareton. On 5 November 1998 the offender, the deceased and a number of other people were at the house of a relative of the offender, GraceAnne Smith, in Dareton. They sat around until a late hour drinking. One of the party was Sabana Quayle, the offender’s partner. The atmosphere at Ms Smith’s house was pleasant and there were no arguments. 
     
      
    2   The offender went home by himself. Some time later, Ms Jennifer Wise, Ms Quayle’s sister, went to Ms Smith’s house and decided to walk her home. They left Ms Smith’s house and were accompanied by the deceased. The three arrived at the offender’s house some time after 2am. The offender was in the kitchen cooking a meal for himself. The deceased went into the kitchen and an argument arose between the two of them. I am satisfied that the deceased started the argument, but just why it started is not clear. Ms Quayle and Ms Wise gave statements about the matter to the police but they could shed no light on the reasons and the only account that suggests any explanation is that of the offender himself. I am satisfied that he did his best to explain what had happened. The deceased said something to him about his, the offender’s, being jealous and told him not to be jealous. The offender did not understand what the deceased was talking about and tried to take no notice. In an effort placate the deceased he said he was sorry and denied having said anything to suggest that he was jealous. The deceased started pushing him. 
     
      
    3   The deceased’s aggression caused the offender concern, not only because the deceased was a heavy man and the offender a slight man but because of a particular susceptibility the offender had to head injuries. In 1994 he had suffered serious injuries when he was assaulted and kicked in the head. He was taken to Mildura Base Hospital and then to the Royal Adelaide Hospital. A serious subdural haematoma developed and had to be drained a number of times. Eventually the drain was successful and the consequent brain swelling reduced, but the offender was left with a serious indentation in the region of the right temple and weakness in the right upper and lower limbs. Those disabilities were permanent and he was advised to be careful to avoid head injury. He believed that he might suffer severe consequences, even death, from a blow to the head. 
     
      
    4   The attack from the deceased was unexpected and the offender had little time in which to act. When he realised that the deceased intended to continue the attack and whilst he was still on his feet the offender moved a few steps to an open kitchen drawer and took up his fishing knife. He threatened to use it on the deceased if he did not stop the attack but did not at that stage try to defend himself with the knife. The deceased responded by pushing him over. The offender hit his head and cut it as he fell. He found himself on the floor with the deceased standing over him with every appearance of continuing the attack. The offender thrust the knife at him a number of times and seven wounds resulted. One of them penetrated the heart and quickly led to the death of the deceased. The offender immediately left the knife where it was, ran next door and telephoned for the ambulance. That call alerted the police, of course, and when they arrived he told them straight away that he was the one who had stabbed the deceased. 
     
      
    5   Some few hours later he was formally interviewed by investigating police officers and gave them an account consistent with the findings I have made. It is significant, I think, that it was almost as an afterthought that he mentioned his concern for his own safety because of the condition of his head and that he did not try to put it forward as an excuse. I am satisfied that his concern on that account was genuine. 
     
      
    6   The offender pleaded not guilty when arraigned in February 2000 and this matter was listed for trial. Both sides then had available to them a transcript of the interview between the offender and the police. However, it now appears that part of the conversation was not transcribed because it was not recorded on audio tapes which were stopped during an interruption to the interview and from which the transcript was prepared. However, the conversation was recorded on the video tape, which continued to run during that interruption. 
     
      
    7   The new material caused both sides to reconsider their positions and that explains why the plea of guilty of manslaughter came to be made and accepted only as the trial was about to commence. In the circumstances the offender is entitled to be regarded as having pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity. 
     
      
    8   The parties made alternative submissions about the proper basis for a conviction of manslaughter. Mr Parker, for the offender, submitted that on all the evidence the Court should have a reasonable doubt that when he stabbed the deceased the offender intended to cause him grievous bodily harm, so the manslaughter should be regarded as having been committed by the offender’s unlawful and dangerous act. The Crown contended that the Court should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to do the deceased grievous bodily harm when he used the knife. The parties were agreed that if the Court were so satisfied, the proper basis for sentencing would be manslaughter resulting from the provocative act of the deceased. 
     
      
    9   In support of his submissions, Mr Parker pointed to the facts that the deceased had started the argument and had turned the attack from a verbal to a physical one and to the peculiar concern the offender had for his own safety, all of which I accept. Counsel then pointed to a part of the conversation between Detective Senior Constable Sikkema and the offender, previously untranscribed, viz - 
     
      
       
        
        ACCUSED: He’s the eldest, then the second eldest is me sister, me, then my younger brother and step brother. Oh mate, I didn’t know. 
         
         
        SIKKEMA: I’m sure you didn’t mean to. 
         
         
        ACCUSED: I didn’t mean it either. Just, you know scaring him. Oh gee listen, look this is on video man, oh, I’m fucked. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        ACCUSED: I didn’t mean it. I didn’t mean it. I’m fucked I’m in the middle of it. That knife’s too long, sort of must have a soft gut. Thought I’d just pierce him, you know. Bit of a look and blood. But how could I kill him. That fuckin must have hit him in the right spot. … 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        ACCUSED: … I want no-one to take pity on me, you know, anyone. I did it. I done it. That’s it. But I didn’t mean to the way it happened. I didn’t mean to do it in that way, in that situation, you know. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        SIKKEMA: What did you hit your head on? 
         
         
        ACCUSED: On the fucking wall. 
         
         
        SIKKEMA: Then he’s pushing you, then he comes over and belts you. 
         
         
        ACCUSED: I got up, grabbed the knife and he pushed me again. He was on top of me, standing on top of me. I hit him before I hit the ground. He pushed me away. Give him a little jab but you know. He came round. He stood over the top of me, trying to belt me. I don’t know how many times. That quick. I was stirred up to it. 
         
        
       
      
    10   Also recorded in the transcript produced by the police are the following questions and answers - 
     
      
       
        
        Q. 28 What can you tell me about the death of Neil Mitchell? 
         
         
        A. Well, he … Well I went home, right, I went home and him and Sabana come to the home, he said somethin’ to me, knocked me to the ground, I got up, I grabbed a knife, pushed him and I stabbed him with the knife, pushed me over at the same time, he stood over the top of me and I was pumpin’ the knife into him while he’s over the top of me that’s all I can say. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Q49 … 
         
         
        A Yeah, well, I got up, went to get up and I said sorry to him, I said, “Look, I’m not jealous or nothin, I’m just, you know, I’m drunk,” like that there, he pushed me over and I went to the drawer, grabbed the knife, pushed me over again then he got ….he stood on top of me, that’s when I got blood all over me. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Q58 And when you got the fishing knife what did you do? 
         
         
        A I said to him, “You want this here mate, if you keep fuckin’ over me you’ll get this here”, he downed me and then he stood over the top of me, shoved it up in his gut. 
         
         
        Q59 When you say he downed you, what do you mean by that? 
         
         
        A He downed me, cut me head open and all here. 
         
         
        Q60 How did he cut your head open? 
         
         
        A ………………..against the wall. 
         
         
        Q61 I’m sorry? 
         
         
        A Against the wall. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Q88 Was it your intention to kill Neil? 
         
         
        A No. 
         
         
        Q89 Were you aware that Neil may have been killed when you stabbed him? 
         
         
        A No. 
         
         
        Q90 Were you aware Neil may have received a serious injury when you stabbed him? 
         
         
        A Yes, a bit of a injury, yeah, I thought, stitches or something in the gut, but I didn’t think, you know. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Q99 Had you ever had any sort of fight with Neil before? 
         
         
        A No. 
         
         
        Q100 Why would Neil think you were jealous of something, had something happened before? 
         
         
        A No. 
         
         
        Q101 Had there been any dispute between yourself and Neil in regards to women? 
         
         
        A No. 
         
         
        Q102 And you can’t think why -------- 
         
         
        A No, I can’t. I tell you the truth, he, he called me a jealous cunt, right, he said, “Why are you jealous? Don’t be jealous”, he suddenly push me over, I said, “I hate people pushin’ me over”, ‘cause I got a sick head, see, I’m a disability person, see that dent there in my head, see ------ 
         
         
        Q103 Yeah 
         
         
        A See that’s why I’m fucked one side here. 
         
         
        Q104 Why have you got a dent in your head? 
         
         
        A When I got kicked in the head, blood clot on my brain, I even died over it, he brought me back to life. 
         
         
        Q105 Was that injury playing on your mind this evening? 
         
         
        A Yes. It does when people hit me around, see I don’t like it. If they hit me right or push me in the right spot, I’m gone, I’m dead. 
         
         
        Q106 And where did Neil push you? 
         
         
        A Push me, grab me, push me, stood over me. 
         
         
        Q107 And how many times did you think that Neil pushed you? 
         
         
        A Twice. 
         
        
       
      
    11   It was submitted that, taking all these matters into account and making due allowance for the effects upon the offender of the alcohol he had drunk, there was a reasonable possibility that all the offender had intended was to cause some injury that was not really serious. 
     
      
    12   I am unable to accept that submission. The knife had a long, sharp blade, as the offender knew. He made seven thrusts with it. His description of himself as “pumpin’ the knife into him” was apt. All the thrusts were directed at the chest or the abdomen. Whilst four of them produced only superficial wounds, three produced deep wounds, any of which might have been fatal. One penetrated to four centimetres, one to twelve centimetres and one to seventeen centimetres. I think it significant also that soon after the event the offender told the neighbour whose telephone he had used to summon the ambulance that he had stabbed the deceased, and added - 
     
      
       
        
        He shouldn’t have messed with me. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    13   I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on all the evidence that although the offender did not intend to kill the deceased he did intend to do him really serious injury. I propose to sentence him for manslaughter because his act causing death was the result of a loss of his self-control induced by the provocative attack made upon him by the deceased. 
     
      
    14   The offender is Aboriginal. He is thirty years old and has lived all his life in the far west of New South Wales. He lost his father through death and his mother, because she moved away, at a young age, but has always had the nurture and companionship of his wider family, particularly of his aunt Mrs Beryl Philp-Carmichael, the head of his extended family in the Broken Hill-Menindee area. She knows him possibly better than anyone apart from her own son, with whom he has been very friendly since they were children. 
     
      
    15   The offender has expressed his anguish to Mrs Philp-Carmichael about having caused the death of the deceased. She considers him genuine, and so do I. He has a criminal record which but for one matter I regard as irrelevant in view of the urgent and unexpected circumstances in which this offence took place. The one matter is that in 1989 he was convicted of malicious wounding. I conclude that the offence was not regarded by the sentencing court as a very serious one of its kind because the offender was sentenced only to three hundred hours’ community service. Mrs Philp-Carmichael explained that the offender stabbed his brother. He was an older, bigger man who regularly stood over the offender and had done so from an early age. The circumstances of the wounding were otherwise left unexplained. What is clear is that this is not the first time the offender has resorted to the use of a knife when threatened with violence by a stronger person. 
     
      
    16   Counsel referred the Court to a number of authorities dealing with the principles to be applied when sentencing for manslaughter, including special considerations to be borne in mind when offenders are Aboriginal, and particularly for offences committed under the influence of alcohol. It is sufficient to refer to the remarks of Wood J (as his Honour then was) in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 at 62 - 
     
      
       
        
        (B) The relevance of the Aboriginality of an offender is not necessarily to mitigate punishment but rather to explain or throw light on the particular offence and the circumstances of the offender. 
         
         
        (C) It is proper for the court to recognise that the problems of alcohol abuse and violence which to a very significant degree go hand in hand within Aboriginal communities are very real ones and their cure requires more subtle remedies than the criminal law can provide by way of imprisonment. 
         
         
        (D) Notwithstanding the absence of any real body of evidence demonstrating that the imposition of significant terms of imprisonment provides any effective deterrent in either discouraging the abuse of alcohol by members of the Aboriginal society or their resort to violence when heavily affected by it, the courts must be very careful in the pursuit of their sentencing policies to not thereby deprive Aboriginals of the protection which it is assumed punishment provides. In short, a belief cannot be allowed to go about that serious violence by drunken persons within their society are treated by the law as occurrences of little moment. 
         
         
        (E) While drunkenness is not normally an excuse or mitigating factor, where the abuse of alcohol by the person standing for sentence reflects the socio-economic circumstances and environment in which the offender has grown up, that can and should be taken into account as a mitigating factor. This involves the realistic recognition by the court of the endemic presence of alcohol within Aboriginal communities, and the grave social difficulties faced by those communities where poor self-image, absence of education and work opportunity and other demoralising factors have placed heavy stresses on them, reinforcing their resort to alcohol and compounding its worst effects. 
         
        
       
      
    17   In my opinion the level of culpability of the offender was low in view of the following features. 
     
      
       
      1. The violent confrontation which led to the death of the deceased was not of the offender’s making. He was peaceable and bore the deceased no ill-will. 
       
       
      2. His actions were not premeditated and were carried out over a very short period of time. 
       
       
      3. It was the deceased who increased the level of confrontation by beginning to push or punch the offender. Even so, the offender tried to placate him. 
       
       
      4. The offender reasonably believed that, because of the condition of his head, he had a particular need to stop the deceased proceeding further with his attack. 
       
       
      5. Although he knew what he was doing and was able to act rationally, the offender was significantly affected by alcohol and lacked the capacity to make fine judgments. 
       
       
      6. He was immediately sorry for what he had done and tried to get help for the deceased. He has always acknowledged his responsibility and entered his plea of guilty of manslaughter at the earliest opportunity. 
       
      
    18   The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 6 November 1998. Between that day and February 2000 he was kept at Broken Hill where he could be visited by members of his family. Then he was taken to Sydney to be arraigned and that was when the trial date was fixed. I recommended that he be returned to Broken Hill as soon as possible and held there until the commencement of the trial. Notwithstanding that recommendation he has been required to spend the intervening period at Silverwater, over one thousand kilometres away from his family. Only one sister, who is resident in Sydney, has been able to visit him. This has been a matter of particular hardship for him. It and the possibility that he may again be so far removed from his family make for a more lenient sentence. 
     
      
    19   It seems to me that the offender needs a lengthy period of time under supervision on parole outside the prison environment to learn to control his anger, to mitigate his consumption of alcohol and to avoid becoming involved in confrontations and that this justifies the fixing of a non-parole period which is less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence. 
     
      
    20   A victim impact statement has been received from Mrs Doreen Mitchell, the mother of the deceased. She and her family loved their son and miss him very much. It is appropriate to acknowledge the hurt and suffering that they have borne and will bear and for the Court to extend to them its sympathy in their loss. Of course, these matters may not be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed. 
     
      
    21   Amos Charles Kelly, I sentence you to imprisonment for seven years, commencing 6 November 1998 and expiring on 5 November 2005. I fix a non-parole period of three and one-half years, which will expire on 5 May 2002, on which day you will be eligible for release on parole. I recommend that you be kept at Broken Hill for classification and for the service of your sentence.

      REGINA v Arthur Frank HARVEY 
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
     1     
     FITZGERALD JA: 
      The circumstances giving rise to this proceeding and the issues raised are discussed in the reasons for judgment of Sperling J. 
      
       
      
     2     
     I agree with his Honour that, although not a bare courier, the applicant was correctly sentenced on the basis that his criminality was broadly similar to that of a courier. The drug of which he had possession, amphetamine, has been classified as a “mid-range” drug in contrast to “high-range” drugs such as heroin. As a result, the guidelines established by  
     Wong, Leung and Law 
      (1999) NSWCCA 420. 
      are not directly applicable. 
      
       
      
     3     
     Nonetheless, the applicant argued that the sentence which he received can be seen to be excessive by reference to those guidelines. I agree with Sperling J that that submission, which is detailed in his Honour’s judgment, was based on a misunderstanding of the decision of this Court in  
     Wong, Leung and Law 
     . 
      (1999) NSWCCA 420. 
       
      
       
      
     4     
     I also agree with Sperling J that, for the reasons which he has given, the applicant’s submissions that the sentencing judge failed to apply s 16G of the  
     Crimes Act 
      1914 (Cwth) and that the applicant’s sentence failed to take account of the fact that he was found guilty of an attempt to obtain possession, not possession, should be rejected. 
      
       
      
     5     
     In my opinion, there is no disconformity between the sentence imposed on the applicant and the guidelines established by  
     Wong, Leung and Law 
      (1999) NSWCCA 420. 
      or the pattern of sentencing established by the other cases relating to mid-range drugs to which the Court’s attention was directed. 
      
       
      
     6     
     I agree with the orders proposed by Sperling J. 
      
       
      
     7     
     SPERLING JA 
     : On 22 April 1999, at a trial in the District Court, the applicant was found guilty of the following offence: 
      
       
        
         
         That on 5 November 1997 he did without reasonable excuse attempt to obtain possession of prohibited imports consisting of a quantity of amphetamine being not less than the trafficable quantity applicable to amphetamine which had been imported into Australia. 
         
        
       
      
     8     
     The offence is prescribed by s 233B(1)(c) of the  
     Customs Act 
       
     1901 
      (Cth). The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 25 years or both: s 235(2)(d)(i). 
      
       
      
     9     
     The trafficable quantity for amphetamine is 2gm. The amphetamine of which the applicant attempted to obtain possession weighed 403 grams, 51.3gm pure (being the relevant weight). There were 1508 tablets. The consignment had a street value of about $42,000.  
      
       
      
     10     
     On 11 June 1999, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years with a non parole period of two years and thirty-three weeks. 
      
       
      
     11     
     The facts are as follows. On 30 October 1997, a parcel was intercepted at Melbourne airport. It was found to contain amphetamine tablets in plastic bags. Officers of the Australian Federal Police substituted iron and calcium tablets, placed fluorescent powder on the substituted packets and placed a listening device in the packet. On 5 November 1997, a police officer, masquerading as an Australia Post employee, delivered the package to the applicant. On the same date, the police raided the premises. The parcel had been opened. There were yellow spots on the accused hands from the fluorescent powder. He was arrested. 
      
       
      
     12     
     The sentencing judge found that the applicant’s role was to receive the amphetamine and to hold it for the person or persons who had arranged the importation.  
      
       
      
     13     
     The crown submits that this finding placed the applicant in the role of a middle-man in the hierarchical structure of the importation. I disagree. The role of receiving and holding for others involved no more responsibility, in this case, than that of a bare courier.  
      
       
      
     14     
     The crown submits that the applicant’s role was analogous to that of the applicant in  
     R v Kovacs 
     . 
      [2000] NSWCCA 74. 
      In  
     Kovacs 
     , the applicant did have a similar role to that of the present applicant. Simpson J (with whom the other members of the court agreed) said that it was not appropriate to characterise the applicant as a courier, his role being to take possession of the drug for the purpose of disseminating it into the community. However, because it was not possible to determine the applicant’s role, other than that it was not that of a courier, he could not, it was said, be treated as having a higher level of responsibility. The same must said of this case. The applicant was merely to receive the amphetamine and hold it for collection by some other person or persons. That involved no more responsibility than that of a bare courier. In neither case does the offender play a part in the planning or organisation of the enterprise. That is the reason, in both cases for categorisation at the lowest level of responsibility in the hierarchy of the criminal enterprise.  
      
       
      
     15     
     In  
     R v Wong and Leung 
      [1999] NSWCCA 420. 
      this Court laid down guidelines for sentencing couriers and other persons low in the hierarchy of an organisation for offences involving the importation of heroin and cocaine. A guideline range of five to seven years was set for head sentences for offences involving a “low level” trafficable quantity (2 to 200gm). 
      
       
      
     16     
     A distinction has been recognised by the courts, for sentencing purposes, between high-range drugs such as heroin and cocaine and mid-range drugs such as amphetamines: see  
     R v Bimahendali 
      [1999] NSWCCA 409, [16]. 
      and the cases cited there. The result is that penalties are expected to be somewhat less for offences involving mid-range drugs than for offences involving high-range drugs:  
     Bimahendali 
     . 
      [1999] NSWCCA 409, [21]. 
      I very much doubt that this is a correct approach in view of the detailed way in which the parliament has promulgated a regime of maximum penalties for such offences, involving specified quantities in relation to each drug, with some variations, but otherwise making no distinction between the drugs specified. The parliament may have made all the distinctions intended to be recognised between particular drugs or classes of drug. No distinction between high and mid-range drugs is made as such in the legislation. But the distinction is now so entrenched that a departure from that approach should not, in my view, be entertained now without the benefit of full argument, preferably by way of a guideline judgment to complement  
     Wong and Leung 
     . A full argument on the point was not heard in the present proceedings.  
      
       
      
     17     
     Accordingly, I will, for the purposes of the present case, recognise amphetamine as a mid-range drug, attracting less criminal responsibility than for the same and cognate offences involving heroin or cocaine.  
      
       
      
     18     
     The applicant argues, first, that the sentencing judge failed to apply s16G of the  
     Crimes Act 
       
     1914 
      (Cth) which requires the court to adjust the head sentences where the sentences will be served in a state where remissions are not available. New South Wales is such a state. The settled reduction is one-third. Alternatively, it was said the sentencing judge failed to disclose what reduction he had made pursuant to s16G and what considerations he had brought to bear. 
      
       
      
     19     
     The sentencing judge said he took s16G into account. So it was not overlooked. The sentencing judge is a very experienced judge. I do not doubt that the head sentence he fixed was after a reduction of one-third from a higher starting point. The exercise is so commonplace and the approach so well settled that there was no need for him to spell out what he did in this regard and why. 
      
       
      
     20     
     Secondly, it was argued that the sentence was excessive having regard to  
     Wong and Leung 
     . 
      [1999] NSWCCA 420. 
      It was submitted the guideline sentences set in  
     Wong and Leung 
      were before any s 16G reduction and, accordingly, that the guideline range for a “low level” trafficable quantity of five to seven years was equivalent to a head sentence range of approximately three and a half to four and a half years after reduction pursuant to s 16G. That, it was argued, put the head sentence of five years in the present case at the top or above the relevant guideline range. 
      
       
      
     21     
     The submission involves an incorrect reading of  
     Wong and Leung 
     . The guideline sentencing ranges in that case were after reduction pursuant to s 16G. That is clear from the language of the joint judgment in the promulgation of the guidelines, in the discussion which precedes the determination of the guidelines, and from the sentences in the earlier cases which were taken into account and are reflected in the guidelines.  
      
       
      
     22     
     Thirdly, it was submitted that a sentence for the offence of attempting to obtain possession should be lower than for the offence of having possession, and that the sentencing judge failed to implement that approach.  
      
       
      
     23     
     Section 233B(1)(c) creates both the offence of obtaining possession and the offence of attempting to do so. There is no warrant for making a distinction between the two offences in the present case. The legislation has made no such distinction in fixing the maximum penalties for the two offences. Whether there are cases where such a distinction should be made is unnecessary to decide. In the present case, the applicant’s activities and intent and the outcome of the enterprise would have been no different if the police had left the drugs in place and had raided the premises after the parcel had been opened as and when they did. There was, therefore, no less criminal responsibility for the attempt in this case than there would have been if the applicant had actually obtained possession. 
      
       
      
     24     
     What was said in  
     R v Lam 
     , 
      (1991) ACrimR 118, 119-120.  
      in  
     R v Ferrer-Esis 
      (1991) 55 ACrimR 231, 239.  
      and  
     R v Lawless 
      Unreported, NSWCCA, 24 June 1994. 
      concerning responsibility for the offence of possession relative to the offence of importing (also a s 223B(1) offence) supports my approach.  
      
       
      
     25     
     No specific error is, therefore, demonstrated in the sentencing process. It is, nonetheless, argued that the sentence was manifestly excessive. I disagree for the reasons which follow. 
      
       
      
     26     
     Recognising the entrenched distinction between high and mid-range drugs, to which I have referred, the guidelines in  
     Wong and Leung 
     , which relate to the high-range drugs, heroin and cocaine, are nonetheless applicable, with caution:  
      R v Bigic 
     . 
      [2000] NSWCCA 9. 
       
      
       
      
     27     
     The head sentence in the present case was at the very bottom of the guideline range for a corresponding offence involving a high-level drug. It was also somewhat less than sentences upheld in this court in materially similar cases:  
     R v Benais 
      [1999] NSWCCA 236.  
      (six years);  
     Bimahendali 
      [1999] NSWCCA 409, [21]. 
      (six years). 
      
       
      
     28     
     There were subjective considerations in mitigation in this case, which the sentencing judge recognised. On the other hand, there was a history of prior offences, including drug offences.  
      
       
      
     29     
     In these circumstances, the sentence was concordant with the proper application of sentencing principles. Indeed, it was not a particularly heavy sentence for the offence, having regard to the objective facts of the case and subjective considerations.  
      
       
      
     30     
     I propose that leave to appeal against sentence be granted and that the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       
      
     31     
     WHEALY J: 
      I agree with the reasons of Sperling J and the orders that he proposes.

     SOLOMONS v DISTRICT COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES & ORS 
    The issue in this case was whether a District Court Judge had power to grant a certificate under s2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW) in respect of proceedings for the prosecution on indictment of a person charged with a Commonwealth offence. Section 2 of the Costs Act gave the court “in any proceedings relating to any offence” the power to grant to the defendant a certificate provided, inter alia, that the defendant was acquitted in circumstances where, had all the relevant facts been known, institution of the proceedings by the prosecution would not have been reasonable. Such a certificate then enabled the defendant to apply for payment of costs incurred in the proceedings. Section 39(2) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) stated: “The several Courts of the States shall within the limits of their several jurisdictions … be invested with federal jurisdiction …” subject to certain exceptions. Section 68(1) provided for the application, to persons charged with Commonwealth offences, of State laws respecting the arrest and custody of offenders and the procedure for their trial and conviction. Section 68(2) stated that State courts exercising jurisdiction with respect to the trial and conviction on indictment of persons charged with State offences should, subject to the section and s80 of the Constitution, have “the like jurisdiction with respect to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth”. Section 79 made State laws, where applicable, binding on State courts exercising federal jurisdiction except as otherwise provided for by the Constitution or Commonwealth laws. Costs ActHeld: (by Mason P, Sheller JA, and Foster AJA)The words “proceedings relating to any offence” in s2 of the Costs Act refer only to proceedings of a State court exercising State jurisdiction in relation to a State offence. Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW), s12(1), applied.Combined effect of the Costs Act and the Judiciary ActHeld: Section 68 of the Judiciary Act1. Section 68(1) of the Judiciary Act is confined in its scope to “the procedure for … trial and conviction on indictment”. This is incapable of picking up the provisions of the Costs Act because that Act is not a law respecting trial procedure (so held by Mason P and Foster AJA, Sheller JA dissenting).2. The Costs Act does not form a necessary part of the State court’s jurisdiction with respect to trial and conviction on indictment and accordingly s 68(2) does not apply (so held by Mason P and Foster AJA, Sheller JA dissenting).Section 79 of the Judiciary Act3. The scope of s79 of the Judiciary Act is limited by its ability to only pick up State laws with their meaning unchanged. As surrogate Commonwealth law, the Costs Act would not extend to offences arising under Commonwealth laws (so held by Mason P).Pederson v Young (1964) 110 CLR 162, applied.4. An application under the Costs Act is not incidental to the federal jurisdiction invested in the Judge and is not picked up by s79 of the Judiciary Act (so held by Foster AJA).Legislation:Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)Customs Act 1901 (Cth)Interpretation Act 1987Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth)Law Reform (Limitation of Actions) Act 1956Suitors’ Fund Act 1951Supreme Court Act 1970Cases Cited:Ah Yick v Lehmert (1905) 2 CLR 593Australian Postal Commission v Dao [No 2] (1986) 6 NSWLR 497Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [1999] HCA 9, 161 ALR 399; 73 ALJR 522Breavington v Godleman (1998) 169 CLR 41Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Owens (1953) 88 CLR 67Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Owens [No 2] (1953) 88 CLR 168Felton v Mulligan (1971) 124 CLR 367Fencott v Muller (1983) 152 CLR 570Gould v Brown (1998) 193 CLR 346Gurnett v The Macquarie Stevedoring Company Pty Limited [No 2] (1956) 95 CLR 106John Robertson & Co Ltd (In Liq) v Ferguson Transformers Pty Ltd (1973) 129 CLR 65Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (1996) 189 CLR 51LNC Industries Ltd v MBW (Australia) Ltd (1983) 151 CLR 575Maguire v Simpson (1977) 139 CLR 362Peel v The Queen (1971) 125 CLR 447Pedersen v Young (1964) 110 CLR 162R v Moffatt [1998] 2 VR 229Re Wakim; ex parte McNally (1999) 73 ALJR 839Rohde v Director of Public Prosecutions (1986) 161 CLR 119Seaegg v The King (1932) 48 CLR 251The Commonwealth v Mewett (1997) 191 CLR 471The Queen v Bull (1974) 131 CLR 203The Queen v Murphy (1985) 158 CLR 596Williams v The King [No 1] (1933) 50 CLR 536Williams v The King [No 2] (1934) 50 CLR 551

     SOLOMONS v DISTRICT COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES & ORS 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1    MASON P: At issue is the power of the District Court to grant a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (the Costs Act) to a person tried and acquitted in that Court on an indictment charging offences under a Commonwealth Act. 
     
      
    2    I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Sheller JA which sets out the facts and statutory provisions and discusses the leading cases. 
     
      
    3    In my view the summons should be dismissed. 
     
      
    4    The starting point is the Costs Act. On its true construction, this Act speaks only to the Courts of New South Wales; and the reference in s2 to “any offence” is to be read as a reference to an offence arising under the common law or a New South Wales enactment. This limited ambit of s2 is confirmed by s12(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987. 
     
      
    5    Of course, the mere fact that such a prosecution involved the exercise of federal jurisdiction would not take the matter outside the primary scope of the Costs Act, because it is well known that federal jurisdiction will spring up as soon as a party invokes an issue involving the Constitution or a federal Act (LNC Industries Ltd v BMW (Australia) Ltd (1983) 151 CLR 575). 
     
      
    6    Does federal law change this? 
     
      
    7    The claimant invokes provisions of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), especially ss39(2), 68 and 79. 
     
      
    8    So far as presently relevant, s39(2) and s68(2) deal with the investing of federal jurisdiction in State courts. Section 68(2) supplements the general provisions of s39(2). In the present case, it invested the District Court of New South Wales with federal jurisdiction in relation to the claimant’s trial on indictment for offences arising under s233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901. Whether s68(2) has impact upon the present matter is a question to which I shall return. 
     
      
    9    Section 68(1) and s79 address the content of the law to be applied in the exercise of federal jurisdiction in different, but overlapping, situations. In their application to State courts, the two provisions are expressly limited to the exercise of federal jurisdiction. They thereby ensure that the confines of Commonwealth legislative power are not exceeded, because s77(iii) of the Constitution, which confers power to make laws investing any court of a State with federal jurisdiction, applies only “with respect to” any of the nine matters mentioned in s75 and s76 of the Constitution. The extent to which s51(xxxix) of the Constitution may confer ancillary power to invest federal jurisdiction is an unresolved question on which conflicting opinions have been expressed (see The Queen v Murphy (1985) 158 CLR 596 at 613-4). What is clear is that: 
     
      
       
        
        …the power conferred by s77(iii) is limited by the principle, which has been distilled from Ch III and the dispositions it makes with respect to the judicial power, that only judicial functions and functions incidental thereto may be invested in a State court ( 
        The Queen v Murphy 
         at 614) 
        . 
        
       
       
      
    10    Within their constitutional and statutory limits, s68(1) and s79 incorporate State enactments by reference and cause them to become, for the purpose of the exercise of federal jurisdiction, “surrogate Commonwealth law” (Murphy J used this expression in: Maguire v Simpson (1977) 139 CLR 362 at 408).  
     
      
    11    It is convenient to look first at s79. Section 79 is not confined to State and Territory courts, nor is it limited to procedural laws. 
     
      
    12    There is, however a presently relevant limitation in the scope of s79. Section 79 “does not purport to do more than pick up State laws with their meaning unchanged” (Pedersen v Young (1964) 110 CLR 162 at 165. See also Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Owens [No 2] (1953) 88 CLR 168 at 170; Maguire at 376; The Commonwealth v Mewett (1997) 191 CLR 471 at 556). 
     
      
    13    This limitation precludes s79 from drafting the Costs Act into federal service as regards a Commonwealth offence. That is because, as surrogate Commonwealth law, the Costs Act would still not extend to offences arising under laws of the Commonwealth (see par 4, above). 
     
      
    14    Section 68(1) supplements s79 in incorporating by reference State laws “so far as they are applicable” to persons such as the claimant. But s68(1) is narrower in its terms than s79. (That is not to say that it excludes s79, but merely that s68(1) as an independent enactment has a narrower scope than the later provision.) That narrower scope is relevantly confined to “the procedure for … trial and conviction on indictment” . This is incapable of picking up the provisions of the Costs Act because that Act cannot be characterised as a law respecting trial procedure. It is true that s2 of the Costs Act confers a power which is exercisable “in” any proceedings relating to any offence, but that does not convert s2 or the Costs Act as a whole into a matter of procedure. The Costs Act confers a substantive right against a non-party exercisable (relevantly) “where a defendant, after a hearing on the merits, is acquitted or discharged as to the information then under inquiry” (emphasis added). 
     
      
    15    Does s68(2) take the claimant any further? As indicated above, the primary operation of that subsection is to invest or confer jurisdiction. However, enactments may have a double function of dealing with substantive liabilities or substantive legal relations and of granting jurisdiction with reference to them (R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte Barrett (1945) 70 CLR 141; Re McJannet; Ex parte Minister for Employment, Training and Industrial Relations for the State of Queensland (1995) 184 CLR 620 at 655).  
     
      
    16    The case law relating to s68(2) illustrates that, in the conferring of federal jurisdiction involving a Commonwealth offence, rights may incidentally be given to both the prosecutor and the defendant. For example, rights of appeal conferred by a State enactment may be made applicable to federal offences by s68(2) (see Peel v The Queen (1971) 125 CLR 447, Rohde v Director of Public Prosecutions (1986) 161 CLR 119). As Sheller JA demonstrates, the judgments in Williams v The King [No 1] (1933) 50 CLR 536 (“Williams [No 1]”) and Williams v The King [No 2] (1934) 50 CLR 551 (“Williams [No 2]”) explain how this comes about through the conferral on State Courts exercising State jurisdiction with respect to trial on indictment etc of “the like jurisdiction” with respect to persons charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. 
     
      
    17    In Williams [No 2] Dixon J said (at 561): 
     
      
       
        
        When sec 68(2) speaks of the ‘like jurisdiction with respect to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth,’ it recognises that the adoption of State law must proceed by analogy. 
        
       
       
      See also  
      Williams [No 1] 
       at 543 (Starke J), 549 (Evatt and McTiernan JJ);  
      Rohde 
       at 124 (Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson J) for other references to adoption of State law by analogy. 
       
      
    18    The claimant submits that he is seeking merely to apply the Costs Act by analogy. This throws up the statutory and constitutional ambit of s68(2), a topic upon which the Court received comparatively little assistance. (The State of New South Wales declined the opportunity to put submissions, leaving it to the Crown in right of the Commonwealth to assist the Court in a matter in which its interest as contradictor is difficult to perceive.) 
     
      
    19    Following the decision in Seaegg v The King (1932) 48 CLR 251, s68 of the Judiciary Act was amended (by the Judiciary Act 1932): 
     
      
       
        
        (a) by inserting in sub-section (1) after paragraph (c) the following paragraph: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “and (d) the hearing and determination of appeals arising out of any such trial or conviction or out of any proceedings connected therewith”; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (b) by inserting in sub-section (2), after the word “State” (second occurring) the words “, and with respect to the hearing and determination of appeals arising out of any such trial or conviction or out of any proceedings connected therewith,”. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    20    The words “out of any proceedings connected therewith” in each added provision clearly qualify “appeals” and thereby identify an extended category of State appellate jurisdiction made applicable to matters involving persons charged with offences against the law of the Commonwealth. The range of first instance criminal proceedings applied by analogy to federal offences was not enlarged. For present purposes, the field remains that of State Courts “exercising jurisdiction with respect to … the trial and conviction on indictment”. 
     
      
    21    I do not see how an application for the grant of a certificate under the Costs Act is with respect to any part of federal jurisdiction invested by s68. As indicated above, it certainly does not constitute part of the procedure for trial and conviction on indictment (within s68(1)). Nor does it form a necessary part of the jurisdiction with respect to trial and conviction on indictment (within s68(2)).  
     
      
    22    The right of a defendant to apply for a certificate under the Costs Act only arises after acquittal or discharge (Costs Act, s2(a)) and the subject of inquiry is the information available to the prosecutor before the proceedings were instituted (ibid, s3(1)(a)). The application is quite collateral to the trial itself, and its determination (in a lis to which the prosecutor need not be a party) forms no part of the disposition of the trial. 
     
      
    23    In Gurnett v The Macquarie Stevedoring Company Pty Ltd [No 2] (1956) 95 CLR 106 the High Court was considering the role of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales when addressing an application for a certificate under the Suitors’ Fund Act 1951. The majority held that the function of the Full Court under s6(1) of the Suitors’ Fund Act was not “consequential upon and intimately bound up with the disposition of the appeal” to that Court (the words of Dixon CJ (dissenting) at 112). The other members of the High Court regarded the function under the Suitors’ Fund Act as not part of the function of disposing of the appeal (see the passages set out in the judgment of Sheller JA). There are differences between the Suitors’ Fund Act and the Costs Act, but the analysis in Gurnett reinforces the conclusion that the determination of an application under s2 of the Costs Act is not something that should be viewed as part of the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to trial and conviction on indictment, within s68(2) of the Judiciary Act. 
     
      
    24    Australian Postal Commission v Dao [No 2] (1986) 6 NSWLR 497 was solely concerned with the scope of the Suitors’ Fund Act as a matter of State law. The Court of Appeal granted a certificate with respect to a successful appeal from a State Tribunal upon being satisfied that the Tribunal was relevantly a “court” and that the appeal had succeeded on a question of law. The appeal involved the exercise of federal jurisdiction because there was a constitutional point, but this was correctly not seen to be an impediment (although no point appears to have been taken on this account). The matter was subsequently clarified by the insertion of s2(2) into the Suitors’ Fund Act which states in effect that it extends to courts exercising federal jurisdiction. I would venture to doubt whether the amendment was essential in the light of what was done in Dao (No 2) implicitly. But none of this assists the claimant, in my view, because his problem in the present case involves much more than the fact that the trial involved the exercise of federal jurisdiction (see further par 5, above). 
     
      
    25    Because no section of the Judiciary Act has the effect contended for, it becomes unnecessary to consider the power of the federal Parliament to pass a law having the effect of imposing a financial liability upon a State with respect to the default of a federal prosecutor in proceedings involving an offence under a law of the Commonwealth. If that power were in issue the matter could be tested by asking about the validity of a federal enactment passed in the terms of the Costs Act save for the express inclusion of reference to federal offences. It is difficult to see the constitutional basis for such a provision. These musings should, however cease because no party issued a notice under s78B of the Judiciary Act and because counsel for the active opponent (the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions) did not suggest any deficiency in federal constitutional power. This is hardly surprising and not in any sense discreditable. 
     
      
    26    The summons should be dismissed with costs. 
     
      
       
      SHELLER JA:  
       
      INTRODUCTION 
       
      
    27    On 22 July 1998 the claimant, Cecil Gregory Solomons, was found not guilty of two counts of being knowingly concerned in the importation of a trafficable quantity of ecstasy pursuant to s233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). The claimant applied to the trial Judge, Judge Keleman SC, for a certificate under s2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967, a State Act. The learned Judge refused that application because, in his opinion, the court had no power to grant such a certificate in respect of proceedings for the prosecution on indictment of a person charged with a Commonwealth offence. In coming to that conclusion, his Honour relied upon Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Owens [No 2] (1953) 88 CLR 168 (Owens [No 2]). The claimant, after considerable delay, applied by summons for an order setting aside the trial Judge’s decision and remitting the application to the District Court to be considered according to law. The application was made pursuant to s69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 and was for relief in the nature of certiorari.  
     
      
    28    As filed, the only opponent to the summons was the Queen in right of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions had prosecuted the claimant. When the hearing of the appeal began, the claimants sought and obtained leave to add the District Court of New South Wales as an opponent. The District Court filed a submitting appearance. During the hearing of the appeal, following the Court’s suggestion, the claimant was granted leave to join the State of New South Wales, which appeared by a solicitor who announced that the State wished to make no submission in the matter. No party submitted that the application involved a matter arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation; s78B(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). I do not think notices under that section were required to be given. The application involved the proper construction and effect of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act and the Judiciary Act.  
     
      
       
       
      THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION 
       
      
    29    The Costs in Criminal Cases Act provided, at the relevant time, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “2. The Court or Judge or Justice or Justices in any proceedings relating to any offence, whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, may - 
        
       
       
        
        (a) where a defendant, after a hearing on the merits, is acquitted or discharged as to the information then under inquiry; or 
         
        (b) where, on appeal, the conviction of the defendant is quashed and - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the defendant is discharged as to the indictment upon which he or she was convicted; or 
           
          (ii) the information or complaint upon which the defendant was convicted is dismissed, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in section 3 and relating to those proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        3. (1) A certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court or Judge or Justice or Justices granting the certificate - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings; and 
           
          (b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) A certificate granted under this Act by a Justice or by Justices shall specify the amount of costs that the Justice or Justices would have adjudged to be paid if the Justice or Justices had made an order for costs against the informant, prosecutor or complainant, as the case may be. 
        
       
       
        
        3A. (1) For the purpose of determining whether or not to grant a certificate under section 2 in relation to any proceedings, the reference in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 3 to all the relevant facts is a reference to such of the relevant facts as were established in those proceedings together with such further relevant facts as the defendant, on the application for the certificate, has established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Justice or Justices. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Where, on an application for a certificate under section 2 in relation to any proceedings, the defendant adduces evidence to establish further relevant facts that were not established in those proceedings, the Court or Judge or Justice or Justices to which or to whom the application is made may - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) order that leave be given to the prosecutor in those proceedings or, in the absence of the prosecutor, to any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application, to comment on the evidence of those further relevant facts; and 
           
          (b) if the Court, Judge, Justice or Justices, think it desirable to do so after taking into consideration any such comments, order that leave be given to the prosecutor or to the person representing the Minister to examine any witness giving evidence for the applicant or to adduce evidence tending to show why the certificate applied for should not be granted and adjourn the application so that that evidence may be adduced. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        4. (1) In this section “Under Secretary” means the Under Secretary of the Department of the Attorney General and of Justice. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Any person to whom a certificate has been granted pursuant to this Act may, upon production of the certificate to the Under Secretary, make application to the Under Secretary for payment from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the costs incurred by that person in the proceedings to which the certificate relates. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Subject to subsection (4), the Under Secretary shall, as soon as practicable after receiving an application under subsection (2), furnish to the Treasurer a statement, signed by the Under Secretary, setting forth the particulars of the application and the certificate to which it relates and specifying - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) (i) where an amount for costs has been specified in the certificate pursuant to subsection (2) of section 3, the amount so specified; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) where an amount for costs has not been so specified, the amount that, in the opinion of the Under Secretary, would reasonably have been incurred for costs by the applicant in the proceedings to which the certificate relates; and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) any amounts which, in the opinion of the Under Secretary, the applicant has received or is entitled to receive or would, if the applicant had exhausted all relevant rights of action and other legal remedies available to the applicant, be entitled to receive, independently of this Act, by reason of the applicant’s having incurred those costs. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4) The Under Secretary may defer furnishing to the Treasurer any statement under subsection (3) for as long as the Under Secretary considers it necessary to do so to enable the Under Secretary to specify the amounts referred to in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a), and paragraph (b), of that subsection. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) Where the Treasurer, after receiving the Under Secretary’s statement relating to any such application, considers that, in the circumstances of the case, the making of a payment to the applicant is justified, the Treasurer may pay to the applicant his or her costs or such part thereof as the Treasurer may determine. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) Any payments under subsection (5) may be made without further appropriation than this Act. 
        
       
       
        
        5. (1) Where payment is made to any person pursuant to section 4, the Under Secretary shall be subrogated, to the extent of the payment, to all the rights and remedies of that person, other than those provided under this Act, to recover costs incurred in the proceedings in respect of which application for the payment was made. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Any moneys recovered by the Under Secretary pursuant to subsection (1) shall be paid to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.” 
        
       
       
      
    30    Section 2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act referred to proceedings relating to any offence. The power to grant a certificate under the Act was vested in the Court or Judge in the proceedings. This at once identified the Court or Judge which had to deal with the application and suggested that the application, though separately initiated, was closely connected with and should be dealt with as part of the proceedings. 
     
      
    31    The criteria for the grant of the certificate, which had to be specified in the certificate, were that it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings if the prosecution had been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts and that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed or might have contributed to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances. In short, the question was whether, if all the relevant facts had been known, the institution of the proceedings would not have been reasonable. The relevant facts were not only those established in the proceedings but also further relevant facts established to the satisfaction of the Court on the application for the certificate. The Court might give leave to the prosecutor or, in the absence of the prosecutor, any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application, to comment on the evidence of those further facts and, in certain circumstances, to examine witnesses and adduce evidence. 
     
      
    32    A successful applicant produced the certificate to the Under Secretary of the Department of the Attorney General and of Justice and applied for payment from the consolidated revenue fund of the costs incurred by that person in the proceedings. The Under Secretary then furnished to the Treasurer a statement setting forth the particulars of the application and the certificate and the Treasurer, after receiving the Under Secretary’s statement, considered it. If the Treasurer considered that the making of the payment to the applicant was justified, the Treasurer might pay to the applicant the applicant’s costs or such part thereof as the Treasurer might determine. 
     
      
    33    The claimant’s primary submission was that the Act applied of its own force to enable Judge Keleman to grant the certificate. Alternatively, the claimant relied upon the Judiciary Act, the relevant sections of which provide as follows:

      FEDERAL JURISDICTION VESTED IN STATE COURTS 
       
      
    34    There is no doubt that the claimant’s trial was conducted by the District Court in the exercise of federal jurisdiction vested in it pursuant to s39(2) and s68(2) of the Judiciary Act by the Federal Parliament under power derived from ss51 (xxxix), 71 and 77(iii) of the Constitution; see The Queen v Bull (1974) 131 CLR 203 at 275 where Mason J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is not the occasion to undertake an exposition of the precise relationship between s39(2) and s68(2) of the  
        Judiciary Act 
        . For present purposes it is sufficient to say that it has been accepted that the specific provision made in s68(2) respecting the conferment of jurisdiction on State courts with respect to persons charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth does not displace, in criminal matters, the general grant of federal jurisdiction which flows from s39(2). ‘To exclude its operation upon any part of federal jurisdiction, more is required than a special provision conferring part of the jurisdiction, either original or appellate, which s39 also confers’.

    35    In Ah Yick v Lehmert (1905) 2 CLR 593 at 603 Griffith CJ said:  
     
      
       
        
        “In the case of the High Court, the extent to which that Court may exercise judicial power is defined by the Constitution; in the case of other courts it is not defined by the Constitution, and must, again of necessity, be defined by the Commonwealth law which creates those Courts or invests them with federal jurisdiction. The term ‘federal jurisdiction’ means authority to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth, and again that must be within limits prescribed.” 
        
       
       
       His Honour continued at 603-4:  
       
       
        
        “Section 75 defines and enumerates five classes of cases in which the High Court has original jurisdiction, and s76 four others in which Parliament may confer original jurisdiction upon the High Court. ...Then s77 provides that Parliament may make laws ‘(i) Defining the jurisdiction of any federal Court other than the High Court’, and ‘(iii) Investing any Court of a State with federal jurisdiction.’ Now, the power to create a federal Court depends upon s71…..Taking s71 into consideration, s77(i) means that the Parliament may establish any Court to be called a federal Court, and may give it jurisdiction to exercise any judicial power of the Commonwealth, which the Parliament may think fit to confer upon it, either by way of appellate or original jurisdiction. Subsection (iii) must receive a precisely similar interpretation. Parliament may invest any Court of a State with authority to exercise federal judicial power, again to the extent prescribed by the Statute.”  
        
       
       
        
       
      
    36    At 605, referring to s39(2) of the Judiciary Act, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “……as to the nine classes of cases enumerated in sections 75 and 76 of the Constitution the several Courts of the State are invested with federal jurisdiction……But the jurisdiction with which those courts are invested is qualified by the words ‘within the limits of their several jurisdictions’……In my judgment, s39 confers authority on each State Court to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth in the enumerated classes of cases, as to all such matters as are in other respects within the limits of its jurisdiction as defined by the State laws by which it is established. And I think that that authority is conferred to the same extent, and for the same purposes, and is to be exercised in the same manner, as if the Court had been established as a federal Court with jurisdiction to exercise the federal judicial power to the extent, and for the purposes, for which it was actually established.” 
        
       
       
      
    37    At 614 Barton J, referring to the expression “whether such limits are as to locality, subject-matter or otherwise”, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “that in using the words ‘or otherwise’ it was intended to apply to the purposes of the section the whole State jurisdiction not already mentioned - the whole of the jurisdiction possessed by any Court of a State, whether that jurisdiction was civil or criminal, original or appellate. …Therefore, I conclude that it was the intention of s39(2) to invest the State Courts with federal jurisdiction, not only as to locality and subject matter, but also as to quality.” 
        
       
       
      
    38    In Seaegg v The King (1932) 48 CLR 251 at 256 the High Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 39(2) does confer upon State Courts Federal jurisdiction coextensive with their State jurisdiction in respect of matters which are, or may be placed, within the original jurisdiction of this High Court: but something further appears to be required to make the State  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
         apply to Federal prosecutions. It has not, so far, been decided that s39(2) can operate to increase or vary the subject matter of the jurisdiction. In the present instance, the subject matter is confined to appeals against convictions upon indictment preferred under State law. It may well be that s39(2) cannot convert the jurisdiction over that subject matter into a Federal jurisdiction over a different subject matter, viz., appeals against convictions upon indictment preferred pursuant to s69 of the Federal  
        Judiciary Act 
         1903-1927.” 
        
       
       
      After that decision, on 5 December 1932, s68 of the  
      Judiciary Act 
       was amended: 
       
        
        “(a) by inserting in sub-section (1) after paragraph (c) the following paragraph: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘and (d) the hearing and determination of appeals arising out of any such trial or conviction or out of any proceedings connected therewith’; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (b) by inserting in sub-section (2), after the word ‘State’ (second occurring) the words ‘, and with respect to the hearing and determination of appeals arising out of any such trial or conviction or out of any proceedings connected therewith,’.” 
        
       
       
      
    39    In Williams v The King [No 2] (1934) 50 CLR 551 the High Court considered whether s68 of the Judiciary Act operated on s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) to enable the Commonwealth Attorney General to appeal on the ground of inadequacy of sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal. That Court had upheld the appeal and increased the sentence. The prisoner sought leave to appeal. One of the grounds of appeal was that the conferring of a right to appeal by s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act on a named officer, the State Attorney General, could not, by analogy, be held to confer a right of appeal on some Commonwealth officer. The Court being equally divided, leave was refused. Dixon J, who would have refused leave and with whose reasons Starke J concurred, said at 558-562: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Section 51 (xxxix) of the Constitution and s77(iii) as construed in  
        Ah Yick v Lehmert 
         confer ample power upon the Parliament to invest the Courts of a State with power to entertain, and to authorize the prisoner or the Crown to take, any proceedings by way of appeal or review in the case of offences against Federal law which the State law allows in cases of offences against State law. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The power or powers derived from s51 (xxxix) and s77(iii) in combination may be exercised by the Parliament without discriminating in its enactment between these sources of authority. The provision should not be referred to s77(iii) alone and construed as doing no more than that power may be considered to authorize. Thus, even if it were correct that s77(iii) is not a source of power to enact new remedies, but only of power to give State Courts a Federal authority to administer existing remedies, it would not follow that s68(2) of the  
        Judiciary Act 
         1903-1932 should receive an interpretation which, with respect to appeals after trial upon indictment, restricted its operation to conferring upon the State Courts capacity to entertain appeals elsewhere given by Federal law to the prisoner or the prosecution. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The provision in s68 upon which the question turns was inserted by Act No 60 of 1932 in consequence of the decision of this Court in  
        Seaegg’s Case 
        . It is, therefore, certain that the amendment was intended to confer upon the Courts of Criminal Appeal of the States a jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals in the case of Federal offences such as existed in the case of State offences and to confer upon prisoners, at any rate, a right to invoke that jurisdiction and to obtain analogous remedies. No construction of the provision should be adopted which defeats that object, unless the language in which it is expressed is found incapable of any construction that would accomplish it. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) To effect the object, the enactment provides that the several Courts of a State exercising jurisdiction with respect to the hearing and determination of appeals arising out of the trial or conviction on indictment, or out of any proceedings connected therewith, of offenders or persons charged with offences against the laws of the State shall have the like jurisdiction with respect to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. Thus, the method pursued is, so to speak, to take up and adopt ‘with respect to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth’ all the jurisdiction of the State Court to hear and determine appeals which answer the description ‘appeals arising out of the trial or conviction on indictment, or out of any proceedings connected therewith, of offenders or persons charged with offences against the laws of the State.’ A provision conferring jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals of a specified kind may, perhaps, be taken to mean to do no more than to say which shall be the Court to entertain appeals and administer the remedies that other provisions of the law give to the party. But it is also open to an interpretation by which it gives a jurisdiction to review proceedings not hitherto subject to appeal and so creates new remedies by conferring power to administer them. The first construction would defeat the clear object of the Legislature. The second would achieve it, and ought, therefore, to be adopted. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) But when this construction is given to the words of the provision, they necessarily extend to all remedies given by State law which fall within the description ‘appeals arising out of the trial or conviction on indictment or out of any proceedings connected therewith.’ This accords with the general policy disclosed by the enactment, namely, to place the administration of the criminal law of the Commonwealth in each State upon the same footing as that of the State and to avoid the establishment of two independent systems of criminal justice. It is, in my opinion, no objection to the validity of such a provision that the State law adopted varies in the different States. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) Section 5D of the New South Wales  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
        , which authorizes the Attorney-General of the State to appeal against any sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal and empowers that Court to impose such sentence as it thinks fit, does give an appeal which falls within the description ‘appeals arising out of the trial or conviction on indictment or out of any proceedings connected therewith.’ The word ‘conviction’ is capable of including sentence, and a construction which confines the description to appeals from verdict and incidental proceedings, and excludes appeals from sentence, appears to me inconsistent with the evident purpose of the Legislature of giving to prisoners, at any rate, the same remedies by way of appeal in the case of Federal offences as exist in the case of State offences. 
        
       
       
        
        (7) I do not think that the contention is well founded that, in spite of the prima facie meaning of the general description, it should be interpreted as relating to appeals by the prisoners only, or as insufficient to include such an innovation as an appeal from sentence by the prosecution. Conceding that such a proceeding is a marked departure from the principles theretofore governing the exercise of penal jurisdiction, it is a departure sanctioned by State law, and it had already been made when the amendment in the provisions of s68(2) was introduced. General words adopting an existing set of provisions of State law appear to me to be of a different order from general words which are not referential, but deal independently with the subject matter. The general language of s3 of the  
        Appellate Jurisdiction Act 
         1876, which enacted that, subject to certain exceptions, an appeal lies to the House of Lords from any order of the Court of Appeal in England, has been held to give no right of appeal from an order for discharge from custody made upon the return of a writ of habeas, although expressed in terms sufficient to do so, because it could not be supposed ‘that a section couched in terms so general availed to deprive the subject of an ancient and universally recognized constitutional right’ (per Lord  
        Birkenhead, Secretary of State for Home Affairs v O’Brien 
         [1923] AC 603 at 610). But such a process of interpretation does not appear to me to be applicable to an enactment dealing with the existing and known provisions of a particular department of the statutory law of the States and by a general description adopting it for Federal purposes. Whatever, upon the natural meaning of the language, falls within the description should, I think, be understood as within the legislative intention. 
        
       
       
        
        (8) The New South Wales section gives the right of appeal against sentence to the Attorney-General of the State. It gives it to him in virtue of his office. He is the proper officer of the Crown in right of the State for representing it in the courts of justice. When s68(2) speaks of the ‘like jurisdiction with respect to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth,’ it recognizes that the adoption of State law must proceed by analogy. The proper officer of the Crown in right of the Commonwealth for representing it in the Courts is the Federal Attorney-General. I do not feel any difficulty in deciding that, under the word ‘like’ in the expression ‘like jurisdiction,’ the functions under s5D of the State Attorney-General in the case of State offenders fall to the Federal Attorney-General in the case of offenders against the laws of the Commonwealth.” 
        
       
       
      
    40    From Dixon J’s judgment can be derived the following principles relevant to this application: 
     
      
    · The general policy disclosed by s68 of the Judiciary Act is to place the administration of the criminal law of the Commonwealth in each State upon the same footing as that of the State and to avoid the establishment of two independent systems of criminal judgment. 
     
      
    · Section 68(2) should not receive an interpretation which restricts its operation to conferring upon the State Courts capacity to entertain applications elsewhere given by federal law to the prisoner or the prosecution.  
     
      
    · General words adopting an existing set of provisions of State law are of a different order from general words which are not referential, but deal independently with the subject matter. An enactment dealing with the existing and known provisions of a particular department of the statutory law of the States and by general description adopting it for federal purposes should include whatever upon the natural meaning of the language falls within the description. 
     
      
    · When s68(2) speaks of the “like jurisdiction with respect to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth”, it recognises that the adoption of State law must proceed by analogy. In Williams v The King [No 1] (1933) 50 CLR 536 at 543 Starke J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A ‘like jurisdiction’ is, I apprehend, a jurisdiction analogous, similar or corresponding to that of the State court in respect of offences against the laws of the State.” 
        
       
       
       
       See also per Evatt and McTiernan JJ at 549 and  
      The Queen v Bull 
       at 258 per Gibbs J. Thus, the functions under a State enactment of the State Attorney General in the case of State offenders fall to the Federal Attorney General in the case of offenders against the laws of the Commonwealth. 
       
      
    · The federal jurisdiction given with respect to trial and conviction on indictment such as existed in the case of State offences would extend at least to confer upon the accused a right to invoke remedies available to a State accused. In this regard, I think, one can take account of the language of para (d) added to s68(1) by the 1932 amendment, which dealt with appeals arising not only out of any such trial or conviction but also “out of any proceedings connected therewith”.  
     
      
    · The interpretation was open and should be adopted that s68(2) created new remedies by conferring authority to administer them. When this construction is given to the words of the section, they necessarily extend to all remedies given by State law which fall within the relevant description. 
     
      
    41    In Williams v The King [No 2] the Court being equally divided in opinion, the order was made in accordance with s23(2)(a) of the Judiciary Act. Speaking of a like situation in Gould v Brown (1998) 193 CLR 346 Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Re Wakim; ex parte McNally (1999) 73 ALJR 839 at 860: 
     
      
       
        
        “That is, there was no opinion on the issues raised that was an opinion commanding the assent of a majority of the Court. It follows that, although the decision in  
        Gould v Brown 
         disposed finally of the appeal and bound other courts in Australia to arrive at a like result on the issues it dealt with, it established no principle or precedent having authority in this Court.” 
        
       
       
      
    42    However, the High Court has applied what Dixon J said; see Rohde v Director of Public Prosecutions (1986) 161 CLR 119 at 124-5. Accordingly, for present purposes it seems to me to matter not, unless there was some inconsistency, that the power to grant a certificate and its consequences found in the Costs in Criminal Cases Act is not found in federal law or that the prosecutor is a federal officer. On the other hand I do not think that the process of analogy can extend to converting the claim on State consolidated revenue to a claim on Commonwealth consolidated revenue. Obviously, s4(6) of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act can only appropriate from State consolidated revenue;  compare ss53 and 54 of the Constitution. 
     
      
       
        
       
      OWENS [NO 2] 
       
      
    43    In Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Owens (1953) 88 CLR 67, the Commissioner of Stamp Duties successfully appealed in the High Court against a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The respondents were ordered to pay the costs of the appeal and applied to the High Court (Owens [No 2]) for a certificate under the Suitors’ Fund Act 1951 (NSW). Section 6 of the Suitors’ Fund Act, as then in force, provided that where an appeal against the decision of any court on a question of law succeeded, the court determining the appeal might grant to the respondent thereto a certificate, which the section called an indemnity certificate. Subsection (2) then enacted that such a certificate should entitle the respondent to be paid from the Suitors’ Fund the costs which he might be ordered to pay, and paid, to the appellant and the costs of the appeal incurred by the respondent, the whole not to exceed £500. Subsection (3) provided as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where a court of appellate jurisdiction (in this subsection referred to as the ‘court of higher appellate jurisdiction’) grants an indemnity certificate to the respondent to the appeal heard by it, an indemnity certificate granted previously to any person who is a party to such appeal by a court of lower appellate jurisdiction in the appeal or series of appeals which preceded the appeal to the court of higher appellate jurisdiction shall be vacated.” 
        
       
       
      
    44    At 169, the High Court (Dixon CJ, Williams, Webb, Fullagar and Kitto JJ) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 6 operates to impose upon the courts to which it applies a duty to hear and consider applications for indemnity certificates and to exercise a judicial discretion in granting or refusing them. It is apparent that this Court, the jurisdiction of which depends upon the Constitution of the Commonwealth and the laws validly made thereunder, could not in such a matter be affected by an exercise of the authority of the State legislature. It is therefore not a court to which s6(1) of its own force can apply. Nor is there any reason to think that the term ‘Court’ in s6(1) was intended to include the High Court of Australia. No one could suppose that the general words of s5 were used with any idea that they would cover proceedings in the High Court and that no doubt is true of the word ‘Court’ in s6(1). But in any case, since s6 cannot apply to the High Court, it follows that, on ordinary principles, it should not be construed as intending to do so.” 
        
       
       
      
    45    The argument was put that s6 was a law of the State of New South Wales which was made binding on the High Court, as a court exercising federal jurisdiction, by s79 of the Judiciary Act. Their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 79 has, in our opinion, no bearing on the matter. The function which s6 imposes upon State courts forms a step in the machinery provided for indemnifying an unsuccessful litigant in respect of costs out of a fund set up and administered by the State. That is outside the scope of s79. The purpose of that section is to adopt the law of the State where federal jurisdiction is exercised as the law by which, except as the Constitution or federal law may otherwise provide, the rights of the parties to the  
        lis  
        are to be ascertained and matters of procedure are to be regulated. 
        
       
       
        
        Whether or not s79 applies to the appellate jurisdiction of this Court, it is no part of its purpose to pick up, so to speak, a provision of State law imposing on State courts such a function as that assigned to them by s6(1) and convert it into a provision imposing a like function on federal courts. The circumstance that an application for a certificate of indemnity is made consequential upon the litigation does not alter the character of that proceeding and certainly is not enough to bring it within s79. It forms no part of the subject matter with which s79 deals.” 
        
       
       
      
    46    In addressing the proposition that New South Wales legislation of its own force could affect the High Court, the Court held that the Suitors’ Fund Act could not apply to impose upon it a duty to hear and consider an application by a respondent under the Act in the case where an appeal against the decision of a State court on a question of law succeeded in the High Court.  
     
      
    47    With respect to the meaning and operation of both the Suitors’ Fund Act and s79 of the Judiciary Act, the focus was on whether either the State Act or the Federal Act imposed a duty under the Suitors’ Fund Act on the High Court. The Court held that they did not. In Gurnett v The Macquarie Stevedoring Company Pty Limited [No 2] (1956) 95 CLR 106 at 110, Dixon CJ said that Owens [No 2] was concerned with a claim to indemnity out of the fund in respect of costs incurred in the High Court, not in respect of costs incurred in the court from which the appeal came to the High Court. The question which Gurnett’s Case raised was whether the function which s6 of the Suitors’ Fund Act confided to the Supreme Court lay outside the ambit of the power of the High Court, in the language of s37 of the Judiciary Act, to confirm, reverse or modify the judgment appealed from and give such judgment as ought to have been given in the first instance (see 111). In dissenting from the opinions of the other members of the Court, the Chief Justice at 112 said: “The function under the Suitors’ Fund Act is new but it is consequential upon and intimately bound up with the disposition of the appeal.”  
     
      
    48    The other members of the Court regarded the function under the Suitors’ Fund Act as not one part of the Court’s disposing of an appeal. At 115 McTiernan J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 6(1) of the  
        Suitors’ Fund Act 
         does not make the function of granting an indemnity certificate one to be performed by the appellate court in the course of determining the appeal. The words ‘the court determining the appeal’ are a description of the court in which the discretion to grant or refuse an indemnity certificate is vested. …. In my judgment, upon the true construction of the  
        Suitors’ Fund Act 
        , the right of a respondent to an indemnity certificate arises after the determination of the appeal, if it succeeds.” 
        
       
       
      Similarly, at 117 Williams J said: 
       
        
        “The question whether the Supreme Court should grant or refuse a certificate is a question entirely collateral to the subject matter under appeal.” 
        
       
       
      At 117-118 Webb J emphasised that on an application for a certificate to the Supreme Court, only the applicant was entitled to be heard. The application was outside the limits of the contest between the parties. At 119, Taylor J said: “At the most it is, it seems to me, a collateral function and the grant of a certificate forms no part of the judgment disposing of any such appeal.” 
       
      
    49    In both Owens [No 2] and Gurnett, the High Court was concerned with its own function under federal law in disposing of an appeal. In Owens [No 2], the question was whether the Suitors’ Fund Act affected the High Court by requiring it where it allowed an appeal to consider an application for an indemnity certificate by an unsuccessful respondent. The Court considered that s79 of the Judiciary Act had no bearing on the matter. In Gurnett’s Case the question was whether, as part of allowing an appeal from the Supreme Court and giving such judgment as ought to have been given in that Court, the High Court should consider granting a certificate to the unsuccessful respondent in that Court.  
     
      
    50    The present case is not about the imposition of a function imposed by State law upon the High Court or federal courts. In proceedings relating to any State offence, the District Court of New South Wales was clothed by the State Act with authority to grant certificates under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act. The question is whether the vesting in the District Court of jurisdiction to try federal offences embraces or pursuant to s79 of the Judiciary Act picks up that authority and, by analogy, enables the Court to grant such certificates in federal prosecutions. It is not decisive or even relevant that the State Act does not by its own language purport to apply to federal proceedings. With due respect, I do not think that either Owens [No 2] or Gurnett assists in resolving this question. 
     
      
       
       
      THE COMPOSITE LAW APPLICABLE 
       
      
    51    In Pedersen v Young (1964) 110 CLR 162 the Court was concerned with a defence under the Queensland Law Reform (Limitation of Actions) Act 1956 raised in proceedings brought in the High Court in the New South Wales registry. At 167-8 Menzies J said:  
     
      
       
        
        “As at present advised I do not think the laws of a State relating to proceedings in State courts cannot apply in this Court by virtue of ss79 and 80 merely because, upon their true construction, as State Acts they relate only to the courts of the State. It may well be a part of the office of ss79 and 80 to make applicable in this Court some State statutes which, upon their true construction, apply of their own force only to courts governed by the laws of the State in which the court is exercising its federal jurisdiction although it is clear that some such statutes are outside the scope of these sections:  
        Owens [No 2] 
        .” 
        
       
       
      
    52    State courts have found no difficulty, when exercising federal jurisdiction vested in them, in granting certificates under s6 of the Suitors’ Fund Act; see for example, Australian Postal Commission v Dao [No 2] (1986) 6 NSWLR 497, a case decided before the 1987 amendment of the Suitors’ Fund Act inserting subs 2(2) which provided that the Act applied to and in respect of a court exercising State or federal jurisdiction. In the Second Reading Speech of the Amending Bill, the Attorney General said that the amendment would “confirm that the Act has application to proceedings involving an exercise of federal as well as State jurisdiction.” 
     
      
    53    Section 68 of the Judiciary Act, as its title states, concerns the jurisdiction of State and Territory courts in criminal cases. Subsection (2), in combined operation with s39(2), vests analogous, similar or corresponding jurisdiction, described as “the like jurisdiction”, in the several courts of a State exercising jurisdiction with respect to the trial and conviction on indictment of persons charged with offences against the laws of the State, subject to the section and s80 of the Constitution, “with respect to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth”. The subsections that follow subs (2) descend to some particularity about the nature and extent of that jurisdiction. 
     
      
    54    In Felton v Mulligan (1971) 124 CLR 367 at 393 Windeyer J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In most cases where there is a conflict between rights, whether of appeal or otherwise, arising under federal and State law the question is resolved by s109 of the Constitution. In other cases it seems to me that the difficulty need not really arise. The existence of federal jurisdiction depends upon the grant of an authority to adjudicate rather than upon the law to be applied or the subject of adjudication. But once a court is duly seised for adjudication of a matter arising under a Commonwealth law, it seems to me impossible to say that it is not exercising federal jurisdiction and that the provisions of s39(2) of the  
        Judiciary Act 
         are not to apply” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    55    Having quoted this passage in Fencott v Muller (1983) 152 CLR 570 at 607, Mason, Murphy, Brennan and Deane JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Subject to any contrary provision made by federal law and subject to the limitation upon the capacity of non-federal laws to affect federal courts, non-federal law is part of the single, composite body of law applicable alike to cases determined in the exercise of federal jurisdiction and to cases determined in the exercise of non-federal jurisdiction (cf  
        Felton v Mulligan 
         at 392 and 399). 
        
       
       
        
        It follows also that, though the facts upon which a non-federal claim arises do not wholly coincide with the facts upon which a federal claim arises, it is nevertheless possible that both may be aspects of a single matter arising under a federal law.” 
        
       
       
      
    56    In R v Moffatt [1998] 2 VR 229 at 248 Hayne JA, as his Honour then was, referred to such expressions as: 
     
      
       
        
        “there being in this country what Deane J described in  
        Breavington v Godleman 
         (1988) 169 CLR 41 at 134 as ‘a comprehensive and truly unitary system of substantive law’ or there being an ‘integrated Australian judicial system for the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth’ (as to which see  
        Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) 
         (1996) 189 CLR 51 per Gaudron J at 102; per Gummow J at 137-8); or there being a single common law of Australia as opposed to the common law of individual States ( 
        Kable 
         per McHugh J at 113)….” 
        
       
       
       At 249, referring to  
      Kable 
      , his Honour said: 
       
       
        
        “All of the judges who decided the case accepted that the State courts are the creatures of the States and that when the Commonwealth invests judicial power of the Commonwealth in a State court, it must take that court ‘constituted and organised as it is from time to time’ ( 
        Kable 
         per Brennan CJ at 67) and must, at least in that sense, take the State court ‘as it finds it’ ( 
        Federated Sawmill, Timber Yard and General Workers Employees Association v Alexander 
         (1912) 15 CLR 308 at 313 per Griffith CJ).” 
        
       
       
      
    57    A State court invested with jurisdiction by subs (2) must apply the laws of the State respecting the arrests and custody of offenders or persons charged with offences and the procedure for their trial and conviction on indictment “so far as they are applicable to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth in respect of whom jurisdiction is conferred … by [s68]”; see subs (1). 
     
      
    58    In the Second Reading Speech on the introduction of the Costs in Criminal Cases Bill, the Minister of Justice referred to the prerogative of the Crown not to pay costs and the practice of the Crown not to seek to receive them and the view that the awarding of costs to a successful accused would place a prize of cash, either to be deprived from one party or gained by another and would remove the essential impartiality from a criminal proceeding. The Minister said that the proposed legislation: 
     
      
       
        
        “departs from the old English conception that costs in criminal trials should only be awarded in exceptional cases. On the other hand it establishes criteria which, when applied judicially, permit courts to make orders in appropriate cases without any innuendo arising from the making, or the refusal to make such orders that would be critical either of the prosecutor or the accused.” 
        
       
       
      
    59    Standing alone, I do not think one would read s2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act when it speaks of proceedings relating to any offence as referring to other than proceedings of a State court exercising State jurisdiction in relation to a State offence. The limited ambit of s2 alone is confirmed by s12(1) of the Interpretation Act 1987 which provides that a reference to a statutory body is a reference to a statutory body in and for New South Wales and a reference to a jurisdiction or other matter or thing as a reference to such jurisdiction or other matter or thing in and of New South Wales. No more before its amendment would one read s6 of the Suitors’ Fund Act as referring other than to proceedings in which the State court was exercising State jurisdiction.  
     
      
    60    But it should be observed first that the Costs in Criminal Cases Act did not discriminate between proceedings brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions, a police officer or a private citizen, or relating to any offence, whether punishable, summarily or upon indictment.  
     
      
    61    Secondly, only the Federal Parliament can impose upon a State court federal jurisdiction to entertain the prosecution of an offence against federal law. The District Court of New South Wales is a court in which the Judiciary Act has invested such federal jurisdiction. What s2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act made plain was that the court which exercised the power there conferred was doing so “in” proceedings relating to an offence. The court in those proceedings, faced with an application for a certificate under the Act, was bound to decide in terms of the Act whether to grant a certificate. That was an integral part of the court’s authority in State prosecutions and was, in my opinion, appropriately translated to federal prosecutions by the vesting of the “like jurisdiction with respect to persons” charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. 
     
      
    62    A separate and independent question is whether s79 of the Judiciary Act picked up and made binding on the State court exercising federal jurisdiction in that State the Costs in Criminal Cases Act. Did that Act become a surrogate law of the Commonwealth? Section 79 could not operate to pick up some but not all of the otherwise applicable terms of the New South Wales Act, for to do so would be to give an altered meaning to the State legislation: see Maguire v Simpson (1977) 139 CLR 362 at 376 and The Commonwealth v Mewett (1997) 191 CLR 471 at 556. But the Costs in Criminal Cases Act could be applied in a federal prosecution in the District Court without any alteration of meaning. The process that followed the grant of a certificate applies unchanged. Recourse is had to the consolidated revenue fund of the State. 
     
      
       
       
      CONCLUSION 
       
      
    63    In the present case, in my opinion, the District Court had authority to adjudicate upon the application for a certificate in the proceedings on indictment against the claimant. No provision of the Federal law was inconsistent with or contrary to the provisions of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act. Had the Judge been exercising State jurisdiction, the Judge had power to grant a certificate under the Act. By analogy the Judge remained clothed with that power in the federal proceedings. 
     
      
    64    The State of New South Wales, although joined, put no argument. The Crown in right of the Commonwealth was the lone contradictor. As I have said, the Costs in Criminal Cases Act did not, nor could it, enable money to be appropriated from Commonwealth consolidated revenue. But the process provided by the State under the legislation enabled recourse to be made by the claimant against State consolidated revenue. 
     
      
    65    The application to this Court was brought after considerable delay. The claimant proffered an explanation for this in an affidavit of 16 December 1999, the contents of which were not challenged. None of the opponents is shown to have suffered any prejudice by the delay. The delay should not, in my opinion, operate to deny the claimant relief.  
     
      
    66    I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Bring up the record of the District Court relating to the application of Cecil Gregory Solomons for a certificate under the  
        Costs in Criminal Cases Act 
         1967 in proceedings DC 98/11/0264; 
        
       
       
        
        2. Order that the order made by his Honour Judge Keleman SC on 24 July 1998 refusing the application be quashed; 
        
       
       
        
        3. Order that the application be remitted to the District Court to hear and determine the matter of the application to that court for a certificate under the  
        Costs in Criminal Cases Act 
         by the said Cecil Gregory Solomons according to law; 
        
       
       
        
        4. Order that the opponent, the Crown in right of the Commonwealth pay the claimant’s costs of the summons. 
        
       
       
      
    67    FOSTER AJA:  This is an application brought pursuant to s69 of the Supreme Court Act, 1970. It seeks relief in the nature of certiorari in respect of a judgment given in the District Court of New South Wales Criminal Jurisdiction by Keleman DCJ on Friday, 24 July 1998.  
     
      
    68    His Honour had presided over a trial in which the applicant, Cecil Gregory Solomons had been found not guilty, by direction, in respect of two counts of being knowingly concerned in the importation of a trafficable quantity of the drug ecstasy, pursuant to s233B (1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) (“The Customs Act”). After the claimant had been so acquitted, he made application to the judge for a certificate under s2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW) (“The Costs Act”). His Honour refused this application on the basis that, the prosecution having been brought under the Commonwealth Act, and, consequently, having been dealt with by the court in the exercise of federal jurisdiction, he lacked jurisdiction to grant the relief sought. It is asserted by the claimant that his Honour was in error and that, he had, as a matter of law, the necessary jurisdiction to hear and determine the application.  
     
      
    69    The relevant sections of the Costs Act are set out in full in the judgment of Sheller JA and I shall not set them out again in these reasons. I shall later refer to their effect.  
     
      
    70    It was submitted on behalf of the claimant that the Costs Act applied by its own force, to the proceedings for the prosecution of the claimant under the Customs Act. I am in agreement with Mason P and Sheller JA that this submission must be rejected. The Costs Act can apply, in itself, only to proceedings heard in the Courts of New South Wales; furthermore, the words in s2 ""any proceedings relating to any offence"" refer to an offence defined by the common law or prescribed by a New South Wales Statute (Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW), s12(1)). 
     
      
    71    The question is, therefore, whether any provisions of federal law can produce the result that the Costs Act is rendered applicable to the situation of the claimant's acquittal of the charge brought pursuant to the Customs Act.  
     
      
    72    It is clear, of course, that the New South Wales District Court had jurisdiction to hear the charge against the claimant as a result of its being invested with federal jurisdiction for this purpose. Its jurisdiction to do so was provided by the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (“the Constitution”) and the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (“the Judiciary Act”). Section 71 of the Constitution provides, so far as relevant, that ""The judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in …such other courts as [the Parliament] invests with federal jurisdiction. …"". Section 77 (iii) makes further provision in this regard. It provides, so far as relevant, that the Parliament may make laws investing any court of a State with Federal jurisdiction with respect to any of the matters mentioned in ss75 and 76 of the Constitution. Section 76(ii) provides for the conferring of jurisdiction in respect of any matter ""arising under any laws made by the Parliament.""  
     
      
    73    Pursuant to this Constitutional power the Parliament has conferred Federal jurisdiction on State Courts by the enactment of ss39 and 68 of the Judiciary Act.  
     
      
    74    Section 39 (2) relevantly invests State Courts ""within the limits of their several jurisdictions, whether such limits are as to locality, subject-matter, or otherwise"" with ""federal jurisdiction, in all matters in which the High Court has original jurisdiction or in which original jurisdiction can be conferred upon it…"".  
     
      
    75    Section 68 of the Judiciary Act makes additional provision in respect of the criminal jurisdiction to be exercised by State Courts in relation to offences created by Commonwealth legislation. Section 68 (2) provides, so far as relevant, as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""The several Courts of a State …exercising jurisdiction with respect to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) …. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) …. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the trial and conviction on indictment; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        of offenders or persons charged with offences against the laws of the State …shall …have the like jurisdiction with respect to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth."" 
        
       
      
    76    In dealing with the claimant in respect of the charge laid pursuant to s233 B (1)(d) of the Customs Act, the District Court was exercising jurisdiction pursuant to these sections. The question for determination in this appeal is whether his Honour was correct in holding that the application made to him on behalf of the claimant under the Costs Act fell outside the jurisdiction he was so exercising.  
     
      
    77    Connected with this question are considerations as to whether s68(1) and s79 of the Judiciary Act have the effect of bringing within the ambit of the jurisdiction so exercised applications under the Costs Act, notwithstanding that such applications, considered alone, relate only to offences cognisable under State jurisdiction.  
     
      
    78    Section 68 (1), so far as relevant provides as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""The laws of a State …respecting (the arrest and custody of offenders or) persons charged with offences, and the procedure for: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) their trial and conviction on indictment;… 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        shall, subject to this section, apply and be applied so far as they are applicable to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth in respect of whom jurisdiction is conferred on the several courts of that State…by this section."" 
        
       
      
    79    Section 79, so far as relevant, provides as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""The laws of each State…including the laws relating to procedure, evidence, and the competency of witnesses, shall, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution or the laws of the Commonwealth, be binding on all Courts exercising federal jurisdiction in that State…in all cases to which they are applicable."" 
        
       
      
    80    In my view s68 (1), as a matter of construction, is not capable of conferring upon the District Court jurisdiction to entertain an application under the Costs Act. Such an application, in my opinion, cannot be regarded as falling within the concept of ""procedure for…trial and conviction on indictment.""  
     
      
    81    However, s79 casts a wider net. Although the laws referred to include those relating to procedure, evidence and competency of witnesses, they are not restricted to those categories. If the Costs Act is otherwise ""applicable"" and not excluded by the Constitution or the laws of the Commonwealth, it can be ""picked up"" by the section and converted into a ""surrogate Commonwealth law"" (per Murphy J, Maguire v Simpson (1976-1977) 139 CLR 362 at 408), notwithstanding that it can apply, by its own force, only in respect of offences under New South Wales law.  
     
      
    82    It is necessary to consider the effect of decisions dealing with the operation of the section.  
     
      
    83    Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Owens & Anor (1953) 88 CLR 168 was accepted by Keleman DCJ, in the present case, as necessarily excluding jurisdiction under the Costs Act. The High Court had allowed an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, reversing its decision in favour of the respondent. The respondent applied to the High Court for an ""indemnity certificate"" under the Suitors' Fund Act 1951 (NSW) (“the Suitors’ Fund Act), s6 of which authorised the grant by an appellate Court of such a certificate to a respondent, where an appeal had succeeded on a question of law. The certificate entitled the respondent to be paid, from the Suitors' Fund, costs which he might be ordered to pay to the appellant and also his own costs of the appeal, up to a certain sum. It was held that the Act could not apply, of its own force, to impose upon the High Court a duty to hear and consider an application for such a certificate, nor did s79 of the Judiciary Act require that the New South Wales legislation become binding on the High Court, as a Court exercising federal jurisdiction. The Court said (at 170):- 
     
      
       
        
        ""The function which s6 imposes upon State courts forms a step in the machinery provided for indemnifying an unsuccessful litigant in respect of costs out of a fund set up and administered by the State. That is outside the scope of s79. The purpose of that section is to adopt the law of the State where federal jurisdiction is exercised as the law by which, except as the Constitution or federal law may otherwise provide, the rights of the parties to the 
          
        lis are to be ascertained and matters of procedure are to be regulated. 
        
       
       
        
        Whether or not s79 applies to the appellate jurisdiction of this Court, it is no part of its purpose to pick up, so to speak, a provision of State law imposing on State courts such a function as that assigned to them by s6 (1) and convert it into a provision imposing a like function on federal courts. The circumstance that an application for a certificate of indemnity is made consequential upon the litigation does not alter the character of that proceeding and certainly is not enough to bring it within s79. It forms no part of the subject matter with which s79 deals."" 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    84    It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that Owens is necessarily restricted in its application to situations where the High Court itself is being asked to make an order under the State legislation, the case not being determinative in situations where a State court is exercising federal jurisdiction pursuant to s39 or s68 of the Judiciary Act. Support for this submission is gained from the reasons of Dixon CJ in Gurnett v The Macquarie Stevedoring Co Pty Limited No. 2 (1956) 95 CLR 106 at 110-111, a decision to which I shall return. I indicate at this stage, however, that I agree, with respect, in the reasons given by Sheller JA for holding that Owens is not necessarily dispositive of the question in the present case. 
     
      
    85    The case of Pedersen v Gunn (1964) 110 CLR 162 must next be considered. This was an action for negligence arising out of a motor vehicle accident in Queensland. It was brought in the High Court as an action between residents of different states pursuant to s75(iv) of the Constitution. It was commenced in the New South Wales Registry of the High Court more than three years after the date of the accident alleged in the statement of claim. The defendant, in his defence, relied upon The Law Reform (Limitations of Actions) Act 1956 of the State of Queensland which imposed a relevant limitation period of three years. The plaintiff demurred, asserting that the Queensland statute could afford no defence. The defendant relied upon s79 of the Judiciary Act to “pick up” the Queensland defence.  
     
      
    86    Kitto J held that s79 could not have the effect contended for, even if the action were tried in Queensland. This was so, ""because the Judiciary Act does not purport to do more than pick up State laws with their meaning unchanged."" His Honour cited Owens for this proposition and continued by stating that s79 could not give to the Queensland section ""a new meaning, converting it into a provision limiting the time for the commencement of actions outside Queensland."" He said that ""for that reason"" the Queensland statute did not ""even by force of the Judiciary Act, afford a defence to an action commenced, as the present action was commenced, outside the time it allows but in New South Wales.""  
     
      
    87    It is important, in my opinion, that Kitto J's statement of principle be read as a whole. The portion which refers to the Judiciary Act not purporting ""to do more than pick up State laws with their meaning unchanged"" must be read in context. The statute purported to apply only to actions commenced in Queensland. To extend its operation to actions commenced outside that State would be, necessarily, to change its meaning.  
     
      
    88    The other judgments in the case are instructive. Taylor J, whilst agreeing that the demurrer should be upheld, did so ""on the simple ground"" that the Queensland statute had ""no application to actions properly commenced in this Court in a State other than Queensland."" His Honour preferred to leave unanswered the question of the effect of s79 of the Judiciary Act ""if the action had been commenced in this Court in Queensland.""   
     
      
    89    Menzies J, however, did enter upon a consideration of this question. His Honour said (at 167): 
     
      
       
        
        ""If it should happen that the action is heard and determined in Queensland, this Court will then be exercising its jurisdiction there and such laws of that State as are applicable will apply (Judiciary Act, ss79 and 80). As at present advised I do not think that the laws of a State relating to proceedings in State courts cannot apply in this Court by virtue of ss79 and 80 merely because, upon their true construction, as State Acts they relate only to the courts of the State. It may well be a part of the office of ss79 and 80 to make applicable in this Court some State statutes which, upon their true construction, apply of their own force only to courts governed by the laws of the State in which the court is exercising its federal jurisdiction although it is clear that some such statutes are outside the scope of these sections:  
        Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Owens [No. 2]. 
        ""  
         
        
       
      
    90    Windeyer J did not find it necessary to refer to s79 of the Judiciary Act in reaching his decision. Owen J, however, indicated that had the proceedings commenced in the Brisbane Registry, s79 would have had the effect of making available a defence based upon the Queensland statute ""despite the fact that that section is directed and could only be directed to the barring by lapse of time of actions commenced in the courts of the State of Queensland."" His Honour continued (at 171): 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is plain, that the only actions to which the section applies are those which are commenced in Queensland. This action was not so commenced and for this reason alone I am of opinion that the demurrer should be upheld."" 
        
       
      
    91    I conclude that Pedersen is not authority for a proposition that a State Act such as the Costs Act is not capable of being applied by a Court of that State when exercising federal jurisdiction, simply because, as a matter of construction, the State Act applies, by its own force, only to proceedings in State Courts exercising State jurisdiction. This fact alone does not preclude s79 from operating to convert the State Act into ""surrogate federal law."" 
     
      
    92    In my opinion, the decision of the High Court in John Robertson & Co Limited (In Liquidation) v Ferguson Transformers Pty Limited (1973) 129 CLR 65 supports this view of the operation of s79. The case also involved the provisions of a limitations statute. Proceedings had been commenced in the Adelaide Registry of the High Court and there was an issue as to whether the action was barred by the Limitation Of Actions 1936 of South Australia Act. The situation was, therefore, different from Pedersen in that the action was commenced in the State where the limitation applied. However, the Limitation of Actions Act did not apply, of its own force, to proceedings commenced in the High Court. Menzies J adhered to the views he had expressed in Pedersen. Walsh J (at p 83) said:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""When s79 applies it ‘does not purport to do more than pick up State laws with their meaning unchanged’: see  
        Pedersen v Young 
         (1964) 110 CLR 162 at p.165, per Kitto J. The extent of the operation of State laws governed by s79 is, of course, changed. Its purpose is to extend their operation so that they apply in courts exercising federal jurisdiction in that State."" 
        
       
      
    93    Gibbs J (at p. 88) dealt with the matter in the following passage:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is.. settled, that s79 does not give a new and more extensive meaning to State laws which it renders binding on a court exercising federal jurisdiction; it applies those laws with their meaning unchanged:  
        Commissioner of Stamp Duties (N.S.W.) v Owens [No 2] 
         (1953) 88 CLR 168,  
        Pedersen v Young 
         (1964) 110 CLR at pp 165-166;  
        Re Young's Horsham Garage Pty Ltd 
        , [1969] VR 977 at p 979. To that last proposition it is, however, necessary to add a qualification. Section 79 may render applicable in a court exercising federal jurisdiction a State statute which either by its express provisions or upon its proper construction is limited in its application to the courts of the State: see per Menzies J. in  
        Pedersen v Young 
         (1964) 110 CLR at pp 167-168. If the laws of a State could not apply if, upon their true construction as State Acts, they related only to the courts of the State, it would seem impossible ever to find a State law relating to procedure, evidence or the competency of witnesses that could be rendered binding on courts exercising federal jurisdiction, because most, if not all, of such laws, upon their proper construction, would be intended to apply in courts exercising jurisdiction under State law."" 
        
       
       
      (See also per Mason J at pp 93-95). 
       
      
    94    I note also that in Maguire v Simpson (1976-1977) 139 CLR 362 Gibbs J adhered to his previous view. He said (at 376):- 
     
      
       
        
        ""… s79 ‘does not purport to do more than pick up State laws with their meaning unchanged’:  
        Pedersen v Young 
         (1964) 110 CLR 162 at p.165; and see  
        Commissioner of Stamp Duties (N.S.W.) v Owens [No. 2] 
         (1953) 88 CLR 168 at p.170. It was pointed out in  
        John Robertson & Co Ltd v Ferguson Transformers Pty Ltd  
        (1973) 129 CLR 65 that there is an exception to the generality of that statement; a State law may be rendered applicable by s79 to a court exercising federal jurisdiction, which is not a State court, notwithstanding that the law according to its own terms is limited in its application to the courts of the State."" 
        
       
      
    95    I note, also, what was said by Gummow and Kirby JJ in The Commonwealth of Australia v Mewett (1996-1997) 191 CLR 471 at 556 where, in relation to the application of the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) to proceedings being heard in the Federal Court of Australia sitting in New South Wales, their Honours spoke of the ""regime of extensions of limitation periods"" in the legislative scheme and said:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""Section 79 could not operate to pick up some but not all of the otherwise applicable terms of the NSW Act, for to do so would be to give an altered meaning to the State legislation. This would be in the face of the authorities discussed by Gibbs J in  
        Maguire v Simpson  
        (1977) 139 CLR 362 at 376 
        .""  
        
       
      
    96    There is no suggestion in the present proceedings that an application made to the trial judge under the Costs Act would involve any relevant change in the meaning of that Act. I am, accordingly, of the view that s79 of the Judiciary Act would enable the application to be made unless, in terms of the section, its operation was necessarily excluded. In this regard a State law may be found to be ""not applicable"" (Ferguson Transformers) or excluded by a law of the Commonwealth (Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Limited [1999] HCA 9, 161 ALR 399; 73 ALJR 522). In my view these considerations do not apply in the present case. There is no suggestion that the Costs Act would not, if otherwise available, be ""applicable"", or that any law of the Commonwealth would exclude it from operation.  
     
      
    97    However, regard must be paid to possible exclusionary effects of the Constitution having regard to the fact that the State Court is exercising federal jurisdiction. The vesting of that jurisdiction must, of course, comply with and be circumscribed by the relevant Constitutional sources of power which support it. I have already set out the relevant provisions of the Constitution. To these may be added the ""incidental"" power provided by s51(xxxix).  
     
      
    98    In The Queen v Murphy (1985) 158 CLR 596, the full bench of the High Court considered (at p. 613) the Constitutional parameters of the vesting of State courts with federal jurisdiction. Their Honours said:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""The power given to the Parliament by s77(iii) of the Constitution to make laws investing any court of a State with federal jurisdiction is ‘with respect to’ any of the nine matters mentioned in ss75 and 76. These matters include matters arising under any laws made by the Parliament: s76(ii). To what extent s51(xxxix) of the Constitution may confer ancillary power to invest federal jurisdiction is an unresolved question on which conflicting opinions have been expressed;  
        R. v Murray and Cormie 
        ;  
        Ex parte 
          
        The Commonwealth 
         (1916) 22 CLR 437 at p.452;  
        Lorenzo v Carey 
         (1921) 29 CLR 243 at p.252;  
        The Commonwealth v Limerick Steamship Co. Ltd and Kidman 
         (1924) 35 CLR 69 at pp.105, 115-116;  
        Le Mesurier v Connor 
         (1929) 42 CLR 481 at pp.498, 514. According to the authorities, the power conferred by s77(iii) is limited by the principle, which has been distilled from Ch. III and the dispositions it makes with respect to the judicial power, that only judicial functions and functions incidental thereto may be invested in a State court."" 
        
       
      
    99    It follows, in my opinion, that no State law can be ""picked up"" by s79 unless it is appropriate to the exercise of federal jurisdiction by the State court in question. To be so appropriate it must be integral with the adjudicative process in respect of a ""matter"" referred to in s75 and s76 of the Constitution or be incidental to that process. In the present case the invested federal jurisdiction relates to a matter arising under a law made by the Parliament (s76 (ii)) and the law conferring the jurisdiction, s68(2) of the Judiciary Act, relates, relevantly, to ""trial and conviction on indictment"" (s68 (2)(c)). It is clear that an application under the Costs Act does not form part of any adjudicative process involved in such trial and conviction. The question, therefore, is whether such an application can properly be regarded as “incidental” to such a process. If it is not, then s79 cannot incorporate it in the federal jurisdiction being exercised by the District Court.  
     
      
    100    The answer to this question depends upon a consideration of the significant features of an application under the Costs Act. As it is necessary to consider these features in relation to the question whether s68(2) can operate to include the application under the Costs Act within the federal jurisdiction being exercised by the District Court, I shall defer consideration of this question in relation to s79 until the latter task has been completed. 
     
      
    101    The question arising under s68(2) is whether the expression ""like jurisdiction"", contained therein, is apt to include within the federal jurisdiction exercised by the District Court the power to hear and determine an application under the Costs Act. The effect of the section is that a State court exercising federal jurisdiction in respect of charges relating to offences against the laws of the Commonwealth is to have ""like jurisdiction"" to that of a State court exercising jurisdiction with respect to the trial and conviction on indictment of offenders or persons charged with offences against the laws of the State. In Williams v The King [No 1] (1933) 50 CLR 536 at 560, Dixon J said, in relation to the section, that it ""accords with the general policy disclosed by the enactment, namely, to place the administration of the criminal law of the Commonwealth in each State upon the same footing as that of the State and to avoid the establishment of two independent systems of criminal justice."" 
     
      
      (See also  
      The Queen v Murphy 
       at 617). 
       
      
    102    The expression ""like jurisdiction"" received early consideration in Williams v The King [No. 1] (1933) 50 CLR 536. Starke J at 543 said: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) ‘like jurisdiction’ is, I apprehend, a jurisdiction analogous, similar or corresponding to that of the State Court in respect of offences against the laws of the State.""  
        
       
      
    103    In Williams v The King [No 2] (1934) 50 CLR 551, Dixon J (at 561) agreed with this approach. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""When s68(2) speaks of the 'like jurisdiction with respect to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth’, it recognises that the adoption of State law must proceed by analogy"".  
        
       
      
    104    This view has been consistently followed. In Peel v The Queen (1971) 125 CLR 447 it was held that the section operated upon s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), so as to enable the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against a sentence pronounced by the Supreme Court upon the conviction of a person charged with an offence against Commonwealth law, the majority holding that an approach by way of analogy produced this result. A similar result was arrived at by the same process of reasoning in Rohde v The Director of Public Prosecutions (1986) 161 CLR 119 in respect of a provision of the Crimes Act 1958 (Victoria) comparable to s5D of the NSW Act. 
     
      
    105    Applying this approach in the present case, the question becomes whether an application made under the Costs Act in respect of proceedings relating to an offence under the law of New South Wales can properly be regarded as part of the State Court’s jurisdiction with respect to the trial and conviction on indictment of a person charged with a State offence. The resolution of this question requires a consideration of the features of an application under the Costs Act. This analysis has been undertaken in the judgment of Sheller JA. I shall not repeat what his Honour has done.  
     
      
    106    It is clear that the Costs Act does not give to a defendant, who has been acquitted after a hearing on the merits, any direct right to an order for costs against the prosecution. He has the right to apply for a certificate in a particular form. The application is made to the Court or judge in the proceedings after they have concluded. The application is thus made to the judge who heard or presided over the proceedings and the certificate is granted by the judge ""in"" those proceedings.  
     
      
    107    The certificate, if so granted, states the opinion of the judge that if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all relevant facts it would not have been reasonable to institute proceedings and that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed or might have contributed to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances.  
     
      
    108    The certificate, if granted, also requires the specification by the judge of an amount of costs that would have been ordered if an order for costs against the prosecutor had been made. The ""relevant facts"" refer not only to facts established in the proceedings but any further facts established by the applicant in the making of the application. If such further facts are established the judge may allow the prosecutor or, in his absence, a person authorised by the Minister to comment on the further facts so adduced and, after considering such comments, may give leave to the prosecutor to examine witnesses and adduce further evidence. A certificate given at the end of these proceedings may be produced to the Under Secretary of the Department of the Attorney General and of Justice and an application made for the payment of the amount of the costs from consolidated revenue. Thereafter the Under Secretary is to approach the Treasurer, who has a discretion as to whether payment of the costs should be made to the defendant.  
     
      
    109    Is this application relevantly part of the jurisdiction of the Court in relation to the trial and acquittal of an applicant, or is it separate and distinct from it? 
     
      
    110    In deciding this question, in my opinion, assistance may be gained from the decision of the High Court, in what I consider to be reasonably analogous circumstances in the case of Gurnett v The Macquarie Stevedoring Co. Pty Limited referred to above at [18]. That case involved an application for an indemnity certificate under the Suitors' Fund Act. 
     
      
    111    An appeal had been made to the High Court from an order of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales dismissing an appeal by the appellant, who had been a plaintiff at first instance and against whom a verdict had been entered by direction by the trial judge. The High Court, in upholding the appeal, held that the verdict by direction should not have been given. The order of the Full Court of the Supreme Court was discharged and, in lieu thereof, it was ordered that the appeal to that Court be allowed with costs. The defendant in the action applied to the High Court to vary the cost order by adding a provision granting an indemnity certificate under s6 of the Suitors' Fund Act. This application was made on the basis that the High Court could make such an order in the course of exercising its jurisdiction to give such judgment as ought to have been given in the Court appealed from. It was contended that the Full Court of the Supreme Court, had it upheld the appeal, would have granted such a certificate to the unsuccessful respondent. 
     
      
    112    Dixon CJ was of the view that the variation sought could be granted. He held (at 112) that the application under the Suitors' Fund Act was ""consequential upon and intimately bound up with the disposition of the appeal."" He stated that ""The essence of s6 of the Suitors' Fund Act is to give the State court determining the appeal an ancillary or incidental authority"". He, accordingly, held that the jurisdiction of the Full Court in relation to the appeal included the power to hear and determine an application under the Suitors' Fund Act consequent upon the outcome of the appeal. The other judges of the Court did not agree. McTiernan J held (at 115) that the Suitors' Fund application was ""separate from and subsequent to the appeal"". Consequently the ""appeal to the High Court from the judgment of the Full Court on the motion for a new trial did not bring within the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court the discretion, which the Full Court of New South Wales would have had, to grant or refuse an indemnity certificate, if that motion had succeeded there."" Williams J held (at 117) that the question of the granting or refusing of a certificate by the Supreme Court was a question ""entirely collateral to the subject matter under appeal."" It did not arise between the parties to the appeal at all. Webb J found that the application was outside the limits of the contest between the parties. It was a consequence of the appeal without being incidental to it. He said (at 118) ""The provision in s6 (1) of the Act that the court determining the appeal is to deal with the application for the certificate has not, I think, the purpose of making the application part of the appeal, or an incident of the appeal: it is simply to ensure that the application will be disposed of by judges acquainted with the case."" Taylor J agreed saying that (at 119) the application was not a function exercisable as part of the process of determining the appeal. It was collateral to it.  
     
      
    113    Although an application under the Costs Act is made in different circumstances from an application under the Suitors' Fund Act there are many similarities between them. Each is made to the judge or judges dealing with the substantial matter in which the applicant is involved. The application is made after the conclusion of that matter, be it a hearing at first instance or an appeal. In each case the application is for the exercise of a discretion in favour of the applicant. In the case of the Suitors' Fund the exercise of the discretion in favour of the applicant does not depend upon the merits of the case, it being necessary, only, that a question of law was involved. In respect of the Costs Act, it is necessary that the applicant have been acquitted after a hearing on the merits. In each case the application is made after and is dependent upon the outcome of the main proceedings. In each case the costs, if payable, are paid from a fund not associated with or under the control of the other party to the proceedings. In the case of the Suitors' Fund, the other party has no right or interest to be heard in respect of the application. In the case of the Costs Act, in the circumstances referred to, the prosecutor may be asked to comment, examine the applicant's witnesses, or call rebutting evidence.  
     
      
    114    Do the differences between the two applications produce the result that the application made under the Costs Act is not merely collateral to the prosecution proceedings but is incidental to it, such that the jurisdiction to hear and determine the application is part of the general jurisdiction relating to the prosecution? Can it properly be described as incidental to it? In my view the question arising under s68 (2) in this regard is the same question as arises under s79. Il the Cost Act application incidental to the prosecution brought in exercise of federal jurisdiction or is it merely collateral to and separate from it?  
     
      
    115    I have come to the view that the similarity between the Suitors' Fund Act and the Costs Act applications are of greater significance in determining this matter than are the differences. With respect, I find the reasoning of the majority in Gurnett persuasive and properly capable of being applied in the present proceedings. The jurisdiction to hear and determine an application under the Costs Act could not, in my view, be part of the jurisdiction of the State Court in respect of the trial and conviction or acquittal of the claimant had these proceedings been brought in respect of a State offence. Accordingly they were not part of the “like jurisdiction” conferred by s68(2) of the Judiciary Act, with the result that Keleman DCJ was not authorised by that section to hear and determine them. Nor was the application “incidental” to the federal jurisdiction invested in the judge and, accordingly, was not “picked up” by s79 of the Judiciary Act.  
     
      
    116    For these reasons I agree with Mason P that this summons should be dismissed with costs.

     10054/00 ALBERT AH-SEE v. DAVID HEILPERN and RICHARD MORLEY 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal under Pt 5 of the Justices Act 1902. On 24 August 1999 the plaintiff was arrested by police at Wellington and on 25 August he was brought before the Dubbo Children’s Court and charged with an offence under s 97 of the Crimes Act 1900 (which relates to robbery being armed with an offensive weapon). The particulars alleged that on 24 August he robbed a named Commonwealth Bank officer of $1,698 the property of the Bank while armed with a bladed instrument. The plaintiff was born on 30 August 1981. At the time of the alleged offence he was 17 years of age. By the time of the trial he had turned 18 years of age, and that is his age now. 2   The charge was tried before Mr David Heilpern, Children’s Magistrate in the Children’s Court at Wellington on Monday 6 and Tuesday 7 December 1999, when the offence was found proved. On 23 December 1999 the Children’s Court sentenced the plaintiff to a control order consisting of a minimum term of 15 months and an additional term of nine months pursuant to s 33(1)(g) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW); the control order dated from 24 August 1999. Mr Heilpern has filed a submitting appearance. The second defendant Mr Morley is a Senior Constable of Police at Wellington and the Informant in the Children’s Court. He filed an appearance in this Court and later the Director of Public Prosecutions took over as second defendant in the proceedings. The plaintiff and the Director of Public Prosecutions were each represented by counsel at the hearing of the appeal. 
    3   The substantial issue in the trial was whether the plaintiff was identified as the offender. The evidence of identification on which the learned Magistrate acted was given by two bank officers who were present at the time of the offence; they identified the plaintiff as the offender by reference to picture identification evidence, being photographs shown to them by investigating police. The plaintiff challenges the admission in evidence of the picture identification evidence. If their identifications by reference to picture identification evidence should not have been allowed in evidence, it could not be found that the plaintiff was the offender and the conviction must be quashed. 
    4   The appeal revolves around the admissibility of evidence given by Mr Morley about whether the plaintiff refused to participate in a line-up. The effect of this evidence appears from a passage in para 12 of Mr Morley’s statement dated 20 September 1999; the part of Mr Morley’s evidence based on this statement was not admitted in evidence on the trial of the proceedings but was rejected, but the Magistrate acted on it in a way which shows that it must be taken to have been admitted in evidence for the limited purpose of deciding an objection to the picture identification evidence. The significant passage is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         Attempts to locate relatives for the young person Albert AHSEE failed. About 4.30pm in company with Detective SHARWOOD and ACLO WEST we escorted the young person Albert AHSEE to the interview room in the Detectives Office. I obtained the Young persons details being Albert Keith AHSEE, 3 Simpson Lane Wellington, Date of birth 30/08/81. 
          
         I said, “Albert do you agree that you have requested ACLO WEST to be present as none of your relatives can be found.” 
          
         He said, “I don’t want them sitting around.” 
          
         I said, “Do you agree that you are under 18 and over 16.” 
          
         He said, “Yep.” 
          
         I said, “Do you agree to ACLO WEST being present whilst I ask some questions.” 
          
         He said, “Yeh.” 
          
         I said, “Albert I wish to speak with you in relation to an armed holdup at the Commonwealth Bank Nanima Crescent about 10.45am today. You are not obliged to say or do anything as anything you say or do will betaken down and later used in evidence. Do you understand that?” 
          
         He said, “Yep.” 
          
         I said, “Do you wish to be interviewed in relation to this matter.” 
          
         He said, “No, No thanks.” 
          
         I said, “Do you wish to participate in a lineup.” 
          
         He said, “No.” 
         
        
       
      
      
    5   Section 115 of the Evidence Act 1995 deals with exclusion of evidence of identification by pictures. Subsection 115(1) provides:  
     
      
       
       115.(1) In this section: 
        
       ‘picture identification evidence’ means identification evidence relating to an identification made wholly or partly by the person who made the identification examining pictures kept for the use of police officers. 
       
      
    6   The picture identification evidence on which the Children’s Court acted falls within this definition. 
    7   Subsection 115(5) provides: 
     
      
       
       (5) Picture identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is not admissible if, when the pictures were examined, the defendant was in the custody of a police officer of the police force investigating the commission of the offence with which the defendant has been charged, unless: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) the defendant refused to take part in an identification parade; or 
        
       (b) the defendant’s appearance had changed significantly between the time when the offence was committed and the time when the defendant was taken into that custody; or 
        
       (c) it would not have been reasonable to have held an identification parade that included the defendant. 
       
      
    8   The picture identification evidence was not admissible, in the circumstances of this case, unless for the limited purpose of determining the objection to its admission in evidence there was a finding to the effect of para (a), that is, that the defendant (now the plaintiff) refused to take part in an identification parade. That finding must, of course, itself be based on admissible evidence, whether earlier admitted in evidence in the proceedings generally or admitted in evidence for the limited purpose of ruling on admissibility. In this case Mr Morley’s evidence to that effect had not been earlier admitted; it had been tendered, objected to and rejected. The terms of ruling show that the Magistrate had regard to Mr Morley’s evidence to the effect of the passage in his statement which I have set out; that evidence had been given on an earlier voir dire hearing. 
    9   The Magistrate did not in terms say that he admitted the material in evidence for the limited purpose of ruling on the objection, but his observations when ruling on submissions by Mr Dennis on behalf of the (now) plaintiff show that in substance he did that. The observations are these: 
     
      
       
       DENNIS: Well I say 424A covers it straight forward. 
       
      
      
       
       BENCH: I don’t think it is that straight forward Mr Dennis because what we are looking at here is exclusion of identification of pictures and the reason that the prosecution is seeking to adduce evidence by picture identification is because the defendant refused to take part in an identification parade. That is fact. The defendant did refuse to participate in a parade. Now as to whether that statement is admissible in terms of my consideration of section 115 seems to me to be reasonably simple. I have already indicated that I am satisfied that the breach under section 13 was either when applying the section 138(3) tests to it should be admitted because of the seriousness of the offence and I see no difference in applying the same test in terms of a combination of section 115 and section 424A. The reason for that is because we are at this stage considering evidence of exclusion of evidence of identification of pictures and I am prepared to accept the evidence of the officer that the reason picture identification was used was because the defendant refused to take part in an identification parade. That is a fact. 
       
      
      
       
       DENNIS: No you don’t have that before you. You don’t have that before you unless it is admissible. 
       
      
      
       
       BENCH: Well I say that it is admissible as part of the first voir dire that we have accepted as evidence in the second voir dire. It is acceptable in my consideration of section 115 and I find that the evidence is admissible, the photo identification evidence is admissible. 
       
      
    10   The earlier ruling was to the effect that evidence of Mr Morley was not admissible because of the operation of s 13 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) 1987 which is in these terms:  
     
      
       
       13 Admissibility of certain statements etc 
       
      
      
       
       (1) Any statement, confession, admission or information made or given to a member of the police force by a child who is a party to criminal proceedings shall not be admitted in evidence in those proceedings unless: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) there was present at the place where, and throughout the period of 
        
        time during which, it was made or given: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (i) a person responsible for the child, 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (ii) an adult (other than a member of the police force) who was present with the consent of the person responsible for the child, 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (iii) in the case of a child who is of or above the age of 16 years - an adult (other than a member of the police force) who was present with the consent of the child, or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (iv) a barrister or solicitor of the child’s own choosing, or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (b) the person acting judicially in those proceedings: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (i) is satisfied that there was proper and sufficient reason for the absence of such an adult from the place where, or throughout the period of time during which, the statement, confession, admission or information was made or given, and 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (ii) considers that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the statement, confession, admission or information should be admitted in evidence in those proceedings. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (2) In this section: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) a reference to a person acting judicially includes a reference to a 
        
       person making a determination as to the admissibility of evidence in 
        
       committal proceedings, and 
       
      
      
       
       (b) a reference to criminal proceedings is a reference to any criminal 
        
       proceedings in which a person is alleged to have committed an 
        
       offence while a child or which arise out of any other criminal 
        
       proceedings in which a person is alleged to have committed an 
        
       offence while a child. 
       
      
      
       
       (3) Nothing in this section limits or affects the admissibility in evidence in any criminal proceedings against a child of any statement or information that the child is required to make or give by virtue of the provisions of any Act or law. 
       
      
    11   When making the earlier ruling the Magistrate said to the effect that he was not satisfied that there was proper and sufficient reason for there not being present an adult who was not a member of the police service. At that point the Magistrate said in relation to Mr Morley’s evidence “I make no ruling on its eventual admissibility as to evidence relating to identification at a later time when s 13 may or may not be appropriate to consider.” Later when ruling on the objection to the picture identification evidence the Magistrate made the observations set out in para [9].  
    12   At first sight it might seem that if Mr Morley’s evidence was not admissible on the principal issues because of the operation of s 13 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and the absence of an adult, it was not admissible for the limited purpose of ruling on the admissibility of the picture identification evidence either, and for the same reason. However that contention was not made on behalf of the plaintiff in the appeal, and I was told that it was not made because it is now conceded that an adult who was present, Aboriginal Community Legal Officer West, was not in fact a member of the police force. 
    13   Before the Children’s Court reliance was also placed in support of the objection to the picture identification evidence on s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995, which relates to the discretion to exclude evidence which is improperly or illegally obtained. That was not relied on in the appeal. 
    14   The substantial matters argued in the appeal related to the operation of s 424A of the Crimes Act 1900. That section was inserted in the Crimes Act by the Evidence (Consequential And Other Provisions) Act 1995, a cognate enactment with the Evidence Act 1995. Section 424A provides:  
     
      
       
       424A.(1) This section applies in relation to evidence of an admission within the meaning of this section. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) Evidence of an admission is not admissible unless: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) there is available to the court a tape recording made by an investigating official of the interview in the course of which the admission was made, or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) if the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording referred to in paragraph (a) could not be made, there is available to the court a tape recording of an interview with the person who made the admission ;about the making and terms of the admission in the course of which the person states that he or she made an admission in those terms, or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (c) the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why the tape recordings referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) could not be made. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (3) The hearsay rule and the opinion rule (within the meaning of the Evidence Act 1995) do not prevent the admission or use of a tape recording as mentioned in subsection (2). 
       
      
      
       
       (4) In this section: 
       
      
      
       
       ‘admission’ means an admission: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) that was made by a defendant who, at the time when the admission was made, was, or ought reasonably to have been, suspected by an investigating official of having committed an offence, and 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) that was made in the course of official questioning, and 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (c) that relates to an indictable offence other than an indictable offence that may be dealt with summarily without the consent of the accused. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       ‘investigating official’ means: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) a police officer (other than a police officer who is engaged in covert investigations under the orders of a superior), or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) a person appointed by or under an Act (other than a person who is engaged in covert investigations under the orders of a superir) and whose functions include functions in respect of the prevention or investigation of offences, prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this definition. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       ‘official questioning’ means questioning by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence. 
       
      
      
       
       ‘reasonable excuse’ includes: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) a mechanical failure, or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) the refusal of a person being questioned to have the questioning electronically recorded, or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (c) the lack of availability of recording equipment within a period in which it would be reasonable to detain the person being questioned. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       ‘tape recording’ includes: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) audio recording, or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) video recording, or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (c) a video recording accompanied by a separately but contemporaneously recorded audio recording. 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       (5) This section does not apply to an admission made before the commencement of this section. 
       
      
    15   (Section 424A of the Crimes Act is no longer in force; substantially identical provision is now made by s 108 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which was inserted in that Act by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 1999 and took effect on 1 January 2000.) 
    16   So it was essential for the admissibility of picture identification evidence that there be a finding for the purpose of ruling on the objection that the now plaintiff refused to take part in an identification parade. That finding must have been based on the exchange recorded in Detective Morley’s statement as “I said ‘Do you wish to participate in a line-up?’ He said ‘No.’” which if itself admissible is a clear basis for finding that there was a refusal. If evidence of this exchange is evidence of an admission within the meaning of s 424A it was an error to admit it in evidence for the purposes of ruling on the objection, because none of the exceptions in paras (a), (b) and (c) of subs (2) applied in fact; there is no tape recording of the interview referred to in Mr Morley’s statement, no tape recording of a confirmatory interview and no evidence of a reasonable excuse as to why such tape recordings could not be made. 
    17   Submissions were made on the question whether there was a reasonable excuse within para (c) and subs 424A(2). In my view there was no evidence which raised the question of reasonable excuse for consideration; the plaintiff and Mr Morley were in an interview room at Wellington Police Station where there was electronic recording equipment and there is no evidence of circumstances of which explains why it was not used or why a further recording as contemplated by para (b) was not made. 
    18   Counsel for Mr Morley submitted that refusal to be interviewed at all, whether electronically or not, provided the interviewing officer with a reasonable excuse for not recording the refusal to participate in the line-up. This submission was supported by factual illustrations of the difficulties of conducting investigations which are produced if statements declining to be interviewed, and declining to participate in a line-up are themselves not admissible unless recorded. It may well be difficult or impossible to see that a statement is an admission when it is made; the question whether the statement is adverse to the maker’s interest is to be appraised at the time of the ruling on its admissibility. This blunts the significance of claims of efficiency of investigation. It is however clear that these provisions create practical difficulties for the conduct of investigations. Efficiency of investigation and prosecution were not primary considerations in the purposes of these enactments, which are protective legislation directed at limiting the occasions on which there may be judicial decisions based on relatively doubtful material about whether admissions relating to serious offences in truth were made; the legislation protects the administration of justice and the community generally and individually against convictions on uncertain bases, and also protects police officers against involvement in challenges to their credibility. 
    19   The definition of “admission” in subs (4) is a limiting definition and does not attempt to say what an admission is; it uses the word in a circular way so as to exclude some instances of what it would otherwise mean. The meaning of “admission” must be understood with the definitions in the Dictionary of the cognate Evidence Act 1995 - see Horton (1998) 104 A Crim R 306 at 313 per Wood CJ at CL for the view that the two pieces of legislation are cognate and that s 424A was enacted to provide additional requirements for admissibility of admissions cumulative to those applied by Pt 3.4.  
    20   It is necessary to take together the definitions of “admission”, “previous representation” and “representation” in the Dictionary of the Evidence Act: 
     
      
       
       admission 
        means a previous representation that is: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding (including a defendant in a criminal proceeding); and 
       
      
      
       
       (b) adverse to the person’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding. 
       
      
      
       
       previous representation 
        means a representation made otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in the proceeding in which evidence of the representation is sought to be adduced. 
       
      
      
       
       representation 
        includes: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) an express or implied representation (whether oral or in writing); or 
       
      
      
       
       (b) a representation to the inferred from conduct; or 
       
      
      
       
       (c) a representation not intended by its maker to be communicated to or seen by another person; or 
       
      
      
       
       (d) a representation that for any reason is not communicated. 
        
       
      
    21   The concept of a previous representation is introduced in Pt 3.2 of the Evidence Act by the statement in s 59 of the hearsay rule: 
     
      
       
       59.(1) Evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that the person intended to assert by the representation. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) Such a fact is in this Part referred to as an asserted fact. 
       
      
    22   This teaches us that a representation is or can be something which is intended to assert the existence of a fact. 
    23   Section 72 creates an exception.  
     
      
       
       72. The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a representation made by a person that was a contemporaneous representation about the person’s health, feelings, sensations, intention, knowledge or state of mind. 
       
      
    24   A number of sections state other exceptions, also by reference of the word “representation”. Section 81 creates an exception to the hearsay rule in respect of admissions in these terms:  
     
      
       
       81.(1) The hearsay rule and the opinion rule do not apply to evidence of an admission. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) The hearsay rule and the opinion rule do not apply to evidence of a previous representation: 
       
      
      
       
        (a) that was made in relation to an admission at the time the 
        
        admission was made, or shortly before or after that time; and 
       
      
      
       
        (b) to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to 
        
         
         understand the admission. 
         
        
       
      
    25   Section 82 provides: 
     
      
       
       82. Section 81 does not prevent the application of the hearsay rule to evidence of an admission unless: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (a) it is given orally by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the admission being made; or 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         (b) it is a document in which the admission is made. 
         
        
       
      
      
    26   Sections 85 and 86 make special provisions relating to admissibility in evidence of admissions made by a defendant in criminal proceedings. Section 424A supplements ss 85 and 86 by imposing additional conditions for reception in evidence where the admission is made to an investigating official in the course of official questioning, and then only in the case of certain indictable offences. The appearance of this provision in the Crimes Act and now in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 may be attributable to avoiding disturbance of textual uniformity with the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). 
    27   The definition of “representation” in the Dictionary is a definition of inclusion; it is circular in its use of “representation”, and it is not purportedly exhaustive. The questions of difficulty begin with whether the plaintiff’s statement “No” in the context of the question to which it responded was a representation; if it was, it was a previous representation as defined, and within the inclusions of paras (a) and (b) of the definition of “representation”. This leads on to the further difficulty of the implications for the construction and application of s 424A which should be understood to flow from the cognate character of the two enactments: the difficulty of the extent to which the meaning of “admission” in s 424A is established and controlled by reasoning on the terms of the cognate Evidence Act. 
    28   The statement “No” in its context does not fall within any meaning of the word “admission” in ordinary usage, or in any usage known to me in evidence law or other law. If “admission” in s 424A is to be understood in the context of s 424A itself, in my opinion the statement was not an admission; it was a direct statement on the subject of the plaintiff’s wishes about taking part in an identification parade, and was not in any sense an admission or (to search for illustrative analogies) a narration, a relation or a representation about whether some state of facts existed. Nothing in the definition of “admission” set out in s424A could lead to any qualification of this opinion. The statement is an admission within the meaning of that word in s 424A only if s 424A is in this respect controlled by applying the definitions in the Dictionary in the Evidence Act 1995, and if the meaning of “admission” is established by tracing through the chain of definitions to the word “representation”, and establishing the meaning of “representation” by considerations based on the way in which that word is used in the Evidence Act. The meaning of “representation” is not in my view relevantly assisted by the inclusions in the definition of “representation” in the Dictionary.  
    29   The word “representation” in ordinary usage is in my understanding capable of several shades of meaning; it can refer to a narration of some fact, case or argument, to an assertion that some state of fact is correct, and it can also refer to the depiction, it may be in words, of something which stands in the place of but is known not to be the original state of fact. I see no reason to think that the legislature intended by defining “admission” in the Dictionary by reference to “representation” to depart wholly from what, in the previous law of evidence, was understood to be an admission and was received in evidence as such. 
    30   Counsel for the plaintiff referred me to passages in the Law Reform Commission’s Interim Report No 26, but not to any passage which comments on or tends to explain choice of the word “representation” as an integer in the definition of the word “admission”. At para 755 reference was made to uncertainty as to the precise definition of an admission - “Definition. Existing uncertainty as to the precise definition of an admission has been noted - whether it should be defined simply as evidence of a party’s assertion adduced by an opponent, or evidence of an assertion that is against the party’s interest at trial.” I gain no assistance from the passages in the interim report to which I was referred for an understanding why “admission” should be taken to have been defined by reference to the word “representation”.  
    31   Counsel offered the analysis that the plaintiff in stating “No” in answer to the question was admitting or representing the state of his mind on the subject with which the question dealt. To my mind this is a highly artificial analysis of the process which was taking place, and it does not accord with the basis in which in the general law of evidence statements about a person’s state of mind or feelings were admitted; they were admitted in evidence as original evidence of the state of mind or feelings, and not as admissions about what they are. For that reason they were admitted generally, and not only against those making the statements. In the Evidence Act the reception into evidence of a contemporaneous representation about a person’s intentions, state of mind and related matters is dealt with expressly in s 72, and is there spoken of as a representation. 
    32   In the sense in which “representation” is used in s 72 of the Evidence Act, a statement about a person’s contemporaneous state of mind is a representation. It is for consideration whether this use established the meaning of “representation” which the Dictionary incorporates in “admission” as defined and whether the result of so doing establishes the meaning of s 424A. Where the Evidence Act deals with admissions in general language which could literally extend to reception in evidence of statements about a state of mind there is no exception such as s 72 makes for the general operation of the hearsay rule to representations. Nor is there any such exception in relation to s 424A of the Crimes Act. 
    33   The effect of the contentions on behalf of the plaintiff is that as used in the Evidence Act a representation includes a statement about a person’s contemporaneous intentions or state of mind, including the person’s wish or will, such as that attributed to the plaintiff in Mr Morley’s evidence, that the Dictionary includes this reach of “representation” in the meaning of “admission” in the Dictionary, and that this result holds for the word “admission” in s 424A. 
    34   I find this reading and conclusion highly artificial; according to ordinary concepts and usage, “admission” would not extend to such a statement. However the argument finds apparent support in the language of the Dictionary and in the application, which has been authoritatively accepted, of meanings in the Dictionary to s 424A. 
    35   On behalf of the plaintiff counsel submitted that the fact that the prosecution did not rely on the representation for a hearsay purpose does not mean that it falls outside the definition. In support of this submission counsel referred to Hinton (1999) 103 A Crim R 142; I do not find support for the proposition in that decision. Hinton does illustrate that a previous representation may, within the Dictionary definition of “admission”, be adverse to the person’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding in other ways than by confessing the crime charged or a fact which is an element in it, and also illustrates that a statement intended to be exculpatory may be adverse to the person’s interest. That that is so is also shown by Esposito (1998) 105 A Crim R 27 at 43-44 (Wood CJ at CL). 
    36   The exchange of questions and answers under objection could not fall within the ordinary and natural meaning of “admission”. In my opinion it does not fall within the meaning of “admission” as used in s 424A if that section is understood on its own, or as it is set in the context of other references in the Crimes Act 1900 to admissions, and the possibility that it does fall within that meaning only comes under consideration by a chain of reasoning which leads through the cognate character of the Evidence Act 1995 with the legislation which introduced s 424A into the Crimes Act, and through the definitions in the Dictionary of the Evidence Act of “previous representation” and “representation”, to uses in the Evidence Act of “representation” including use of “representation” in s 72 in a way which shows that the word was used in that section, and (it could be supposed) should be taken to have been used elsewhere in the Evidence Act 1995 (including the Dictionary) in a way which can refer to a statement expressing a person’s intention or state of mind.  
    37   To my mind the use of the word “representation” in s 72 (and I have not observed any parallel use elsewhere in the Evidence Act) is highly artificial. The plaintiff’s counsel put to me the interpretation of what took place that the plaintiff by saying the word “No” was making a representation about his state of mind at the time. This in my view is a highly artificial perception of what a representation is, and of what occurs when a person expresses a consent, a refusal or another state of mind. In my view what takes place is a consent or a refusal; the consent or refusal is an event itself, or it could be called a fact of itself, and it is only in an obscuringly indirect way that it could be perceived as a representation about a state of mind, or that it could be supposed that the word “representation” was used in the Dictionary in a sense which included it. The word sets up a generalised frame of reference, and is not highly indicative, and in considering its application to a concrete situation it seems important to have regard to the purposes for which the provision in which it is used was enacted. 
    38   The meaning of “admission” in s 424A was considered extensively in the judgment of Wood CJ at CL with the concurrence of Sully and Ireland JJ in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Horton (1998) 108 A Crim R 306. The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal is not strictly binding on a judge hearing an appeal under Pt 5 of the Justices Act 1902 because further appeal lies to the Court of Appeal and not the Court of Criminal Appeal: see Supreme Court Act 1970 s 101(1)(h). “The essential basis for the observance of a decision by a tribunal by way of binding precedent is that that tribunal can correct the decisions of the court which is said so to be bound” per Barwick CJ in Viro v. The Queen (1978) 141 CLR 88 at 93. See too Gibbs J at 120. However Horton is of considerable authority, and it is persuasive in its reasoning. Section 424A was held to extend to a statement which was literally exculpatory but was relevant in a way adverse to the interests of the accused in that the fact that she had been able to furnish an exculpatory statement was relevant to her degree of intoxication and to the formation of intent. In relation to what the statement tended to prove if admitted in evidence, the statement had none of the character of a consent, a refusal or in any other way of a contemporaneous representation about the accused’s intention or state of mind.  
    39   The judgment of Wood CJ at CL shows, at 313, that it is correct to look to the Evidence Act for the meaning of the expression “admission” in s 424A. Wood CJ at CL did not apply the incorporated Dictionary definitions in a highly literal or mechanistic way; his Honour directed detailed attention to the concept of an admission, and did not act on the basis that the word “representation” is wholly substituted by the chain of reference. The judgment did not examine or expound the meaning of “representation”, or any question relating to the reach of “admission” in s 424A(2) to evidence of a refusal or consent. His Honour’s judgment does show that although the Dictionary definition of “admission” is purportedly an exhaustive definition by reference to the further term “representation” there has not been an entire departure from the concept of an admission according to ordinary usage and other statutory usage. At least in concept words of refusal might in some circumstances be relevant to the proof of the offence; as the facts in Horton show, circumstances may make a statement relevant to the proof of an offence, although on its face it is exculpatory or has no bearing on the offence. There are no such circumstances here, and it could not be said that, even in the most indirect way, the refusal was relevant to the question whether or not the plaintiff was the offender. An example given in Horton at 318 is a statement put in evidence as weakening the accused’s credibility. The passage under objection in this case could not be so used. 
    40   At 317-318 Wood CJ at CL examined the mischief to which s 424A was addressed and the Second Reading Speech to the Legislative Council in support of it. The passage in that speech which most closely bears on the purpose of the enactment of s 424A is as follows: 
     
      
       
       The Police Service has already introduced a system for the electronic recording of interviews, implementing the 1986 report for the criminal law review division of the Attorney-General’s Department. That report set out four objectives for adopting and electronic system: 
        
         
         1. To provide the Courts with a reliable account of statements made by persons accused of crime whilst in police custody. 
          
         2. To provide an objective means of resolving disputes about the conduct and substance of police interviews. 
          
         3. To deter and/or prevent the use of unfair practices by the police prior to, during and after interviews. 
          
         4. To deter the making of unfair and false allegations of improper behaviour by police 
         
        
       This Bill implements one of the recommendations of that report by providing that any unreasonable failure to adhere to the system will result in the admissibility of the evidence. The courts are thereby enabled to supervise the operation of the system. 
       
      
    41   The word used is “admission” and a clear expression of legislative intention would be required if it were to be established that the word was used to refer to or to include something quite different to its ordinary meaning. Statutory definitions can be quite artificial, but there is usually good reason for choosing the defined word. “It is often the case that the most important aspect of a statutory definition is the word being defined” - per Spigelman CJ in Repatriation Commission v. Vietnam Veterans’ Association [2000] NSWCA 65 at para [104]. If an artificial meaning is given to a word by legislation, I would think that its full force will not necessarily be carried through to the use of the word in cognate legislation, the terms and purposes of which are also important. 
    42   At the heart of submissions by plaintiff’s counsel was the clearly expressed contention that “admission” includes a representation which is adverse to the interests of the plaintiff in the sense that it is put in evidence to support the admission of other adverse evidence, and that the plaintiff’s word “No” is a representation. The contention was that the policy behind the legislation is to ensure the reliability of any statement made by a suspect that is sought to be used against him in criminal proceedings, and that this appears from the four objectives listed in the Second Reading Speech, particularly from the first. 
    43   Counsel for Mr Morley submitted that “admissions” only includes representations which are adverse to the person making them. Counsel contended that it is significant that it could not be seen by the interviewing officer at the time of the conversation relating to refusal to participate in a line-up whether the refusal was adverse to the interests of the plaintiff; that would depend on the outcome of the line-up and if there was no line-up that could not be known at any time. 
    44   My view is that the frame of reference in which s 424A was enacted was unsatisfactory experience relating to proof of admissions made in police interviews. When a purposive construction is given to the word “admission” in s 424A, taken with the indeterminate penumbrum of meaning of “representation” incorporated by several stages of reference, I am of the view that it does not extend to the evidence under objection in relation to the proof of whether or not the defendant refused to take part in an identification parade within s 115(4)(a). What is required to be proved is that the defendant refused to take part in an identification parade. The proof offered was direct proof of the event of the defendant saying something which in context was a refusal, and there was no proof of an admission. Conceivably a different kind of proof might be offered: a later statement admitting that there had been a refusal would have to pass the tests for admissibility under s424A. The prosecution case did not include any such step. In my opinion s424A, when understood by reference to its own language, its statutory context and the purposes for which it was enacted, was not intended to apply to proof of the first kind: or (to restate that opinion) was not intended to use “admission” in a sense which applied to proof of the first kind. 
    45   It appeared to me that it was open to consideration whether the relation between the terms of the refusal and the proof of the offence was sufficiently direct for it to be concluded that the admission related to the alleged offence within para (c) of the definition of “admission” in s424A. Counsel for the second defendant did not rely on any such question and I leave it unexamined.  
    46   Counsel for the second defendant contended that subs 85(2) of the Evidence Act demonstrates that admissions are something the truth of which is relevant. It was submitted that a statement the truth of which is not relevant is not an admission. I have not based my opinion on subs.85(2). 
    47   On behalf of Mr Morley counsel submitted that if it were accepted that the plaintiff’s answer was an admission (and his submissions did not accept that) the answer was not a previous representation which was “adverse to the person’s interest in the outcome of the proceedings” in terms of para (b) of the Dictionary definition of “admission”. It was contended that it could only be said that a refusal to participate in a line-up was adverse to the person’s interest if it were known whether or not he would be identified in a line-up. I do not accept this submission; the time at which the question whether the representation is adverse to the person’s interest in the outcome of the proceedings is to be tested is the time at which it is tendered in evidence, and it is clear that at that time it was adverse to the (now) plaintiff’s interest in the outcome because it supported the reception of picture identification evidence. 
    48   In my opinion the evidence objected to was admissible for the purpose for which it was relied on. The appeal should be dismissed. 
    49   Order: The appeal is dismissed.

      70041/99 - REGINA -v- WILLIAM ROY DARGIN 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: The offender, William Roy Dargin, was indicted before me on a charge that he, on 30 September 1998, did murder Estelle Winifred Featherstone. To that charge he pleaded guilty and was convicted. Accordingly, he is for sentence today. 
     
      
    2    The offender asks that in passing sentence I take into account an offence of aggravated sexual assault of the victim committed by him contemporaneously with the homicide. The Crown Prosecutor consents to this course which I propose to follow, a Form 1 having been completed. 
     
      
    3    In order to determine the sentence to be imposed, it is my duty to find the facts which gave rise to the offence. In doing so, the relevant standard of proof is the criminal standard, being proof beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    4    I am satisfied to the relevant degree that Estelle Winifred Featherstone (""the victim"") died on the evening of 30 September 1998 as a result of multiple head and neck injuries inflicted upon her by William Roy Dargin, to whom I shall refer as ""the offender"". 
     
      
    5    The autopsy report of Professor John Hilton, which forms part of Exhibit B, discloses that the victim sustained multiple, gross comminuted fractures to both the lower and upper jaw, the latter involving the sinuses. 
     
      
    6    The neck injuries included bilateral fractures of the hyoid bone and damage to the thyroid cartilage suggestive of attempted strangulation. Professor Hilton further described the injury to the genital area comprised of a superficial tear of the fourchette and considerable bruising around the posterior aspect of the urethra extending slightly into the lateral walls. 
     
      
    7    The means by which the grave and fatal injuries were inflicted have remained undisclosed, however the offender is a strong and fit, albeit obese, young man who was observed by a local medical practitioner, Dr West, to be exhibiting bruising to the knuckles and fingers of his right hand on the day following the homicide. 
     
      
    8    It is common ground that the fatal injuries were inflicted by blows to the face and head of the victim with the offender's fists. 
     
      
    9    The facts surrounding the murder of the victim are clear from the extensive evidentiary material contained in the comprehensive folder, Exhibit B. It is common ground that the Crown case is very strong and that the facts, insofar as they are disclosed in Exhibit B, are not disputed. They may be summarised as follows. 
     
      
    10    The victim, a 72 year old married woman, resided with her husband, Douglas Featherstone, at 18 McDonnell Street, Condobolin. This residence is separated from the Condobolin RSL Club by a narrow laneway. 
     
      
    11    On 30 September 1998, Mr Featherstone travelled in the motorcar of a friend to Orange for medical treatment. He left home about 8.00am and returned that evening between 7.15pm and 7.20pm. He observed no lights to be on in the house, but could hear the television set operating and assumed his wife to be watching it. His calls to her were unanswered. 
     
      
    12    The premises had been modified in a rear extension to accommodate wheelchair access to cater for Mr Featherstone's partial immobility. He did not go to the front of the house but retired to bed. 
     
      
    13    He awoke at about 9.30pm and made his way to the front of the house where he found the front door open and the television still turned on. Mr Featherstone turned off the television set and telephoned the RSL Club, where he assumed his wife would be, requesting that a message be given to his wife to come home. He returned to bed but awoke again at 11.00pm when he undertook a search of the house discovering the body of his wife in a front bedroom. He called the police and family members. 
     
      
    14    Earlier that day, the victim had withdrawn $200 from a bank account. $93.95 of this was used to pay the family electricity account. She also had some winnings from the RSL poker machines. She was last seen by persons, other than the offender, at about 4.45pm to 5.00pm on Wednesday, 30 September at the RSL Club next door. 
     
      
    15    The offender arrived in Condobolin from Parkes on Tuesday, 29 September 1998. He stayed with a relative in a flat at the rear of the Renown Theatre. The material tendered establishes that he was out of money by 5.00pm on 30 September, when he unsuccessfully attempted to borrow $10 from the licensee of the Imperial Hotel. 
     
      
    16    I am satisfied on the evidence tendered that the murder to which the offender has pleaded guilty resulted from injuries inflicted by him upon the victim in the period between about 5.00pm and 5.30pm, the former being a time when the offender was seen in a laneway beside the residence, 18 McDonnell Street, and the latter being a time when he was observed to walk from that location to the flat behind the Renown Theatre. 
     
      
    17    I find that shortly after 5.30pm the offender invited others to drink with him and purchased a significant quantity of alcohol with the money from the victim's purse which he stole from her home. 
     
      
    18    Later in the evening of 30 September, the offender spoke to two acquaintances with whom he and others were drinking and said words to the effect that he had to disclose something to get it off his mind, the disclosures being that he had bashed an old lady for $150, that he thought he had killed her and that he had seen blood coming out of her nose and mouth. He said words to this effect on a number of occasions. 
     
      
    19    Upon execution of a search warrant of the flat where the offender was staying, a purse identified as belonging to the victim was found. The offender's shirt worn by him on the prior evening was located in the flat the next day by a fellow occupant in a bloodstained condition and was handed to police. The bloodstaining on the shirt was established by DNA testing to have originated from the victim. 
     
      
    20    DNA testing of blood stains on other clothing of the offender and from within the home of the victim was established as originating from more than one individual and, if from two persons, was 1.7 billion, billion times more likely to have originated from the offender and the victim than from two other persons each selected at random from the general population. 
     
      
    21    Accordingly, I am satisfied, on the relevant standard, that the offender entered the home of the victim with the intention of stealing money from the premises or of robbing the victim, that whilst in the premises the offender delivered a series of heavy blows to the head and face of the victim and applied force and pressure to her neck causing the multiple fractures to the face, upper and lower jaws and the hyoid bone in her neck, more fully described in the autopsy report, and which resulted in her death which probably occurred between 8.00pm and 8.30pm that same evening. 
     
      
    22    I find further that whilst in the premises the offender sexually assaulted the victim by causing her vagina to be penetrated by an object or objects unknown causing the injuries to her genital area as previously described. 
     
      
    23    The offender is a 24 year old Aboriginal man who was born on 7 April 1976 in Sydney. His single mother was aged 16 at the time of his birth. He was initially brought up by his grandfather and later by his great aunt in Queensland. He ran away from this environment when aged 10 or 11 and lived with an aunt at Mt Druitt who adopted him. He met his mother at the age of about 12 or 13 and lived with her and her defacto husband for some time. 
     
      
    24    The family moved to Condobolin for some time and later returned to Sydney. He has two half brothers and three half sisters. He seems to have a strong bond with his mother whom he contacts daily. 
     
      
    25    The offender has had a grossly interrupted education at a number of primary schools where he exhibited behavioural problems, eventually leaving school at age 15 during Year 9. 
     
      
    26    The offender commenced drinking alcohol when truanting from school, the habit developing to regular drinking once he left school. 
     
      
    27    His youth is described as having been spent in and out of boys' homes, including Minda, Cobham and finally Mt Penang, where he spent nine months following a conviction on a charge of robbery in company. 
     
      
    28    The offender's criminal history is a sad chronicle of criminal activity with numerous entries of offences principally involving dishonesty, but also with episodes of violence extending over eight years to 1998. 
     
      
    29    In her report of 7 October 1999, Ms Anita Duffy, a psychologist, disclosed that the offender admitted to periods of depression during his lifetime and that he tried to overdose on his aunt's heart medication some two years ago. He recounted having always had a bad temper where he became easily aggravated and agitated and, in his words, his ""brain explodes"". These episodes of ill-temper were exacerbated by drinking alcohol, at which times the offender said he more easily engaged in fights. 
     
      
    30    Ms Duffy administered a number of basic screening tests to assess the offender's personality and cognitive ability. These were said to show a ""slight tendency towards, but do not strongly indicate the presence of brain impairment due to prolonged drinking"". 
     
      
    31    In her report of 18 November 1999, Ms Julie Hendy, a clinical and consulting neuropsychologist, considered the question as to whether the offender's alcohol abuse had given rise to some brain damage. She expressed the opinion that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The results of the neuropsychological assessment would indicate that Mr Dargin is a man of below average intelligence but with relative strength in the non-verbal and spatial domain and relevant weaknesses in his language skills."" 
        
       
      
    32    She went on to express the opinion that the offender's scores on the tests conducted by her were not a reflection of acquired brain impairment. 
     
      
    33    The objective seriousness of the crime of murder places it at the head of the criminal calendar. The deliberate taking of the life of another is a crime of the utmost gravity, abhorrent to our community. It attracts a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. In this State, life imprisonment, since the enactment of the Sentencing Act, 1989, has meant imprisonment for the term of the offender's natural life. Such a sentence is, necessarily, reserved for the worst class of case. 
     
      
    34    In the present case, the offender acknowledges his guilt on the Form 1, under s 161 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1986, to an offence of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation pursuant to s 61J of the Crimes Act, 1900, which itself carries a maximum penalty of 20 years penal servitude. 
     
      
    35    In his comprehensive and helpful written submissions on sentence, Mr Wilson of counsel for the offender, has referred to Regina v Dodd (1991) 57 ACrimR 349 and, in particular, the passage at 354, where the Court of Criminal Appeal adopted the approach of Chief Justice Jordan in Regina v Geddes (1936) 36 SR(NSW) 554 at 556, where the learned Chief Justice emphasises the importance of seeking to determine a sentence appropriate to a particular crime having regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively as the foundational premise and the importance of the objective facts and the subjective features of a particular case, not overlooking the risks and attention to persuasive subjective considerations which may cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    36    The aggravating features of the present case include the fact that this was a brutal attack upon an elderly, defenceless woman within the sanctity of her own home. The motivation was a paltry monetary reward which was intended to be used, and was used, for the gratification of a desire for alcohol. There is the further gross aggravation of the sexual offence and the injuries which the victim sustained in this regard. 
     
      
    37    A further aggravating feature of the offender's conduct is that this offence was committed whilst he was on bail with regard to other offences committed by him of which he was duly convicted. 
     
      
    38    Whilst, in the opinion of Professor Hilton, the fractures to the hyoid bone and the damage to the thyroid cartilage were suggestive of attempted strangulation, it is submitted by counsel on behalf of the offender that I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, on the available evidence, that these injuries were not incidental to the assault upon the victim generally, in that they were consistent with the holding down by the throat of the victim. There is force in this submission and, accordingly, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender attempted to strangle the victim. However, the inference which follows and which seems to me to be the only reasonable inference open, is that the holding down of the victim in the manner contended for was, and the resultant neck injuries were, part of the sexual assault being perpetrated by the offender at a time when the victim was aware of what was being done to her. 
     
      
    39    The further submission is made on behalf of the offender that the established facts do not make out beyond reasonable doubt the intent to kill the victim and that sentence should be passed on the basis that the central element of intent was the intent to do grievous bodily harm. Reliance is placed on Regina v Isaacs (1997) 90 ACrimR 587 at 592. Support for this submission is sought from the fact that the offender was uncertain as to whether the victim was dead and later that evening sought confirmation from police and an ambulance officer at the crime scene. 
     
      
    40    Counsel for the Crown submits in this regard that the offences took place in daylight hours and that the identity of the offender could well have been established by the victim had she survived, hence the intention manifest in the assault upon her was to kill the victim with a view, at least, to conceal the intended robbery. There is substance also in this submission, however, my view as to the events which took place inside the victim's home at the time of the homicide and immediately prior thereto and the established circumstances, do not permit of a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the offender's intent was to kill the victim. Accordingly, I proceed to sentence on the basis that his intention was to cause to her grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    41    I am satisfied further that the murder was unplanned and that throughout the day the offender had consumed alcohol with friends and some relatives. His degree of intoxication at the time of the offences is not altogether clear. Ms Jamison, an experienced bar worker, saw a person answering the description of the offender at about 5.20pm or so, in the lane by the Featherstones' house, who appeared to be walking in an intoxicated manner. An hour later in the hotel she saw the offender who did not appear so badly affected. He was observed to be well affected at about 9.10pm by another observer who knew him. 
     
      
    42    Mr Wilson submits that the offender's intoxication should be considered as a mitigating, rather than an aggravating, feature. Reliance is placed upon Regina v Coleman (1990) 47 ACrimR 306, a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. In that case, the appellant was convicted of maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse with that male person. He raised the matter of his long term intoxication during the trial. Hunt J, as the former Chief Judge at Common Law then was, with whom Finlay and Allen JJ agreed, at p 327 said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Only one matter of general principle was debated, and that was the extent to which the appellant was entitled to have his intoxication at the time of his offence taken into account in mitigation. The degree of deliberation shown by an offender is usually a matter to be taken into account; such intoxication would therefore be relevant in determining the degree of deliberation involved in the offender's breach of the law. In some circumstances, it may aggravate the crime because of the recklessness with which the offender became intoxicated; in other circumstances, it may mitigate the crime because the offender has by reason of that intoxication acted out of character. (I have not intended by those examples to limit the extent to which intoxication may be taken into account: see, generally,  
        Sewell and Walsh 
         (1981) 29 SASR 12 at 14-15; 5 ACrimR 204 at 207.) Where the reason for the offender's intoxication is a self-administered drug rather than alcohol, the cases suggest that that fact may well be more likely to aggravate than to mitigate. 
        
       
       
        
        But that is not this case. The only evidence is that the appellant had been an alcoholic over a long period of time. At the same time, however, it is clear from the appellant's record and from the medical evidence led that the violence which he exhibited on this occasion was sadly not out of character. In all of those circumstances, in reassessing the appropriate sentence to be imposed I would not place much weight upon the appellant's intoxication in mitigation, but I would not take  
        [it] 
         into account in aggravation."" 
        
       
      
    43    In Regina v Fernando (1992) 76 ACrimR 58, Wood J, as the Chief Judge of the Common Law Division then was, in what is generally considered to be a definitive judgment, commencing at p 62, said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(E) While drunkenness is not normally an excuse or mitigating factor, where the abuse of alcohol by the person standing for sentence reflects the socio-economic circumstances and environment in which the offender has grown up, that can and should be taken into account as a mitigating factor. This involves the realistic recognition by the court of the endemic presence of alcohol within Aboriginal communities, and the grave social difficulties faced by those communities where poor self-image, absence of education and work opportunity and other demoralising factors have placed heavy stresses on them, reinforcing their resort to alcohol and compounding its worst effects. 
        
       
       
        
        (F) That in sentencing persons of Aboriginal descent the court must avoid any hint of racism, paternalism or collective guilt yet must nevertheless assess realistically the objective seriousness of the crime within its local setting and by reference to the particular subjective circumstances of the offender."" 
        
       
      
    44    The offender's long criminal history is conceded by him in his interview with the psychologist, Ms Anita Duffy, to be one in which intoxication frequently has led to criminal behaviour at times involving violence, albeit not anything like the degree here present, but violent, lawless conduct nonetheless. 
     
      
    45    The offender's claims to have no recall of the events, during the critical time when the offences took place, are wholly inconsistent with his confessional statements to the two persons with whom he was drinking after the offences had been committed, because of the need he felt to get the matter off his mind. 
     
      
    46    Mindful of the principles above referred to, I conclude that in the present case the offender's intoxication is not a matter to which a great deal of weight can be given either in aggravation or in mitigation of sentence. 
     
      
    47    The offender's plea of guilty came at a very late stage. It was entered in the presence of the jury panel when the trial was about to commence and the victim's husband, other family members and other witnesses had already faced the emotional trauma associated with the prospect of giving evidence for a long period of time. 
     
      
    48    Nevertheless, the utilitarian considerations of avoiding a trial stand to his credit and, whilst to some degree an element of contrition is inherent in a guilty plea, there is no evidence of any expression of remorse by the offender to any person at any time. 
     
      
    49    The guilty plea must also be considered in the light of a strong Crown case in which a conviction would appear to have been inevitable. 
     
      
    50    I have had the benefit of considering a schedule of prior decisions prepared by Mr Wilson as offering assistance in identifying an appropriate range of sentence. These cases cited include, in particular, Regina v Bossie (NSWSC, Studdert J, 16 April 1992, unreported), Regina v Broughton (NSWSC, Smart J, 30 May 1994, unreported), Regina v Duke (NSWSC, McInerney J, 15 September 1994, unreported), Regina v Lorenzo (NSWCCA, 22 May 1995, unreported), Regina v Previtera (1997) 94 ACrimR 76, Regina v Sharpe (NSWSC, Wood J, 9 September 1992, unreported), Regina v Sullivan (NSWSC, Simpson J, 14 July 1994, unreported) and Regina v Veitch (NSWSC, Hunt J, 19 March 1991, unreported). 
     
      
    51    In citing these authorities, counsel recognises that it is inappropriate to compare the sentence imposed on one offender with that imposed on another offender who is not a co-offender simply because any two offenders may have similar characteristics and may have committed similar crimes. What must be looked at is the objective gravity of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the particular offender which will inevitably give rise to different circumstances: Regina v Morgan (1993) 70 ACrimR 368. 
     
      
    52    I have considered the cases to which reference has been made. 
     
      
    53    In determining the sentence to be imposed, I have taken into account the Form 1 matter. 
     
      
    54    The general principles of sentencing require consideration of specific and general deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation and protection of the community. 
     
      
    55    It is common ground that the offender's intellectual functioning does not operate at a level where general deterrence would assume significantly lower prominence: Regina v Champion (1992) 64 ACrimR 244. 
     
      
    56    The offender has been serving his sentence in strict protection, apparently resulting from a threat made against him. He has recently been transferred to Parklea Correctional Centre in strict protection for this reason. It is recognised that an offender serving a sentence in strict protection does so under more onerous conditions than those in the general prison population. 
     
      
    57    The need for a lengthy period in custody for a serious criminal offence, such as the present, carries with it, under the ordinary statutory ratio provided for by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999, a substantial period of parole. 
     
      
    58    Nevertheless, in the present case there are special circumstances which are constituted by the youth of the offender, the fact that he will serve his sentence on protection, his background and the risk of institutionalisation requiring a longer period of rehabilitation and supervision upon release which warrant some, albeit small, variation in the statutory provisions. 
     
      
    59    The offender was taken into custody on 1 October 1998. He has remained in custody since that date. However, a period of six months has been served in relation to matters unrelated to the present offences. 
     
      
    60    It is common ground that his sentence for the present offences is to commence on 1 April 1999. 
     
      
    61    William Roy Dargin, for the murder of Estelle Winifred Featherstone, you are sentenced to 19 years imprisonment which commenced on 1 April 1999 and will conclude on 31 March 2018. There will be a non-parole period of 14 years which will expire on 31 March 2013. 
     
      
    62    The date on which you will first become eligible for release on parole is accordingly 1 April 2013.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JThursday, 6 July 200070054/99 - REGINA v Maria Giulia SETTESENTENCE1   HIS HONOUR: The offender, Maria Giulia Sette, has been convicted of the manslaughter on or about 8 February 1999 at Moama of James Dean Sette, also known as James Jasper Strahan. The offender gave birth to the deceased, James Dean Sette, on 7 November 1997. The child was made available for adoption. In due course adoptive parents were chosen and the child was placed in their care. The adoption regime incorporated a period of time during which the offender was entitled to have access to the child. On Sunday, 7 February 1999 the offender attended a picnic which had been arranged at Daylesford Lakes, Victoria, so that she could have access. Ms Strahan and Mr Gilding, the adoptive parents, attended with the child. The offender removed the child on a pretext, put him in her car and drove away. She stabbed the child to death and concealed his body in a dam near Moama, New South Wales. 
     
      
    2   Put in that way, the facts of the matter seem brutal indeed, but there is much more to say. In order to gain some understanding why the offender acted as she did it is necessary to pay some regard to the details of her personal life and to the circumstances in which she bore the child and permitted it to be made available for adoption. The offender was born on 8 October 1967, the eldest daughter of an Italian family resident in suburban Melbourne. Her father and mother were hard-working people who had strict, traditional, moral views. There were four children of the marriage. The eldest was a son, who was three years older than the offender. The offender was the eldest daughter and the other two daughters were respectively three years and eleven years her juniors. As was traditional in such a family, precedence was accorded to the son. The offender, as the eldest daughter, was expected to take an interest in domestic matters and to assist her mother with the younger children as she grew older. 
     
      
    3   The offender is a woman of average intelligence. She appears to have negotiated primary school successfully but not to have had a fulfilling time in high school. She struggled and had few friends. As she grew up she was sensitive and shy. When confronted with fights or disagreements she usually lost. She would retreat to her room in silence, sometimes for days. Her siblings found it easy to put the blame on her when it suited them. 
     
      
    4   She left school at seventeen and completed a dressmaking and design course, after which she worked for several years in clothing shops and boutiques. She was not happy, however, and frequently came home upset at the end of the day. During her adolescence she had become intensely sensitive about what she regarded as the size of her nose and at the age of nineteen she underwent plastic surgery to alter its size and shape. During all this time she continued to live in the family home, as was expected of her. 
     
      
    5   Apparently in an attempt to break out of her environment, she began associating in her early twenties with a group of people who attended night clubs. They took illegal drugs as well as alcohol and so did she. She retired badly hurt from that milieu after she was raped. The matter was never officially reported, and her experience compounded her shyness, inability to compete and distrust of men. Such relationships with men as she had were short and unsatisfactory. 
     
      
    6   She and the sister closer to her in age were made the joint managers of a family-owned newsagency, but they did not work well together and arrangements had to be changed. This did nothing for her confidence or state of mind. 
     
      
    7   She began to consult a general practitioner frequently for a variety of complaints that suggested that all was not well with her. She complained of persistent insomnia. In 1996 she was referred to a psychiatrist, Dr Leitmanis. No specific psychiatric disorder was diagnosed. 
     
      
    8   In the same year she commenced a relationship with a Sydney man. The relationship was not an easy one, and was apparently punctuated by violence and moodiness on the part of her partner, but the offender valued it. It broke up in 1997 when her partner left her and went overseas. She was badly affected. She suffered something described by one writer as an hysterical fit. On impulse she flew to the United States of America and stayed in an hotel in Los Angeles. She seems to have attempted suicide by overdosing on aspirin and Panadol. Her memory of subsequent events is vague. She arrived in Mexico City, having apparently flown there from Los Angeles. She drifted from place to place. She told Professor Mullen, forensic psychiatrist, that it was as though her previous life had ceased to exist, as though she had died, leaving her problems behind her. After five weeks she returned to Australia and to her family, but told them little of her journey. 
     
      
    9   She discovered that she was pregnant. She was afraid to tell her family. They found out when the truth could be concealed no longer. They were ashamed. Her father and her brother decided what the family would do. The offender would be required to leave the family home and live with her brother, who was then living in another part of Melbourne. The pregnancy of the offender and the existence of the child, in due course, would not be mentioned to visiting relatives and friends. The offender’s youngest sister would not be told about it. The child would be adopted. It would be a family secret. The offender would, in due course, forget about the whole matter. 
     
      
    10   There was one girlfriend in whom the offender confided, and she told her that she was devastated by the family’s attitude. But she could not fight them and she complied with their wishes. She got in touch with Copelen Child and Family Services, an agency whose responsibility included seeing that appropriate advice and counselling were given and that those things were done which the law required. She told the agency that she wanted to offer her child for adoption when he was born. She already knew that she was to have a son. A social worker was assigned and explained the adoption procedure to her. 
     
      
    11   Her compliance was so great that, in order to avoid unnecessary attachment to her son, she insisted against the advice of her obstetrician on birth by caesarean section under general anaesthetic. Four days after his birth he was put into the care of foster parents pending the making of permanent arrangements. 
     
      
    12   The offender’s father and brother did not visit her in hospital and did not see the child. Her sister visited her once. 
     
      
    13   During November 1997 arrangements had to be made for the child to go into foster care and the offender’s agreement was necessary, so she had to have contact with Copelen and with a foster care agency. Those dealing with her noticed that throughout the process she seemed evasive. She was reluctant to give her address and wanted to maintain contact only by mobile telephone. She would not provide an address for the purposes of birth registration and would not give any details about the father. 
     
      
    14   A month after the birth, the offender ran away again. Impulsively, frightened and distressed, she drove to Portarlington where she drifted between motels for two weeks. Again, she attempted suicide by overdose. She called herself by a different name. As before, she equally suddenly returned to the family home. 
     
      
    15   On 16 December 1997 the offender signed an adoption consent at the County Court in Melbourne. She was informed that she could revoke her consent within twenty-eight days and about other rights, but she did not exercise them. In January 1998, after the time for revocation had expired, she was asked to sign a further form upon which it was customary for the parents of children to write something about themselves, their family and about the birth father. The offender refused to provide any such details and insisted that the agency move faster in the adoption process. There was another delay and the offender told Mr Kealy, the principal officer at Copelen, that she should have had an abortion, that it was so hard and taking far too long. In due course she was invited to select one out of eight families, whose details were provided to her, to be the adoptive parents. She chose Ms Strahan and Mr Gilding. Later on she was told they wanted to retain the child’s surname as a middle name but she was adamant that she did not want them to do that. It was obvious to Mr Kealy that the offender was having difficulty coping. He sensed that she had not received much care on an emotional level. She told him that she was “just hanging in”. 
     
      
    16   On 27 February 1998 the child was placed with Ms Strahan and Mr Gilding. They had been introduced by Centacare Catholic Family Services Adoption and Permanent Care. Centacare sent monthly progress reports and photographs to the offender as well as other details, including information about Ms Strahan and Mr Gilding. All this information was sent to an address at Port Melbourne, which was the address of the friend of the offender to whom I have previously referred. It was the only address the offender was prepared to use. 
     
      
    17   None of the offender’s family knew of these communications and I accept that they would have disapproved if they had known. At all relevant times the offender was living in the house of her parents or her brother and I think that she was at pains to avoid the risk that any relevant material might be sent to those places and remind her family about the taboo subject. 
     
      
    18   The offender went overseas for some time and returned in or about September 1998. She got in touch with Copelen and Centacare and said that she wanted the child back. She was told that that was not possible and she requested access. That was something to which she was entitled under the terms of the adoption protocol. Ms Allen of Centacare told her that Ms Strahan and Mr Gilding wanted to meet her and develop a relationship with her. 
     
      
    19   A meeting was arranged between the three of them and the child at Centacare’s office on 5 October 1998. After that the offender went to Copelen and wanted to talk to Mr Kealy about having the child returned to her care. She told Ms Allen that she wanted her to be an intermediary between herself and the adoptive parents and asked her to stop Mr Gilding telephoning her direct. Arrangements were attempted for a second meeting, and it was ultimately held at a house at Bells Beach on 8 November. That, apparently, was the house of the offender’s friend. Throughout these times the offender was refusing to provide the agencies with her address, consistently with her wish to conceal these matters from her family. 
     
      
    20   Ms Allen continued to be concerned about the attitude of the offender and thought her unprepared for the finalisation of the adoption. 
     
      
    21   The third meeting was arranged and eventually fixed to take place at Daylesford. 
     
      
    22   During the meeting Ms Strahan asked whether she might take a photograph of the offender and the child together. This was a request made in good faith and was one which the offender had previously refused. She believed, mistakenly I think, that she would not see her son again. She made an excuse to take him to her car. She drove him away from Daylesford. She had with her a kitchen knife that she had taken to use at the picnic. The details of what followed have to be inferred from things the police found in due course, but it seems clear that the offender stabbed the child a number of times in the chest with the kitchen knife and caused his death. That probably took place in the car. She took the body of the child and placed it a dam in the Perricoota State Forest, near Moama. 
     
      
    23   On 8 February 1999 police found her and her car at a motel at Moama. She told them that she had taken the child to his father. The front passenger’s seat of the car was covered in blood and she was unable to explain how it had got there. She agreed to go to Echuca police station and underwent an interview during which she persisted in the patently untrue story that she had taken the child to his natural father. She also said that she and the father had planned to arrange an adoption different from the one that was on foot. She said that she happened to be in Moama because she had run out of petrol at Deniliquin on the way home from Sydney to Melbourne. The parts of that story that were not immediately obviously untrue were soon established to be untrue. The police got in touch with the father, who confirmed that he did not have the child. The offender received that news with a remark that he was lying. 
     
      
    24   A second interview took place on the following day, but produced nothing significantly different. In the meantime, searches were going on for the child, who was suspected to have died. 
     
      
    25   The child’s body was found and a third interview took place between the offender and a police officer, this time in Melbourne. The offender told the police of her belief at the picnic that she would not see her son again, so she took him to the car and drove away. She was unable to give any coherent account about where she had taken the child. She said that she had got lost and driven around aimlessly. She said that after seeing a sign to a forest she had looked for a nice picnic area where she could spend some time with her son. When they were there he had called her “Mummy” for the first time. After that she could not recall exactly what had happened but she could remember placing her son in the dam before sitting on a hill and crying. She said that she did not know how the child had received his stab wounds but was aware that he was not moving when she placed him in the dam. She told the police that the blood on the passenger’s seat was the child’s blood. 
     
      
    26   The Court has been assisted by the tender of a large amount of evidence of psychiatric opinion. There is no substantial difference between the opinions of the different expert witnesses and it is upon such evidence that the plea of guilty of manslaughter was made and accepted. Professor Mullen was the first psychiatrist to interview the offender about this matter. He reviewed the offender’s family, academic, work and social history. He observed that when interviewed she made a curious impression by presenting with a brittle cheerfulness and a totally inappropriate casualness verging on detachment. At other times she would become intensely distressed. He considered that there were clear indications of significant depression. He thought that there was a history of depressive episodes. The first was probably in July 1996 when she was referred to Dr Leitmanis. The most severe occurred in 1998, when her sleep was severely disturbed and she ruminated on suicide. He considered that she was preoccupied with a sense of failure and guilt at that time, specifically related to giving up her baby for adoption. 
     
      
    27   Professor Mullen identified the flight of the offender to the United States of America and Mexico, her flight to Portarlington and the events of 7 February 1999 as fugues. Fugues are generally regarded as episodes of disturbed consciousness and disturbed behaviour which can occur in the context of a range of mental disorders. A fugue is a state to which certain vulnerable kinds of personality are predisposed. It is in a sense the extreme of a not uncommon tendency to respond to stresses and difficult situations by denial and avoidance. Those in a fugue state have a disturbed state of consciousness and their judgment and appreciation of reality are significantly disturbed. 
     
      
    28   The fugue is understandable at one level as an escape. In the offender’s case, the first two fugues involved a suicide attempt. Some writers, Professor Mullen said, have conceptualised fugues as a suicide equivalent and both suicide and fugues represent a flight from an intolerable reality. In his experience, fugues are most commonly seen emerging out of significant depression in vulnerable personalities. In his opinion the fugues in the present case had those characteristics. 
     
      
    29   Professor Mullen is of the opinion that at the time of the meeting at Daylesford the offender was suffering from a significant degree of depression. She was also facing a crisis which she was quite unable to accept, let alone to cope with. Having impulsively abducted the child, she transformed a difficult situation into one incapable of resolution. The combination of the stress, her state of mind and her vulnerable personality precipitated her once more into a flight from her dilemma and from her emotional turmoil. Then she travelled aimlessly until she reached the forest at Perricoota. 
     
      
    30   Professor Mullen’s opinion was that the offender’s state of mind would have been significantly disturbed over the period of the killing, though not enough to deprive her of the capacity to form intentions and carry through purposeful actions. She was cut off to a great extent from an awareness of who she was and of her past. She had a reduced perception of immediate realities and of the implications of her actions. 
     
      
    31   Professor Mullen thought it typical of those who have been in a fugue state to have partial or even totally absent recall for significant periods during the period of fugue. Like the investigating police officers, he tried to get the offender to explain how she killed the child. Like them, he was unsuccessful. Whenever he pressed her on the facts he was met with silence, with tears or with an express inability to remember. 
     
      
    32   It might be thought that the offender’s claim to amnesia was false in view of the facts that it was about her own recent acts that she was being asked and that on 8 February 1999 she had been prepared to lie in a serious and misleading way when asked about where the child was. However, Professor Mullen observed that her disturbed memory was not confined to the killing and its aftermath but was greater for the hours prior to her arrival at Perricoota Forest. That was consistent with a diagnosis of fugue. 
     
      
    33   Professor Mullen thought it reasonable to conclude from the fabricated account given by the offender on 8 February 1999 that she was aware at the very least that she had committed an act which she hoped to hide. He thought that she had some awareness, however rudimentary, that she had killed the child. However, he thought that conclusion not incompatible with her having been affected by a fugue state at the time of the killing. 
     
      
    34   The offender saw Dr Barry-Walsh at the request of the Crown. He, like Professor Mullen, noted her history and the improbable quality of her mood when being interviewed. He thought that the flight to the United States was not a fugue state but that the flight to Portarlington after giving up her child was more consistent with fugue. He thought that the offender’s state of mind after she took the child from Daylesford was possibly a fugue state. He commented on the impulsive decision, on the fact of little coherent memory of her subsequent actions and on the lack of recall of the attack itself. He considered it consistent with a mild depressive state superimposed on a chronic dysthymia. He thought that the history that the offender gave and the evidence of her subsequent actions, including the comments of witnesses that she stared and behaved as though in a trance, were consistent with a woman in a significantly dissociated state. He considered that she would have begun dissociating at the time she impulsively took the child. 
     
      
    35   Dr Barry-Walsh thought that the offender suffered from significant psychological disturbance. She had significant personality disorder. There had been periods of depression in addition to her typical pattern of emotional instability or dysthymia. Although she had the capacity to act in a purposeful and intended way her capacity to function in a cohesive, organised, planned and appropriate manner was impaired. That impairment extended to her capacity to exercise her judgment and think rationally about her predicament. Her behaviour represented a characteristic attempt to flee from an intolerable situation and diminished her appreciation of her actions at the time. 
     
      
    36   Dr Walton, another psychiatrist, has seen the offender eleven times since 16 February 1999. He agrees with the diagnosis of depressive disorder and considers the offender’s memory gap possibly indicative of a dissociative state. Like the other psychiatrists he considered that she was sufficiently mentally disorganised to be described as exhibiting an abnormality of mind at the material time. 
     
      
    37   Mr Joblin, a clinical psychologist, thought that the offender was suffering from severe psychological dysfunction. 
     
      
    38   The evidence establishes that the offender killed her child, intending to kill him and that at the time her capacity to understand events and to judge whether her actions were right or wrong was substantially impaired by her underlying condition of mind. 
     
      
    39   Sentencing in cases like the present begins with the recognition that there has been a felonious taking of a human life, here with intent to kill. The range of sentences is wide and depends to a significant degree upon the degree of impairment of the offender’s capacity and the effect it has upon the assessment of her criminal responsibility. A second important factor is the recognition of the need, where it exists, to protect the community. That need must be assessed at least partly by reference to the nature of the impairment of the offender’s mental capacity. 
     
      
    40   In Regina v Georgina Marie Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 Street CJ said at 402 - 
     
      
       
        
        The circumstances leading to the felonious taking of human life being regarded as manslaughter rather than murder can vary infinitely, and it is not always easy to determine in any given case what should be done in the matter of sentence. At the start it should be recognised that the felonious taking of a human life is recognised both in the  
        Crimes Act 
        , 1900 and in the community at large as one of the most dreadful crimes in the criminal calendar. The courts have, however, over the decades gradually manifested a willingness to recognise factual contexts which provide some basis for understanding the human tragedies that can lead to the taking of a life. The manifestation of this humanitarian tendency is necessarily attended by the utmost caution. It can be seen to be constantly written in the decisions of the courts and in the enactments of the legislature that the taking of a human life is a grave action calling for a correspondingly grave measure of criminal justice being meted out to the guilty party. 
        
       
       
        
         In a case such as the present, where there is material justifying a degree of understanding and of sympathy towards the appellant, the task of sentencing is particularly difficult. It is necessary to evaluate the demands of the criminal justice system, the expectations of the community at large, the subjective circumstances of the person coming forward for criminal judgment and the interest of society in protecting itself and its members from criminal activity amounting, as in the present case, to the taking of a life. 
        
       
      
    41   There is a great variety of activities which may constitute manslaughter, ranging from the morally almost innocent to the seriously culpable. It is for that reason that it is almost impossible to detect any clear pattern of sentencing for the crime of manslaughter. In such a case it is necessary to respect the community interest and the need for a deterrent sentence on the one hand, but to balance against that the particular circumstances of the case, objective and subjective. 
     
      
    42   A sentence can only have a deterrent effect to the community at large where the community can appreciate that there is a real degree of culpability on the part of the offender. Where the actions of the offender approach the morally innocent, little is demonstrated to the community by way of deterrence in the imposition of sentence. 
     
      
    43   The killing was impulsive. The reduction in the offender’s moral responsibility was great. She had been forced into an adoption she never approved of. She utterly lacked emotional support and she had to cope with the increasing problems posed by the adoption, which she was quite unable to solve. In this respect and in the other respects I have mentioned the case is quite extraordinary. An offender whose moral responsibility is so reduced by the presence of the incapacity she is demonstrated to have had is not in my opinion an appropriate medium for making an example to others. 
     
      
    44   I accept that there is no need for the sentence that I shall impose to deter the offender herself, for I do not believe that she will reoffend, or to protect the public. 
     
      
    45   The offender is now with her family once again. They have realised their error. They are supporting her at home and at work. They are encouraging her to undergo psychiatric treatment. She is seeing Dr Leitmanis regularly and taking his advice. I accept the evidence of Professor Mullen that her condition is treatable. The depression can be treated with a long-term course of drugs and she can be assisted with counselling and active psychotherapy to learn how to cope more effectively with everyday pressures. 
     
      
    46   The subjective features of the case strongly favour the offender. She pleaded guilty as soon as there existed evidence to justify a conviction for manslaughter. She is still young. She is of prior good character. She has no history or reputation for aggression or violence. As I have said, she is not a danger to society. Her rehabilitation is well in hand and she is receiving appropriate medical advice and treatment. 
     
      
    47   The Crown pointed to the fact that there was little articulated awareness on the part of the offender of the suffering she had caused to others. That is so, but I think that Professor Mullen is correct in thinking that the circumstances of the killing are so horrific for her and so overwhelming that she cannot respond other than with silence or tears. I accept that the offender is remorseful. She finds herself unable to talk about the facts of the killing, of course, but I accept that she was telling the truth to Professor Mullen when she said that she was feeling hopeless, and overwhelmed by guilt. I accept that her amnesia is genuine. 
     
      
    48   Before I pronounce sentence I should like to say something about the other people who have been affected by the death of this little boy. There must be many of them. The two most important are Ms Strahan and Mr Gilding. The child had been with them for a year. They were not responsible for the circumstances that led to this tragedy. Although the process of adoption was not quite complete, they regarded the child in every way as their own, as they were entitled to do. They suffered the pain of his loss. They suffered the anxiety and uncertainty which followed his abduction and the false reports of his whereabouts. They had to face the fact of his death. They will continue to suffer for a long time. It is appropriate for public acknowledgment to be made of these matters. I extend to them the sympathy of the Court and hope that they, too, will be healed in time. 
     
      
    49   In my opinion this is such an unusual case that a sentence of full-time custody is not called for. I propose to impose a suspended sentence on conditions including one which will promote the rehabilitation and treatment of the offender. 
     
      
    50   Maria Giulia Sette, I sentence you to imprisonment for a term of two years, commencing today and expiring on 5 July 2002. I suspend execution of the sentence for the same period of two years and direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a bond for the same period of two years. The bond will contain the following conditions - 
     
      
       
      a) that you appear before the Court if called on to do so at any time during the term of the bond; 
       
       
      b) that you be of good behaviour; 
       
       
      c) that you inform the Registrar of this Court of any change in your residential address; and 
       
       
      d) that you continue to consult Dr Leitmanis and accept any advice and treatment he offers, including advice about consulting other medical practitioners.

     REGINA v. BRETT ALAN LAWSON 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   GREG JAMES, J: This is an appeal pursuant to s.5D of the Criminal Appeal Act (1912) by the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of a sentence pronounced by his Honour Judge Bellear in the District Court of New South Wales on the respondent on a charge of larceny as a servant, to which charge he pleaded guilty and for which he was ordered to perform 450 hours of community service, on the simple ground that said sentence is inadequate. 
    2   The facts of the offence were presented to his Honour as unchallenged and are set out in his judgment. 
    3   At the relevant time the respondent and two other persons were employees of a company trading in butcher shops in the Sydney Metropolitan Area. One of those persons worked at the Chatswood Chase Shopping Centre. As part of his duties he had access to the combination of the safe in which money from sales was kept to be banked. The other person worked at another butcher's store operated by the same employer. The respondent also worked as a butcher at that store. 
    4   The respondent spoke to the other persons about obtaining illegally money from the safe at Chatswood and the combination for the safe was obtained by the two other employees and passed on to the respondent. Some $24,000 was taken from the safe. At the time the employee in charge of that safe was of the view that only he and one of those two persons to whom I have referred knew the combination. The taking was concealed in a sense, in that the locking mechanism of the safe was removed. 
    5   The proceeds were divided between the three persons at the respondent's instigation, with his retaining 50% of the proceeds and the other two taking some $6,000 each. Later, the other two confessed their part, pleaded guilty to being accessories before the fact to a charge of break, enter and steal and to a further charge of receiving the $6,000. Each was sentenced in the District Court by Judge Williams. Each had entered into arrangements which by the time they came forward for sentence they had substantially implemented to pay compensation to their employer. 
    6   Judge Williams in the District Court gave to each of them the benefit of reduced sentences both for their plea and their co-operation. So much appears from the remarks on sentence of Judge Bellear in the present proceedings. Regrettably, the remarks on sentence of his Honour Judge Williams have not been provided to us on this appeal. 
    7   The other two employees had received from Judge Williams the benefit of a recognisance for eighteen months on the receiving count and were required to complete 200 hours of community service on the break, enter and steal matter. 
    8   The offences under s.112 attracted a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment, while that under s.188, 10 years' imprisonment. The offence to which the respondent had pleaded guilty carried a maximum of ten years' imprisonment.  
    9   Judge Bellear found that the respondent was ""the leader of the pack and he had instigated this whole offence"". He adopted the finding in this regard of Judge Williams and also Judge Williams' finding that it was this respondent who had taken the bulk of the proceeds and who had been responsible for the division. 
    10   His Honour Judge Bellear referred to the evidence before him on sentence that the respondent had taken the money out of both need and some misplaced sense of grievance against his employer and expressed remorse and contrition. His Honour expressed the view that the respondent should receive credit for a plea of guilty which, albeit entered on the day of trial, appeared to have been entered on the first occasion on which the option of pleading to one count was made available to him and at a time at which the Crown might have been embarrassed in seeking to proceed with the trial. His Honour gave the utilitarian benefit of a plea which saved the cost of trial to the respondent and found contrition. 
    11   His Honour noted also that the respondent and the co-offenders were stated to be good workers for the company and that the respondent was voluntarily willing to make compensation to his employer and that that willingness had been accepted by the employer and an agreement for payment entered into. 
    12   His Honour referred to the respondent's personal circumstances in relation to the support of his wife and child; to his regret and to his necessity to have to embark on a considerable regime of sacrifice in order to be able to obtain and maintain employment such as enabled him to meet his financial commitments and also to make the compensation payments, so that apparently he walks on occasions when public transport is not available, a distance of, in the order of, 25 kilometres (expressed in the judgment as 14 kilometres either way, which figures have been corrected before us in the evidence to which I will refer) to get to and from his employment. 
    13   His Honour had regard to the offence as being a breach of trust and had regard to the offence as involving some degree of planning. Both matters have been urged upon us as, however, insufficiently weighted in his Honour's conclusion. 
    14   His Honour concluded that, particularly having regard to the sentence given to the two co-offenders, notwithstanding the benefits they received for their assistance and their early pleas of guilty, his Honour proposed not to send the respondent to prison and imposed a sentence of 450 hours of community service, which sentence was directed to commence within seven days of 18 January, the day on which his Honour passed sentence. 
    15   In that regard it appears to me that his Honour had regard to the principles as expressed in Postiglione v. The Queen (1995-96) 189 CLR 295 and Regina v. Hodges (1997) 95 A. Crim. R. 85. His Honour appears to have given to the plea such weight at least in the circumstances in which it was entered as to afford no just basis for the Crown to complain on a Crown appeal. The plea was entered to one of three counts; that plea was accepted in full discharge; that plea, as evidence of contrition, was amply supported by the evidence the respondent himself gave, with which it appears his Honour was impressed, and which certainly is impressive to me as evidence of contrition on my reading of it. 
    16   True it was that the co-accused had received less by way of proceeds and, to an extent, had a lesser role, a lesser but essential role in that it was the co-accused that supplied the safe combination. True it was that they received a discount for co-operation, but the sentence his Honour passed upon this respondent was double, or more than double, that passed upon the co-accused, albeit it was a sentence of the same nature. 
    17   The arrangement for restitution was such as to involve considerable sacrifice and, in my view, fell well within the principles enunciated by this court in The Queen v. Phelan (1993) 66 A. Crim. R. 446 and enunciated by Hunt, CJ. at CL. at 448. 
    18   Given that the co-accused's sentences are not the subject of appeal and bearing in mind that appeals by way of Crown appeals are particularly apt for the circumstance in which, cutting across time-honoured concepts of criminal administration, as they do, they are necessary to correct error of principle, given that there is a discretion in the courts, particularly where a parity question is involved, even though the court might be of the view that a sentence was inadequate (see Regina v. Allpass (1994) 73 A. Crim. R. 561 at 562-563) to dismiss the appeal, having regard to the consequences in particular of a re-sentencing of the respondent, and further having regard to the fresh evidence tendered on this appeal which shows on the question of discretion that the respondent has completed a substantial portion of the community service order and has not otherwise come under adverse notice. I am of the view that in the almost unique circumstances of this case, which should not in any way be regarded as a precedent for the imposition of community service orders in respect of substantial breaches of trust - for example, in cases of stealing from an employer - the appeal in the present matter should be dismissed. I therefore propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
    19   GILES, JA: I agree. 
    20   DUNFORD, J: I also agree. 
    21   GILES, JA: The order of the court will therefore be the appeal is dismissed.

     REGINA v Leanne Maree MOORE 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1    NEWMAN J: This is a Crown appeal against a sentence passed by her Honour Judge Latham DCJ at the Campbelltown District Court on 11 February this year. 
     
      
    2    Before her Honour the respondent maintained a plea of guilty which she had first made on 4 August 1999 to a charge of supplying a prohibited drug; namely, methylamphetamine in that she had in her possession an amount of the drug which was not less than the trafficable quantity. Her plea first recorded on 4 August 1999, was not a plea made at the first available opportunity. 
     
      
    3    Her plea on 4 August 1999 was on a day when her matter was set down for trial. I shall revert to the significance of the timing of the plea later in my reasons. 
     
      
    4    The charge was laid pursuant to s 25(1) of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985. The maximum penalty is fifteen years imprisonment and/or a fine of $220,000. It follows that the crime in question is one which has significant standing in the criminal calendar. 
     
      
    5    Together with the charge of supply prohibited drug the respondent asked her Honour to take into account two counts of possessing an unauthorised firearm. This her Honour did. In the event, her Honour sentenced the respondent to a Community Service Attendance Order of some thirty-six hours. 
     
      
    6    The Crown's prime submission is that the sentence imposed by her Honour is manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    7    The facts of the matter are in relatively short compass. As a consequence of investigations carried out, police executed a search warrant at premises at number 9 Billikin Way, Ambarvale, at which premises the respondent resided. At the time when police made entry to the premises they found the respondent home and also, on entering, they came across a gentleman by the name of Mark Gardner who was engaged in the use of a computer in the premises. 
     
      
    8    A search carried out by police discovered methylamphetamine together with paraphernalia not inconsistent with drug dealing. The amount of methylamphetamine found weighed 53.9 grams, in one bag, and .07 grams in another bag. Later analysis showed that the pure quantity of methylamphetamine in the bag containing 53.9 grams was of a much lesser weight. 
     
      
    9    However, the New South Wales statute, unlike that of the equivalent statute of the Commonwealth, deals with weight in admixture and not in pure weight. The weight of drug found took it squarely within the bounds of s 25(1) as being an amount not less than a trafficable quantity. 
     
      
    10    In a record of interview carried out by police shortly after the apprehension of the respondent she admitted that she had supplied the drug to a friend on an occasion. The scales which were found which, as I have said, are part of the paraphernalia of drug dealing, she claimed she used for weighing aspirin. 
     
      
    11    I might say that the scepticism of this excuse advanced by the Crown before this Court this morning is a scepticism perhaps which could be easily shared. 
     
      
    12    Be that as it may, the plea of guilty in the circumstances was one which overcame some difficulties which the Crown may have had in proving its case. The prime difficulty which I would point to is the fact that at the time of her apprehension there was another adult in the house, the gentleman Gardner, and it may well be that in the course of the trial the Crown may have had some difficulty in establishing that it was the respondent rather than Gardner who was the person guilty of supply. 
     
      
    13    Having said that, there are a number of features in her Honour's sentence which cause disquiet. The Crown rightly submitted that her Honour made no reference to either general or personal deterrence in her sentence. 
     
      
    14    This Court has, on many occasions, indicated that in cases of drug supply, questions of both general and personal deterrence are matters which the Court should take into account: see Regina v Clark, unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal 15 March 1990, as an example of this Court's attitude towards deterrence in drug matters. 
     
      
    15    Secondly, her Honour, in delivering her reasons, clearly stated that she was giving maximum weight in terms of mitigation to the respondent's plea of guilty. 
     
      
    16    While it would be appropriate for her Honour to have given weight of some significance to the plea of guilty, to give full weight to a plea of guilty where that plea was not made at the earliest opportunity, in my view, is a matter of error. Here when the plea was entered on 4 August 1999 the case was set down for trial. Expense, no doubt, had been incurred in arranging witnesses to be present and other matters of preparation for trial which necessarily involved the expenditure of public funds. Indeed, the fact that the plea was not made at the first available opportunity is contra-indicative of absolute contrition. 
     
      
    17    Having said that, it would have been appropriate for her Honour to have taken the plea of guilty into account by way of mitigation but not to give that plea the weight she did. 
     
      
    18    The Crown also relied upon a submission that the respondent, by her statement in the record of interview that the scales found on the premises were used for the weighing of aspirin, is an indication of lack of contrition. As I have indicated earlier, the only admission made by the respondent which went directly to supply was the fact that she conceded to police that she had in fact supplied the subject drug to a friend. 
     
      
    19    Her Honour was greatly influenced, as she made transparently clear in her reasons, by the respondent's personal circumstances. A report from a cardiologist indicated that the respondent is suffering from a very profound cardiological condition, so profound that the morbidity rate flowing from that condition is in the order of twenty per cent a year. It is also very disabling, so disabling that in a pre-sentence report it stated that her physical condition would prevent her carrying out work under a Community Service Work Order. 
     
      
    20    This induced her Honour to make an order of a Community Service Attendance Centre Order which, of course, means that the respondent is not required to carry out any work in the discharge of her obligations under that order. 
     
      
    21    Also her family circumstances were of importance to her Honour. The respondent has children. One of those children is, regrettably, under notice by police and care of those children is a matter of some conjecture should the respondent be incarcerated. 
     
      
    22    For myself, I am of the view that her Honour perhaps overstated the situation when she said, in sentencing: 
     
      
       
        
        But for her health condition and her genuine contrition, I would have imposed a sentence of periodic detention."" 
        
       
      
    23    I am of the view that the sentence passed is inadequate. However, having regard to the medical condition of the respondent and the principles of double jeopardy, I am of the view that this is a case where the court should exercise its discretion and dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    24    I would thus propose that this Court should make an order dismissing the appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    25    SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree. 
     
      
       
      
    26    GREG JAMES J: I do also. 
     
      
       
      
    27    SPIGELMAN CJ: The order of the Court is that the appeal is dismissed.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JFriday, 16 June 200070056/99 - REGINA v Harry ROBINSONSENTENCE1   HIS HONOUR: The offender was found guilty by a jury of the murder on 17 September 1998 at Junee of John Thomas Kennett. The offender was an inmate of Junee Correctional Centre in September 1998 when the deceased began to occupy a cell in the same part of the gaol as the offender’s cell. The deceased was serving a sentence following his conviction for sexual offences on schoolchildren within his charge, and that fact came to be suspected by the inmates of that part of the gaol, including the offender. Papers were obtained from the deceased’s cell, confirming the suspicion, and a discussion took place about giving the deceased a hiding and getting rid of him from that part of the gaol. The offender said that he would thump the deceased. He and another inmate went to the deceased’s cell and set about him, punching and kicking him. The offender was concentrating on the deceased’s head and the other inmate on the lower part of the body. The offender was wearing joggers and delivered a large number of kicks to the head. The cause of death was blunt force head injury. There were a number of fractures of the bones, namely of the right side of the jaw bone and of the nose, as well as extensive bruising under the skin over the right side of the cheek and the jaw. There was a tear beneath the upper lip. Teeth were broken and there was bleeding on the inside of the skull over the surface of the brain. 
     
      
    2   The offender was carrying an injury to his knee and wore an elastic bandage to support it. After the attack he said that he was sorry that he had not been able to stomp harder on the deceased’s head because of his knee injury. 
     
      
    3   The offender was born in Australia on 2 May 1972 of Lebanese parents. He is the third eldest of nine children and was raised in a family described by the reporting Probation and Parole officer as dysfunctional. He was the subject of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of his father and a male associate of his father. At an early age he became violent and began staying away from school and stealing things from shops. Between the ages of eleven and sixteen he spent a significant amount of time in Darlinghurst as a prostitute. He began drinking alcohol at age thirteen and using heroin and other illegal drugs at age sixteen. All these things alienated him from his family. 
     
      
    4   In September 1991 the offender was convicted of several robbery offences and sentenced to imprisonment incorporating a minimum term which expired in November 1994. He was released to parole but within two weeks was arrested on a charge of assault with intent to rob. That resulted in a sentence incorporating a minimum term of two years’ imprisonment dating from December 1994. In December 1996 he again obtained parole but that parole was revoked in July 1997 following his arrest on charges of robbery whilst armed and robbery with aggravation. He was serving that sentence at the time of the events the subject of this sentence. 
     
      
    5   In January 1998 he was admitted to the Kevin Waller Unit at Long Bay gaol because it was feared that he might harm himself. He stayed there until July 1998 and during that time was reported a number of times for irresponsible behaviour. He had been at Junee Correctional Centre for about three months when he murdered the deceased. 
     
      
    6   During his current term of imprisonment the offender has misconducted himself many times, often for aggressive behaviour and drug offences. He is addicted to the use of alcohol and illegal and prescription drugs, and has been so since his teenage years. He has taken part in intensive treatment for these addictions, but only spasmodically in recent times. He has participated in a methadone programme, both in the community and whilst in custody. 
     
      
    7   He has attempted suicide and mutilated himself on a number of occasions and has been admitted for psychiatric care on five occasions. 
     
      
    8   He received intensive psychological counselling before being sentenced in 1997 and immediately afterwards. In 1998 a psychologist attached to the Kevin Waller Unit described the offender as deeply disturbed and Professor Finlay-Jones, psychiatrist, diagnosed him as one of the worst cases of borderline personality disorder he had encountered. 
     
      
    9   The offender has spent all but a few months of his adult life in prison. The violence and sexual assaults perpetrated on him as a child left him severely emotionally disturbed. This disturbance and his addiction to alcohol and to illegal and prescription drugs are responsible for his serious and repeated misbehaviour. 
     
      
    10   The offender is described as having had various “association difficulties” with other inmates which are likely to get in the way of a lower classification. He has told those reporting on him that he does not take a backward step when confronted. 
     
      
    11   Psychiatric reports were received from Dr Nielssen and Dr Clarke. Dr Nielssen diagnoses a severe personality disorder with anti-social and borderline traits. Dr Clarke diagnoses borderline personality disorder with transitory psychotic states. 
     
      
    12   Documents tendered contain a number of vague references to schizophrenia, but I do not accept that the offender has been or is suffering from schizophrenia. I do not accept the existence of transitory psychotic states. I accept that the offender experiences unstable moods with dysphoria and episodes of sudden anger, which he will find difficult to control. I accept that he is likely to continue to abuse alcohol and other drugs with the intention of modifying his unpleasant moods and thoughts with a consequent inability to control his violent urges. 
     
      
    13   This continuing state of mind, coupled with a hatred of homosexual men, has the potential to result in real danger for anyone with whom he comes into contact and whom he believes is homosexual. 
     
      
    14   However, there are some hopes that he may be able to modify his behaviour. 
     
      
    15   A psychologist at Goulburn Correctional Centre has recently reported a significant improvement in his emotional outlook, which might be attributable to the death of his mother in May 1999. The offender is reported as saying that his mother’s illness and death have led him to reconsider his values and his direction in life. 
     
      
    16   There are signs also that the offender is aware of the danger to which I have referred and is prepared to take steps, if he can, to avoid that danger. He has been reported by Mr Kay, the Programs Manager at Goulburn Correctional Centre, as claiming that he did not want to be transferred to Junee for reasons including the fact that he had great difficulty dealing with inmates incarcerated for sexual assaults on children. There is also evidence to suggest that he is no longer suicidal. 
     
      
    17   He is reported as saying that he has begun practising the Muslim religion, the religion of his family, and in accordance with its teachings has forgiven his father. Unfortunately, since the offender chose not to give evidence it is difficult to place much weight on that assertion. 
     
      
    18   I conclude that although the offender may be able to understand why he loses his self control, he still largely lacks the ability to gain self control. It is not certain that he will gain that ability, but if he does so it will not be for many years. It is possible to say, I think, that he has some prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    19   The offender claims to remember nothing of the attack on the deceased, but I do not accept that claim. He has told some reporters that his amnesia is feigned. It seems clear that when he realised that a convicted paedophile was living in his part of the correctional centre, he decided to attack and injure him in order to have the authorities move him to another part of the centre. So much appears obvious from the things he said and the way he went about the attack. He was wearing joggers and, although he delivered a vicious kicking, he used no weapon. What is also clear is that he utterly lost control of himself so that he ended up killing his victim, though he intended only to give him a severe beating. 
     
      
    20   It was submitted that the offender and his companion were incited to carry out their attack by another prisoner, who had sexual designs on the deceased and was embarrassed when the members of the gaol population realised that the deceased was a paedophile. It may be accepted that the inmate concerned approved of the deceased’s being beaten, but I do not think that that approval or even any encouragement mitigated the offender’s criminality. He was not beholden to the inmate concerned or, I think, influenced to do anything he was not eager to do. He volunteered to attack the deceased. 
     
      
    21   The offence does not fall into the worst category of murders, though it has very serious aspects, namely the offender’s apparent inability to stop himself going and attacking a man who had given him no personal offence, his inability to control his actions once he entered upon the attack, the serious and sustained violence of the attack and the fact that the attack was carried out in the company of another on a defenceless man. 
     
      
    22   These matters make it a very serious offence of its kind and combine to produce the need for a strongly deterrent sentence. 
     
      
    23   The offender does not acknowledge his responsibility for the death, so there is no question of any leniency for remorse. 
     
      
    24   I propose to order this sentence to commence on 12 December 1999, the commencement date of the additional term of the sentence the offender was serving when he murdered the deceased. Apart from a period of time between December 1996 and July 1997 the offender has been in prison continuously since February 1991. The non-parole period of the sentence I impose will therefore be accumulated upon an effective period of imprisonment of more than eight years. That circumstance gives rise to the need for a non-parole period that is less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence I shall impose, and allow a period of eligibility for parole sufficient to enable the offender to have a suitably long and graduated period of introduction to a society outside prison that will be quite unknown to him. There is no other circumstance giving rise to that need. The non-parole period will be the minimum period that I can properly impose in view of the serious objective nature of the offence. 
     
      
    25   The offender is convicted of the murder on 17 September 1998 at Junee of John Thomas Kennett and is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of twenty-two years, commencing on 12 December 1999 and expiring on 11 December 2021. I set a non-parole period of fifteen years. The offender will become eligible to be released on parole on 11 December 2014.

     FRIDAY 16 JUNE 2000 
      
      
      
      REGINA v. FABRIZIO CALDERONI 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: Following the offender's trial for murder at which he was acquitted, he was, as a consequence of the evidence he gave on oath at that trial, indicted by ex officio indictment on a charge under s.97 of the Crimes Act 1900 of robbery in company. His acquittal of the murder charge means that he has to be taken for all purposes as not guilty of that crime. 
    2   In his sentencing, I have regard to the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act). 
    3   His admissions made on oath at that trial were admissions that plainly were of assistance to the prosecution and, indeed, amplified and explained otherwise inadequate evidence contained in recorded conversations and some limited evidence given by an indemnified protected witness who was herself involved in the very matters, at least to the extent of being an accessory after the fact. The Crown has submitted, however, that the offender was not being altruistic or, alternatively, that his degree of remorse and contrition for the relevant offence cannot be much assisted by assistance given that way. Indeed the Crown goes so far as to say that the unsuspecting assistance he plainly did give in the recorded conversations and that given by way of his admissions on trial for the more serious offence is not to be regarded as within the concept of assistance to which s.23 of the Act speaks. I do not accept that submission. Clearly the offender afforded assistance whether he wanted or intended to or not.  
    4   It is also necessary to take into account that it has been conceded in these proceedings that the time during which the offender was in custody should be regarded as referrable to this charge, he having been acquitted of the murder charge, and therefore pursuant to s.24 I should take into account the one month 19 days he spent in custody, although that will have to be done by way of adjustment to the period of sentence since he has been on bail for an extensive period of time following that period in custody. 
    5   Further, it is clear that except for an application to stay the indictment on a misconceived basis that there was somehow an abuse involved in indicting the offender for that which he had confessed at a trial for another offence, the offender pleaded guilty at the earliest possible opportunity after charging and thus should be entitled to a discount in accordance with s.22 of the Act. 
    6   I am of the view that he should receive some substantial discount for his plea of guilty bearing in mind that it proceeded upon his own admissions in evidence and that it has saved the community cost and inconvenience considering when and how he was charged with this offence. In itself I am of the view it is not particularly persuasive of remorse or contrition but a recognition of an overwhelming case against him on his own sworn evidence. Nonetheless the other side of that proposition is that that evidence was itself of the most dramatic assistance to the Crown so that the overwhelming case available against him was a case of his own making and he should therefore receive the credit under s.23(2)(b),(c) and (d). I must have regard to that, to the plea and to his conduct subsequent to the offence as well as his conduct during the trial and up to this point so that I might ascertain in accordance with s.23(2)(j) what is the likelihood of the offender will commit further offences after release. 
    7   It is notable that when having regard to the matters referred to by s.23 I must not impose a lesser penalty so that the penalty imposed would be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. Authority establishes that the penalty might be disproportionate or indeed unreasonable, but not unreasonably disproportionate (see Queen v Huang 1995 78 A. Crim. R. 111). 
    8   No such restriction was enacted as qualifying the discount to be given under s.22 or the general power to pass a lesser sentence provided for by s.21. Nonetheless there remains the general obligation to pass a sentence which adequately recognises the objective circumstances of the offence and those circumstances personal to the particular offender which might qualify the otherwise overly grave impact of a sentence merely concerned with the objective criteria on the individual. 
    9   Turning to more general matters. Since the passing of Act the sentencing regime in this State has changed dramatically. In particular that change reflects the necessity now to impose a total sentence, in the event that a custodial sentence is being imposed, and then to consider the fixing within that total sentence of a period of imprisonment during which an offender is not to be released. 
    10   Section 44 provides for the new regime. In Regina v. Carroll [2000] NSWSC 410 at paras.43-45, I discussed the new regime and the changes it has brought. It provides for a number of sentencing options including full-time custody. 
    11   The new regime restores the approach taken prior to the Sentencing Act as to imposing a total sentence and in relation to those matters to be given consideration when imposing a sentence of full-time custody as affecting both head sentence and non-parole period and referred to by the High Court of Australia, in particular, in Regina v. Bugmy (1990) 169 CLR 525. 
    12   Qualifying the application of those principles, a common law principle that a sentence of full-time custodial imprisonment is to be considered as an option of last resort amongst other sentencing options seems to have developed in recent years perhaps in consequence of s.17A of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 and has now received statutory recognition in the Act. It is accepted by the Crown here that I should have recourse to that principle. 
    13   Also, the Act has re- introduced into New South Wales the concept of suspended sentences. Since suspension of sentences has not been available for many years, there is little law in this State of modern times concerning when a suspended sentence might properly be passed.  
    14   The Crown has drawn my attention to South Australian and Victorian provisions and authority as has counsel for the offender but the Crown has submitted the statutory regime in those two States is materially different. Further, the legislation makes provision for community service orders and periodic detention. It is in that context I should turn to the facts on which I proceed to sentence. They were agreed between the parties. 
    15   The offender met Graeme Brown in Alice Springs about the end of 1986 when he and his then partner, Sandy Hamilton, stayed at a house occupied by Brown and one ""Roslyn Rogers (""Ros"") also known as ""Patricia Adams"". He returned to Brisbane in November 1987 and his relationship with Ms. Hamilton ceased in late 1990. The offender started seeing a Karen Skinner. At the beginning of 1991, he and Ms. Skinner went to Long Jetty and stayed with ""Ros"" for a while before renting a place next door. 
    16   About June 1991, Brown visited ""Ros"" a couple of times. The offender saw him about three to four days prior to 11 June 1991 and again on 11 June 1991. 
    17   At the earlier meeting, Brown told the offender that, 'someone had ripped him off … he wanted it back … and might want me to help"". Further, ""Ros"" had lent him $7,000 and she wanted it back. The offender said he understood Brown to mean that, ""I would go along with him, just to see him get his money back - there could be a fight or anything"". The offender knew he might have to be involved in violence on someone to get money. If they were going to beat (Brown) up or something, ""I probably would have stepped in"". Brown mentioned to the offender that a drug dealer was going to buy some drugs, or that is what he had been given to think. Brown had told him he had grass for sale. Brown had arranged for the drug dealer to come to Wyong. The victim, Marneros, apparently came to Wyong to fulfil that role. 
    18   About 8.00 pm on 11 June 1991, Brown turned up at the offender's residence and about an hour later left with the offender and Skinner in the offender's car. Brown dropped the offender and Skinner off at a street near the railway line at Wyong saying, ""wait here, I'll turn up later on with this guy"". The offender and Skinner waited in the dark for about two hours. A car they did not recognise came up the road and stopped nearly opposite their position. The offender saw two people in the car. 
    19   It was not until the occupant on the passenger's side got out of the vehicle, after a lapse of between 30 seconds to a minute, that the offender recognised him as being Brown who called out, ""where are youse?"". The offender and Skinner approached the vehicle and saw that Brown had opened the driver's door. The offender saw, ""what looked to me was the guy was already punched in"", ""he didn't move, you know, he was unconscious sort of thing"". The offender maintained he didn't see Brown hit the man next to him because it was dark, and could not recall seeing any blood on him. 
    20   Brown told the offender to open the rear passenger's door and said, ""there is a bag in the back, grab it"". The offender did so and saw Brown and Skinner remove the driver from the front of the vehicle and put him in the boot. The offender denied touching the person. He said he threw the bag to Brown. 
    21   The offender and Skinner made their own way back to the offender's residence with Brown arriving separately about five to 10 minutes later. ""Ros"" showed the offender that she had received some money although he did not know how much. 
    22   The offender maintained that he did not carry a weapon during the robbery. He did not see Brown with any weapon and Skinner did not have a weapon to his knowledge. 
    23   Evidence given in the trial by the witnesses Garry Thoburn and Bernard Bridge indicates that Marneros had about $50,000 in cash with him just prior to the robbery. George Page, also known as ""Fat George"", said that he brought somewhere between $4,500 and $6,000 to Wyong to give to Marneros. ""Fat George"" was of the view that Marneros had other money with him and that it was possible Marneros was doing a drug deal. 
    24   ""Ros"" said that Brown gave her $7,000 when he returned to the offender's house but apart from alleging that the offender had said to her, ""Brett and I will get $10,000 each"", there is no evidence that the offender received anything from Brown. The offender maintained that he neither asked for nor received any money from Brown and this cannot be refuted by the Crown. 
    25   Those facts establish that the offender was not a prime mover in the scheme to rob but joined in more or less on a casual basis to provide physical support and assistance in a project to rob a drug dealer. His assistance was at the instigation of Brown who, it was accepted in the Crown submissions and by reason of the acquittal verdict in the murder trial was the murderer of the victim drug dealer. It was Brown who devised the criminal scheme. 
    26   The Crown's concession that it was not possible to establish that this accused received much of, if any, of the proceeds of the robbery is understandable and explicable in the light of the delay in investigation since whatever be the explanation for it this is a matter that was really not investigated until 1996 and not even then exhaustively investigated until recently. 
    27   The offender's role appears to have been to help out as ordered and to assist in stealing money. He, certainly on the Crown case at the murder trial, realised the deceased was dead at some time before getting back to the premises at the Central Coast, where they met up afterwards, however, bearing in mind his evidence and bearing in mind the verdict it is not possible for me to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he became aware that the dealer was dead at any point earlier than the morning following the death. It is certainly not open to me to conclude that he was aware he was robbing a dead body or disposing of a dead body. He is not charged with any offence relating to the perversion of the course of justice, the assisting of Brown after the event or the concealing of the crime. Sentences passed upon the others involved yield little of assistance. These sentences were for offences entirely different to this offence. 
    28   The offender was born on 9 April 1968. He was 23 at the time of this offence. He has worked in the underpinning business and as a bobcat driver for a family friend for a considerable time and has enjoyed in the years since the commission of his crime an industrious and working character. The only other matters recorded against him are shoplifting and traffic offences, for which he has received small fines. They are of no real relevance. The Crown concedes that the offender's prior record may be disregarded for the purpose of sentencing in respect of this charge. 
    29   His particular personal circumstances were set out unchallenged in submissions provided by his counsel, in statements of Mr. Monteverde and Mr. Pezzimenti, which were Exhibits 1 and 2 respectively, and in paragraphs two to seven of his counsel's written submissions. 
    30   There can be no doubt that since the commission of the offence, the offender has spent many years in a state of suspense during which time he has evidenced his rehabilitation and the matters set out in the two statements to which I have referred and in those paragraphs of his counsel's submissions make clear how far that rehabilitation has gone. 
    31   In the Probation and Parole Service report is some reference to an unsuitability for community service in Queensland due to his failure to work under a Queensland community service order. Nothing can be found in his record which might suggest he had been subject to a Queensland community service order. I disregard that reference. I find the reports of limited assistance, because although those reports assessed him as suitable for periodic detention they reject home detention and community service orders in particular not because of other unsuitability notwithstanding he is on a methadone programme but because of his Queensland residence. 
    32   It is accepted by the Crown that in sentencing I should not discriminate against him because of his residence in Queensland and that would mean that insofar as community service and home detention were concerned, if they were to be available, and if rejected for that reason alone, other options would have to be considered short of imprisonment. I am, however, firmly of the view that they would not, in all the circumstances, have been appropriate in this case. 
    33   I had earlier mentioned in relation to the plea of guilty and the assistance that I didn't regard the plea in itself as of much value on the question of remorse and contrition. I was, however, dramatically impressed with the offender's remorse and contrition when he gave his evidence during the murder trial and was cross-examined. He had drawn to his attention his own statements that he had not realised were being recorded when he spoke to the indemnified witness. There can be no doubt that a lot of what he said was said in panic seeking to avoid responsibility for the murder of which he was found not guilty, nonetheless it is perfectly clear he regretted his involvement with Brown and the death of the deceased. 
    34   I am of the view that the high degree of remorse and contrition I find adds great force to what I have held as being his rehabilitation. These evidence well for the future and in particular as indicating a lack of likelihood that he would further offend as is referred to in particular in s.23(2)(j).  
    35   The Crown submits that the sentence should reflect general and personal deterrent. The custodial sentence which I am minded to impose will specifically be imposed for that reason, that is, that it will contain, notwithstanding the matters of rehabilitation to which I have referred, the extensive period of time since the commission of the offence and the four years or so since the latest investigation of it, real components of general and specific deterrence.  
    36   In Regina v. Petrinovic [1999] NSWSC 1131, when seeking to ascertain the relevant culpability involved in a murder which resulted from a robbery where the victim was unexpectedly killed, I referred to the principles of proportionality and punishment explained by the High Court in Veen v. The Queen (No. 2) (1997-1998) 164 CLR 465 and in particular the principle that all sentencing has as its ultimate goal the protection of the community. I particularly referred to the necessity when sentencing that offender and his co-accused to have regard to the fact that those who embark upon robberies, robberies being offences of violence, whether as principal or as the principals assistant, must realise that they run the risks of injuring or killing the victims and that such offences are to be regarded for sentencing purposes as offences of great seriousness not just because people are deprived of property but because they are threatened, may be injured and may be killed. Yet, of course, when I come to sentence for robbery it is important that I do not allow the fact that someone was killed to affect the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate. It is in these circumstances appropriate for me to have regard, however, to what the courts have said as to the objective seriousness of such a crime. 
    37   In the present case, however, reasonable proportionality involves regard to the minor role performed by the offender in the robbery and to the circumstances of his recruitment. I must also in that regard consider appropriately the Crown's concession that there are plainly in this case such circumstances as would warrant, if I am minded to impose a parole period, a variation of the statutory proportion referred to in s.44(1) and (2) of the Act in favour of the offender. Those circumstances would include: the age of the matter; the time during which the offender was kept in suspense; the rehabilitation he has substantially succeeded in achieving; his prospects for the future including the lack of likelihood of further offences, and for those reasons it would be appropriate that he should spend much less time in gaol than would otherwise be the case. But in making what, in my view, was an entirely appropriate concession of those matters the Crown does not go so far as to concede he should not spend time in gaol at all. 
    38   It appears from the drafting of s.12 of the Act which permits sentence to be suspended and certainly both counsel submit that this is the case, were the sentence to be suspended it would have to be wholly suspended. The Crown submits that this is not an appropriate case for a sentence to be wholly suspended, although it does submit that appropriately the shortest possible sentence should be imposed and in that regard has drawn my attention to what was said in Regina v. Jones (1985) 14 A. Crim. R. 364. 
    39   Regina v. Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517 and Mill v. The Queen (1988 )106 CLR 59 provide authoritative support for the proposition that when a court comes to sentence long after the crime in question it can have regard to the events since the crime and prior to sentence to enable it to determine a sentence which might otherwise be seen as unduly lenient but which accords with the court's sense of what is appropriate for the protection of the community at the time at which sentence is passed. In particular, that means that in such a circumstance, as with a re-determination of life sentence as occurred under the former s.14A of the Sentencing Act (1989), a much better prediction may be made for the future because of the greater information available as to what had happened in the past. 
    40   It is in that context that the question of maintaining the rehabilitation already demonstrated by the offender for the protection of the community in the future assumes dramatic importance when one considers that to require an offender to serve a sentence of imprisonment in those circumstances might fracture the vulnerable rehabilitation already achieved. The relevant sentencing purposes will be achieved by passing a sentence which denounces the crime but the effect of which is suspended whilesoever rehabilitation continues. 
    41   The submission that is put by counsel for the offender is that this was an isolated incident, and the whole of the evidence attests to the offender's rehabilitation and prospects for the future. He submits that the infrastructure to maintain that rehabilitation exists and that it should not be set at nought by requiring the offender actually to serve a sentence of imprisonment and this, he says, is a case of exceptional circumstances, citing what was said in Regina v. Govinden (1999) 106 A. Crim. R. 314. The submission is that in the peculiar circumstances of this case where the offender has come forward for sentence so long after these events and where the Crown has been able to proceed because of the offender providing against himself the evidence on which the Crown has indicted him and where there is so clearly rehabilitation, I should in these extraordinary circumstances and in the community interest not put that rehabilitation at risk. That is a submission that I am of the view I should accept. 
    42   I shall sentence the offender to imprisonment, for a period of two years less the period the offender has served in custody pursuant to s.45(1)(c). I will decline to set a non-parole period since it appears to me that it is appropriate that I should suspend sentence and it appears that in the context of the Act that suspension must be of the whole of the sentence. That suspension will be supported by a good behaviour bond for a term which I consider should be for the whole term of the sentence. The question of any conditions for that bond will need to be considered as well as the form of the appropriate order to be made, giving credit for the two years period in custody and providing for those conditions. 
    43   I will hear the parties on whether there should be any particular conditions bearing in mind his residence in Queensland other than that he be of good behaviour for the entire term of the suspension and appear for sentence if called upon. 
     
      
     (After hearing submissions) 
      
    44   On the Crown's concession that, on the findings I have made as to rehabilitation and as to the evidence concerning his not having come forward for any further offence, he having been of good behaviour during the intervening period, that further supervision is not necessary, the only terms that I will impose will be that he be of good behaviour for the duration of the good behaviour bond and that he notify the Director of Public Prosecutions of any change in address. I will direct that he be released from custody upon entering into that bond. 
    45   Noting the concurrence of both counsel to this effect, sentence will expire on 26 April 2002 which, whether precisely arithmetically accurate or not, should be taken as taking into account the periods the offender has informed me he has spent in custody and the periods he has spent in court in custody. 
    46   Fabrizio Calderoni, for the crime of robbery in company to which you have pleaded guilty and for which you have been convicted I sentence you to imprisonment until 26 April 2002. I suspend the execution of the whole of that sentence and direct you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for the whole term of that sentence upon conditions that you be, for the entire term of the bond, of good behaviour and notify the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions of any change in your address. 
    47   In the event that you breach that bond you may be returned to New South Wales and dealt with for it. Section 99 of the Act provides that the good behaviour bond might be revoked and in that case you may be returned to custody in respect of the sentence passed upon you which custody may be full-time or by way of periodic detention or home detention.  
    48   I am required to explain that to you by reason of s.96 of the Act. 
    49   In the event that you do not enter into the good behaviour bond you will go into custody and serve that sentence.

     REGINA v. RODNEY HOLLIER 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   SPIGELMAN, CJ: I will ask Greg James, J. to deliver the first judgment. 
    2   GREG JAMES, J: This appeal has been brought from the appellant's conviction on one count of maliciously wounding John Robert Bowry on 9 September 1997 at Charmhaven in the State of New South Wales. He had been charged with a co-accused, Frank Ingenhoff, that he had maliciously wounded the victim on that occasion with intent to do grievous bodily harm and also that he, on that occasion and at that place, did possess a shortened firearm, he not having been authorised to do so by a permit. 
    3   To those charges both he and the co-accused had pleaded not guilty. The jury verdict of guilty was only on the statutory alternative to the charge of maliciously wounding with intent as expressed in the indictment. The jury acquitted the appellant of the firearm offence. 
    4   The Crown case may be summarised as follows. The appellant and Ingenhoff went to the home of the victim in order to discuss, so it was said, money asserted to be owed by the victim to the appellant. A verbal altercation occurred between the appellant and the victim. The appellant moved away from or behind Ingenhoff and at about that time Ingenhoff produced the shortened firearm, and shot the victim in the upper right thigh. The appellant left the scene. Ingenhoff and the victim struggled over the gun and Ingenhoff struck the victim with the gun breaking his scapula. In the struggle the gun again discharged. Ingenhoff remained at the scene, was arrested and asserted he had not fired the shot which injured the victim. 
    5   On the arrest of the applicant he asserted he had not fired the shot but Ingenhoff had. 
    6   This summary makes clear the potential for, at trial, the two accused to blame each other. In their evidence they did just that, each seeking to avoid liability. 
    7   It was the Crown case, however, that Ingenhoff had taken the gun with him to the scene and that the appellant accompanied him, at least aware that the gun would be taken for the purpose of either extorting payment of the debt or in some manner threatening the victim, if necessary. 
    8   There was evidence of an earlier confrontation between the appellant and the victim in which the victim had made threats to the appellant. This evidence was prayed in aid as supporting the proposition that the victim was aware of the necessity to have protection at least should he wish to confront the victim and as contrary to the Ingenhoff account that his function was merely to drive the appellant to the scene. It was the Crown case that the appellant and Ingenhoff went there with the intention to resort to violence, if necessary, in self-defence or otherwise, for the purpose for which they attended the premises. 
    9   The victim, Mr. Bowry, described the confrontation and identified Ingenhoff as the person who said to him, ""Do you want to have a go at me?"" and produced a weapon from behind his back and fired it ""straight at me"". He referred to Ingenhoff coming towards him with the gun raised and the barrel pointed upwards. 
    10   Except for the reference to the appellant moving aside or behind Ingenhoff shortly prior to Ingenhoff producing the gun, the victim gives no evidence of any explicit act of encouragement at the scene by the appellant of Ingenhoff's use of the gun. It was in that context that his Honour came to direct the jury concerning the ways in which the Crown case, that the appellant was complicitous with Ingenhoff in the wounding and in the possession of the firearm, was presented. 
    11   The first of the ground of appeal starkly raise the problem presented by the jury's guilty verdict which, whilst explicable as a merciful verdict in the reduction of the charge from one of malicious wounding with intent to malicious wounding simplicitor is not so susceptible of explanation insofar as the acquittal on the charge of possession of the firearm is concerned. 
    12   The other ground asserted is that the jury should have been discharged in consequence of a remark made in evidence revealing that the appellant was attending a parole officer and, therefore, putting his bad character before the jury.  
    13   It is convenient to deal with the second of those grounds first.  
    14   The relevant passage occurred in the cross-examination of the victim by counsel for the appellant and the question, ""you certainly did not do anything about reporting his visit to the police"" elicited the response, ""I came very close to reporting him to his parole officer - oh shit"".  
    15   In the absence of the jury, discussion ensued concerning the effect on the jury of the inadvertent revelation. Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant informed the trial judge that there was no application (presumably for discharge) at this point in time and sought to consider his position at the completion of the victim's evidence. His Honour said that counsel should consider it ""now"" and expressed the view that it might not be appropriate to delay the application until the conclusion of the evidence. He was then informed that no application was made and I note no application was made at the conclusion of the evidence. 
    16   It has been submitted that the trial miscarried, that evidence was put before the jury which necessarily disclosed a prior criminal conviction and, therefore, bad character and that nothing was said or done to eradicate from the trial the impression, so it is submitted, that would have been gained by the jury.  
    17   It is further submitted that it is necessary for the trial judge, in the exercise of his duty to ensure a fair trial, to have taken appropriate steps to deal with the matter expressly or to discharge the jury and that the trial judge failed in this respect. 
    18   I am of the view that this ground cannot be upheld. In a criminal trial frequently, and unfortunately, matters which perhaps are much better not referred to do come forward. Sometimes they require the express direction of the trial judge in order to obviate the risk of potential harm. This is, however, a matter entirely within the discretion of the trial judge, familiar as he is with the circumstances, and it is not an invariable rule that where such evidence is inappropriately given the jury must be discharged: see Maric v. The Queen (1978) 52 ALJR 631 at 634.  
    19   Although the courts go to great lengths to ensure that such evidence is not placed before a jury except in unusual and peculiar circumstances the fact that it has been does not, of necessity, mean that the jury must be discharged. In this case it was obviously a matter for consideration by both the trial judge and the appellant's counsel as to whether any steps should be taken. Not only was the application for discharge disclaimed by counsel but no request was made for any express direction. The closing words of what the witness said must have drawn to the jury's attention at least that whatever he had previously said was some sort of error. One should not assume the jury would have been adversely affected, particularly where trial counsel does not apparently perceive any problem requiring any corrective. 
    20   It cannot, in my view, be the case that one should conclude the jury verdict was so tainted by what occurred or that the risk that the verdict would have been so tainted was so high that this count could be said to be made out.  
    21   This ground should be rejected. 
    22   Turning to the second ground asserted, that is, that the verdicts showed a practical inconsistency such that they could not rationally stand together in consequence of the way in which the case was conducted and the way in which his Honour summed up, the relevant tests in this regard have been expressed by the High Court recently in Mackenzie v. The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348.  
    23   This is not a case of any technical inconsistency between verdicts such as would leave the formal record of proceedings impugned. What is asserted here is that in the practical context of the case the verdicts reflect some such inconsistency so that the verdict of guilty was unsafe and unsatisfactory: see Regina v. Nanette (1981) A. Crim. R. 368. Some such inconsistency may arise, for example, by reason of an impermissible compromise between jurors as to the results on differing charges: see Regina v. Shane Hauke, (CCA, unreported 27 March 1995) and Regina v. Robinson [2000] NSWCCA 59. 
    24   In each case it is necessary to ask the question, ""whether looking at the whole of the evidence given at the trial and the judge's summing-up any reasonable explanation appears as to why the jury might have found the verdict of guilty, notwithstanding verdicts of not guilty on the other counts"": Regina v. Watson (CCA, unreported, 17 October 1990). 
    25   The test to be applied in consequence of the decision in Mackenzie (supra) by the High Court, in my view, requires an appeal court to ascertain whether or not it can see a practical and rational explanation for the different verdicts such as would enable them to stand together. Such practical, rational explanation might include the merciful verdict to which the High Court referred in Mackenzie (supra). 
    26   In the present case his Honour gave directions as to the nature of the Crown case against the man who did not have the gun. His directions as to possession in the summing-up commence at p.9 and are as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""Now the charge is against each accused that they did possess it. Now one of them certainly had it in his possession. Possession merely means having in their, for the purpose of this trial, physical custody. So whoever did have it in their possession, members of the jury, you might say well they had the possession. As to whether the other person who did not have the physical possession of it was in possession is a matter which I will have to come to a little later on and give you certain specific directions.  
       For example, if both men went there for the purpose of shooting Mr. Bowry, only one of course had the gun, but the other person knew about it, if you were so satisfied of that well therefore he could be said to also be in possession of it because it was being taken there for a specific purpose. 
        So that is the question of possession, but I will have to give you some further directions on that a little later on. 
       
      
      
       
       So the second part of that charge is he not having been authorised to do so by a permit. Tendered in evidence were two documents. I cannot remember the exhibit number, does not matter much, you have seen them, which says that neither Mr. Hollier or Mr. Ingenhoff had been authorised to be in possession of such a shortened weapon. So that is not, it is not disputed and neither accused claim that they do have such a permit. Each of the accused claims that he did not have possession of the weapon. That the weapon was in possession of the other. Now the Crown has to satisfy you that one of them had the weapon and perhaps it is up to you, you will have to maybe decide that particular question beyond reasonable doubt  
       and to make the other person then liable for that possession you would have to show that he was aware of it and it was taken there for the purpose of committing a criminal act. 
       "" 
       
      
    27   His Honour also went on to direct the jury, at p.11:- 
     
      
       
       ""Members of the jury obviously only one of the two accused could have fired the shot and as I have already said it is the Crown case it was Mr. Ingenhoff, but  
       what the Crown was putting in relation to each of the accused, perhaps at this stage irrespective of who fired the shot, assuming that one of them did, that the other person was responsible as well. The law is that where two or more persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise, each is responsible for the act or acts of the others in carrying out that enterprise. The Crown must establish both the existence of that joint criminal enterprise and the participation in it by the accused. 
       
      
      
       
       Now a joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more people reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be expressed and its existence may be inferred from all the circumstances. It need not have been reached at any particular time before a crime is committed. The circumstances in which two or more persons may participate or are participating together in the commission of a particular crime may themselves establish an unspoken understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them, then and there to commit that crime. 
       "" (emphasis added) 
       
      
    28   At various other portions of the summing-up his Honour referred to the concepts which would enable complicity to be established.  
    29   At p.13 he referred to the liability of a party who had been proved to be party to an enterprise and contemplated another crime as a possible incident in the execution of the agreed crime. In this case his Honour referred to an agreed crime to assault.  
    30   His Honour, in discussing the common purpose concept, went on to direct the jury:- 
     
      
       
       ""Members of the jury  
       what the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt is that the person who did not fire the shot was aware that there was a gun present and in these circumstances I think the Crown would have to go even further and have to prove that they were aware that the gun was agreement that a gun would be presented, but the agreement - there is no evidence to this in this case, but the agreement was that the gun would not be loaded and unknown to one of the others that person, one of the persons then did load the gun, it cannot be said that would make the other person liable because he was never any part of the joint enterprise or the arrangement that the gun would be loaded. 
       
      
      
       
       The Crown has to prove to you beyond reasonable doubt that the person who did not fire the shot was aware that the other had the gun and was aware that it was loaded. 
       "" (emphasis added) 
       
      
    31   The direction continues to p.15:- 
     
      
       
       ""That is what the Crown has to prove and the Crown sets about proving that aspect by saying well look at all the circumstances."" 
       
      
    32   Later, when dealing with the defence case, his Honour directed the jury that, ""... it is the Crown case and it always has been the Crown case that Mr. Ingenhoff had possession of the weapon ..."" and that Mr. Hollier could only be found guilty of the possession charge if the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he knew that Mr. Ingenhoff had the weapon. His Honour continued:- 
     
      
       
       ""In this case there would be no need for him to know that it was loaded,  
       but at least the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr. Hollier knew that the accused Ingenhoff had the weapon in his possession. 
       "" (emphasis added) 
       
      
    33   It has to be said that the directions, considered as a whole, and particularly with reference to the passages underlined do tend to give the jury a rather confusing picture of the essential requirements for complicity, joint enterprise and common purpose. But when considering the summing-up as a whole and considering it from the point of view of the way in which the Crown had presented its case, it seems clear enough that it was the Crown case (and the trial judge's directions reflected this) that Mr. Ingenhoff had taken with him, for the purpose of confronting the victim, the gun, and that the appellant to be guilty of the charge of possession had, at least, to know prior to arrival on the victim's doorstep that Mr. Ingenhoff had the gun with him. Further, for the appellant to be guilty of either of the malicious wounding offences, ie., the charge in the indictment or the statutory alternative, it was necessary that he be party to the shooting of the victim by Mr. Ingenhoff and in that regard at least be party to a joint design which contemplated, or party to a joint design in which he contemplated the use of the gun. This required him to know of the presence of the gun prior to arriving on the doorstep. This, it was sought to establish the basis that it had been brought to the scene as part of or incidental to the common design to obtain payment of the debt. 
    34   In those circumstances it has been submitted by the appellant that the verdict of guilty of malicious wounding cannot stand in consequence of the acquittal on the charge of possession. The appellant was only ever charged with possession on the basis of his complicity with Mr. Ingenhoff having the weapon and it is submitted that the jury's verdict of not guilty is logically inconsistent and inconsistent in a way not practically nor rationally explicable by the way in which the case was conducted and on the trial judge's directions. 
    35   In response it has been submitted on behalf of the Crown that applying the true test of complicity it was theoretically possible that the jury convicted the appellant upon the basis he was culpable either because of complicity or because he was the actual shooter.  
    36   As to the second of those alternatives, that was never the way the Crown put its case at the trial. If there had been a verdict on that basis, in my opinion, it would not have been supported by the evidence and would have been such as to have attracted intervention by this court. 
    37   It has also been submitted that in the way in which certain of his Honour's directions would have been received by the jury, although it is conceded that the summing-up in part was confusing, nonetheless, left open to the jury to find a verdict which reflected doubt as to which of the men had the gun, thus leaving the jury unable to decide in favour of the Crown on the possession count but still satisfied sufficiently of complicity by reason of knowledge of the presence of the gun so that at least on the common purpose basis complicity might be made out to the malicious wounding verdict found by the jury. 
    38   In my view, in the way in which this trial proceeded and on the summing-up of his Honour, that argument is, at the least, artificial. I do not consider it to be a rational explanation of the two verdicts such as would afford a basis for them to stand together as the trial was conducted. 
    39   I would, therefore, conclude that the first ground of appeal is made out. 
    40   The question then arises as to what course this court should take. I have not concluded that there is such legal inconsistency between the verdicts as was referred to in Mackenzie (supra) and as would show an inconsistent record in this court. It may be that at a new trial questions of substantial difficulty might arise as to what evidence might be admitted and what direction might be given to the jury to avoid the canvassing of the acquittal and in that regard it may be that attention will have to be given to the principles referred to in the High Court's decisions in Garrett v. The Queen (1978) 139 CLR 437; Storey v. The Queen (1978) 140 CLR 364 and Rogers v. The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 251. 
    41   However, it does not seem to me that the fact that a new trial might present complex or difficult questions is a matter which should, in the light of a verdict which, to an extent, when considered on its own, is explicable, be such as to stand in the way of an exercise of discretion in favour of the Director. It may be that having regard to these matters and having regard to the complex questions of presentation such a trial might involve, the Director might consider his position but that is purely a matter for him as the order made by this court in respect of a new trial is not mandatory but facultative. 
    42   In my view, it is not necessary to deal with the appeal against sentence. I would propose that the appeal be upheld, the conviction quashed and a new trial ordered.  
    43   I note also that there was an application for extension of time. Although no argument has been heard in respect of that application, it appears that it is made in consequence of the applicant having lodged the notice of appeal only a short while outside the time provided and he asserts that arose because of the circumstances in which he was detained in custody. I consider the appeal has merit. I would propose that the extension be granted.  
    44   SPIGELMAN, CJ: I agree. 
    45   NEWMAN, J: I also agree. 
    46   SPIGELMAN, CJ: The orders are as indicated by Greg James, J.

     1     
     GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Howie DCJ in the Sydney District Court. 
      
       
      
     2     
     Two indictments were before his Honour. In order to record a matter which has been clarified as a result of investigation, it is appropriate to state some circumstances concerning what is called the first indictment. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The applicant appeared before the Tamworth District Court then presided over by Coleman DCJ on 12 August 1996. Upon that occasion there was apparently prepared and signed by the Crown Prosecutor in attendance an indictment charging the applicant with the aggravated form of offence pursuant to s97(2) of the Crimes Act. However, the Crown Prosecutor amended the indictment to read in terms of a charge under s97(1) of that Act. No plea was taken on that occasion and it appears that the indictment was not presented. 
      
       
      
     4     
     On 1 June 1998 the applicant appeared again before the Tamworth District Court, on this occasion presided over by Ducker DCJ. An indictment was presented charging the applicant with an offence contrary to s97(2) of the Crimes Act, that is the aggravated form of armed robbery. To that indictment the applicant pleaded guilty. 
      
       
      
     5     
     The reason that some record should be made is that in preparation for this hearing the applicant sought access to documentary records and it appears that, in error, a copy of the indictment of 12 August, amended in the fashion I have indicated, was sent to him. It should be noted that the applicant is appearing for himself in these proceedings and it is hardly surprising therefore that he concluded that it was erroneous to suggest that he had pleaded guilty to the aggravated form of armed robbery. 
      
       
      
     6     
     The circumstances which I have delineated show that indeed the applicant did plead guilty to an offence contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act and it was in respect of such an offence that Howie DCJ dealt with him as his remarks on sentence make clear. Therefore, no error occurred of the nature suggested, namely that his Honour mistakenly believed that the applicant was to be dealt with for the aggravated form of armed robbery rather than the lesser form. 
      
       
      
     7     
     It is fair to note that no fault should be attributed to the applicant for advancing this matter as his position was no doubt confused by the dispatch to him of the unpresented but amended indictment. I can pass, therefore, from the submission advanced on his behalf that there was an error in dealing with him for an offence of aggravated armed robbery. 
      
       
      
     8     
     That offence occurred in Tamworth on 13 February 1996. At the time of the offence there was current a recognisance granted to the applicant to be of good behaviour for a specified period of time. That recognisance was not in respect of an offence like armed robbery nevertheless he was on conditional liberty to be of good behaviour and it is an aggravating circumstance of the offence that it was so committed. 
      
       
      
     9     
     The second indictment charged two offences contrary to s97(1) of the Crimes Act, shortly able to be described as armed robbery of an unaggravated kind. Those offences occurred respectively on 17 April 1998 and 20 April 1998. When each of those offences occurred the applicant was on bail in respect of the matter charged on the first indictment. Again it is an aggravating circumstance that the applicant was on bail when he committed those offences. 
      
       
      
     10     
     As I have indicated the applicant pleaded guilty to all the charges on the indictments. On the first indictment the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of two years and three months penal servitude to commence on 23 April 1998, and on the second indictment in respect of both counts to concurrent minimum terms of two years and six months commencing at the expiry of the fixed term in respect of the first indictment together with an additional term during which the applicant will be considered eligible for release on parole. It should be noted that his Honour took into account a period of nine months previous custody. 
      
       
      
     11     
     The arguments advanced by the applicant other than that to which I have already made reference, were set out in his written submissions. In the circumstances I can deal with them in relatively brief form. 
      
       
      
     12     
     He has submitted that whilst at the time he dispatched his response to the Registrar he had been in protection that that had now altered to strict protection. That is an occurrence subsequent to the imposition of sentence and in any event is not a matter which would provoke the exercise of the powers of this Court. 
      
       
      
     13     
     The applicant had his attention drawn to the guideline judgment in  
     R v Henry 
      (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. He points out, as is common ground, that that judgment was not handed down until after he was dealt with and accordingly those guidelines were not taken into account. 
      
       
      
     14     
     The applicant has challenged the assertion by the Crown that that case demonstrated that previous sentencing practice demonstrated systematic leniency and he has contended that there was in fact systematic error in what one might describe as the other direction. 
      
       
      
     15     
     It suffices to observe that the sentencing guidelines are relevant to all offences and what was found in that case was that there had been some systematic leniency. The issue for this Court is whether or not there is error in the sentence actually imposed and from the point of view of plain assessment I am unpersuaded that this is so. I would regard the sentences imposed as well within the range of his Honour's exercise of sentencing discretion from any point of view. 
      
       
      
     16     
     The applicant has drawn attention to his entitlement to consideration along the lines of those factors discussed in cases such as  
     R v Cartwright 
      and  
     R v Gallagher 
     . It is not a matter of any present confidentiality that he has offered to give evidence in relation to charges to be preferred against his wife for her participation in one of the offences. When I refer to his wife, I refer to a relationship which is obviously no longer current. 
      
       
      
     17     
     Although the applicant has submitted that he received insufficient consideration for this matter, his Honour's remarks on sentence demonstrate that they were appropriately taken into account. 
      
       
      
     18     
     The next matter adverted to by the applicant refers to what in effect was his Honour's concentration, as he submitted, upon the objective circumstances of the offences rather than looking at the reasons for it, which can be detected in the opinions of Dr White, a psychiatrist, whose report and material was before his Honour. 
      
       
      
     19     
     Mr Steer pointed out that he wished to contend that his Honour failed to understand the mental anguish which he was suffering and rather came to the conclusion that the offences were committed for the purpose of gaining money. His Honour explicitly found that the offences were provoked by greed; in that finding I am unable to detect error. 
      
       
      
     20     
     It is true, as the applicant has said, that he was distressed to a large degree by the acquittal of an alleged offender of sexual offences against a member of his family. It is difficult to perceive how mental anguish provoked by such circumstances would lead to armed robbery. 
      
       
      
     21     
     I understand Mr Steer's contention that he was prepared to do anything for his then wife and that she wanted money from him but the nexus between the offence and these circumstances seems to me to be remote in the extreme. 
      
       
      
     22     
     Be that as it may, there is manifest no error in the way the learned sentencing judge dealt with this matter. 
      
       
      
     23     
     Reference was made to what was described as a letter of comfort which had been dispatched from the Taree Police Station. The applicant has submitted that his Honour was somehow in error in failing to disclose the dispatch of this letter. The material is with the papers, it really adds nothing to the material which was made known at the hearing and public in any event and I see nothing in this appeal that can turn upon that matter. 
      
       
      
     24     
     As was submitted by the Crown Prosecutor it is important that the minimum term reflect the criminality involved in the offences. To the extent that his Honour paid regard to the objective circumstances I would endorse his approach. Given that three separate offences were involved it seems to me that no successful challenge could be mounted against the ultimate result. 
      
       
      
     25     
     Before departing from the matter I should observe, as I have noted, that the applicant was on a recognisance at the time of the first offence and that recognisance was not granted in respect of the only offence on the applicant's record. I would comment that the applicant's record is not what one would describe in terms of what is frequently seen in this Court as a bad record, nevertheless it is sufficient in itself to deny to the applicant any particular leniency derivable therefrom. 
      
       
      
     26     
     Insofar as discounts should be given for the pleas of guilty to the offences offered by the applicant, it seems to me that his Honour properly weighed them and took them into account. 
      
       
      
     27     
     I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
      
     28     
     NEWMAN J: I agree 
      
       
      
     29     
     GROVE J: The orders of the Court will be as I proposed.

     REGINA v Robert Bruce REID 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1    NEWMAN J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by his Honour Howie DCJ at the Sydney District Court following a trial at Wollongong on 26 October 1998. 
     
      
    2    The applicant had been indicted on eight counts of receiving, those counts of receiving involved motor vehicles, and the eight counts involved in each instance separate motor vehicles. In the event the jury found the applicant guilty of seven of those counts and not guilty of the eighth. 
     
      
    3    The crime of receiving, pursuant to s 188 of the Crimes Act 1900, carries a maximum penalty of ten years penal servitude. His Honour Howie DCJ sentenced the applicant to a head sentence of six years constructed of a minimum term of four and a half years and an additional term of eighteen months. 
     
      
    4    The objective facts of the matter as found by his Honour involved the applicant carrying on a business on his property on the outskirts of Goulburn of receiving stolen vehicles and re-selling those vehicles, or parts of them, after he had taken steps to disguise their identity. 
     
      
    5    The Crown case was that he had purchased wrecked or damaged vehicles so that he could use their identification plates on stolen vehicles. That involved, of course, processes such as re-stamping of identification plates; it involved the preparation of fraudulent receipts and other documents relating to the vehicles that he had purchased. In other words, the applicant was convicted of carrying out a considerable criminal enterprise. 
     
      
    6    It should be said at once that this Court has in the past indicated that those who are convicted of receiving should expect to receive condign punishment. The old adage, that without receivers there would be few thieves, has received support in this Court. 
     
      
    7    In R v Phillips, unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 11 December 1991 Lee AJ, with whom Gleeson CJ and Clarke JA agreed, observed: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The matter of receiving is one which is always accompanied by a strong element of deterrence in punishment. Receiving is regarded by the legislature as more serious than the ordinary class of larceny. A penalty of penal servitude for ten years is provided in the case of receiving; five years in the case of larceny. The purpose, of course, behind that policy is that if the receivers are prevented from performing their unlawful acts, larceny, it is thought will thereby be discouraged."" 
        
       
      
    8    As I have said the objective facts here indicate that the applicant, in relation to the seven counts of which he was convicted, was carrying on a considerable criminal enterprise of receiving. This was certainly no one-off situation. 
     
      
    9    Before his Honour were placed a number of subjective circumstances. The principal being the applicant's health. The applicant in fact gave evidence that he had been suffering at the time he gave evidence from osteoarthritis in just about every joint in his body, was on medication for that condition; he also suffered from asthma and bronchitis. A certificate was tendered before his Honour from a Dr Harmon, general practitioner, of Goulburn in which the applicant's complaints, to which he had deposed before his Honour, were confirmed. I should have added that he also suffers from the ophthalmic condition of glaucoma. 
     
      
    10    His Honour adverted to the matter of the applicant's health in his remarks on sentence. He also adverted to the ill health suffered by the applicant's present wife, she having suffered from pulmonary conditions, namely a heart condition, and had a stroke. 
     
      
    11    The thrust of the argument presented both in written submissions and in oral argument before this Court this morning was that his Honour erred in not giving sufficient weight to the applicant's health problems, nor to the fact that the applicant had not been to prison before. A further factor raised in aid was the delay which had occurred in bringing the matters before the court which had ultimately resulted in a substantial change of attitude on behalf of the applicant. 
     
      
    12    It should be noted that his Honour when dealing with the applicant's past criminal record which, while in terms of criminal records which are presented before the courts of this State daily, is not of great significance, his Honour took into account that there had been no dishonesty offences since 1992 and that the assault matters which occurred in the applicant's record were not of significance. 
     
      
    13    In my view his Honour properly recorded the applicant's past history when passing sentence and fell into no error. He also took into account the applicant's health in passing sentence. The subject of the applicant's health was raised particularly in relation to his Honour's specific finding that he could not find special circumstances in the present case. I shall advert to that submission later in my reasons. 
     
      
    14    The delay did not result in the applicant being incarcerated until he had been convicted by the jury on 7 August 1998. He had been arrested on 28 June 1995 then released on bail on the same day. In other words the delay which occurred had no onerous effect upon the applicant in terms of incarceration and while the fact that he pleaded not guilty cannot reflect in any way on any increase in sentence, it is an explanation of delay because of the condition of the lists in Wollongong at the time. In my view no error has been indicated on his Honour's part in relation to the question of delay. 
     
      
    15    I then turn to the question of special circumstances. As I have said his Honour having turned his mind to the question of circumstances found that there was none to justify altering the statutory ratio between the minimum and additional terms as set by the Sentencing Act as it then stood. 
     
      
    16    His Honour indicated that he had no admission by the applicant of why he committed the offences; his Honour knew nothing about the circumstances which had led the applicant to commit them. His Honour in fact found that the only conclusion he could come to was that the crimes were committed as a matter simply of greed. 
     
      
    17    In turning his mind to the question of special circumstances his Honour could find nothing which would require a longer additional term than otherwise required by the Sentencing Act, as it then stood, for the rehabilitation of the applicant. 
     
      
    18    While the category of subjective features which might give rise to a finding of special circumstances is perhaps impossible to categorise precisely, it is the fact that rehabilitation of a person convicted is a matter which the courts have concentrated upon in the past in dealing with special circumstances. See what fell from this Court in R v Phelan (1993) 66 A Crim R 446 at 449. 
     
      
    19    It was submitted, as I have indicated earlier, that the applicant's health was a matter which should have led his Honour to find special circumstances, accordingly in so doing his Honour fell into error. His Honour did take into account the applicant's health when setting the sentence. 
     
      
    20    It seems to me that in the absence of any other matters his Honour, having considered the matter of special circumstances and having taken into account the applicant's condition of health and also his wife's, in determining the head sentence did not fall into error in further taking the matters into account in determining the ratio between the minimum term and the additional sentences. 
     
      
    21    It was conceded that while it was submitted that the sentence was at the top of the range, it was not without the range of sentences available for the crimes in question. 
     
      
    22    In my view no error has been demonstrated in his Honour's approach to sentence, nor having regard to the nature of the offences, that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    23    Accordingly, it follows that I am of the view that the applicant cannot succeed. Because of the seriousness of the matter and having regard to the applicant's age, he is now in his 50s, I would grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    24    GROVE J: I agree. The orders of the Court, therefore, will be as proposed by Newman J.

     1     
     GROVE J : 
       
      This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Grogan DCJ in the District Court in Parramatta on 26 February 1999. On that occasion, the applicant was sentenced in respect of an offence that on 22 August 1984 at Dulwich Hill he supplied a quantity of the drug commonly referred to as heroin. 
      
       
      
     2     
     His Honour took into account on a Form 1 under the Criminal Procedure Act, five further offences of supply of that drug. The sentence imposed by his Honour was a minimum term of imprisonment of two years and six months with an additional term of one year. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The plea of guilty offered by the applicant to the indicted charge was offered after a voir dire hearing which had extended over the previous days. The plea was, in fact, offered on 11 November 1998. 
      
       
      
     4     
     It should be observed that the delay arose out of the circumstance that the applicant had, after being charged, absconded from Australia. He returned to Australia voluntarily many years later. 
      
       
      
     5     
     This application is centrally based upon an assertion that the applicant can have a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the sentence which he received from Grogan DCJ when compared with that imposed upon a co-offender Zeki Oygur, who was dealt with by Madgwick DCJ (as he then was) on 17 December 1987.  
      
       
      
     6     
     The principles to be applied where an argument asserting disparity is raised are not in doubt. What needs to be demonstrated by the person complaining on the grounds of parity is not that he feels aggrieved but that a reasonable man looking overall at what has happened will see that the offender's grievance is justified. See  
     R v Doggett 
      CCA 24 March 1997 per Sully and Newman JJ. 
      
       
      
     7     
     At the time that the applicant appeared for sentence before Grogan DCJ the remarks of Madgwick DCJ made in connection with the sentencing of Oygur as long ago as 1987 were not available. They have since become available and it has been common ground that they may be referred to in this hearing. 
      
       
      
     8     
     The initial question to be determined is whether or not sentences imposed on the co-offender were in fact matters which can be used for genuine comparison and subsidiary to that whether therefore, they can give rise to a sense of grievance which is justifiable. It is necessary to look at the proceedings in the earlier case. 
      
       
      
     9     
     Oygur appeared for sentence before Madgwick DCJ not only in respect of an offence of supplying heroin which was co-ordinate with the offence of the present applicant, but also in respect of a conspiracy to import a drug into this country. That charge was brought against Oygur pursuant to Commonwealth legislation. The prisoner Oygur had pleaded not guilty to what might conveniently be described as the State offence but was convicted, and he pleaded guilty to the matter charged under Federal legislation. 
      
       
      
     10     
     His Honour's remarks show that he was concerned with the overlap of jurisdiction. When he came to sentence Oygur in respect of the State matter he made this remark: 
      
       
        
         
          
         ""I would think that something like for the State crime a three years head sentence with a fifteen months non probation period would be appropriate."" 
         
        
       
       
        
       He also indicated that he had in mind something in the order of a twelve year sentence with a six year non parole period for the federal offence. 
        
       
      
     11     
     The prisoner Oygur had been in custody for a period of time and pre sentence custody had to be taken into account. In the event, although his Honour observed that the two offences needed to be dealt with cumulatively, he imposed sentences which were wholly concurrent and, in fact, he actually imposed a sentence for the State offence of three years with a fifteen months non probation period.  
      
       
      
     12     
     I should interpolate that that sentence was imposed prior to the Sentencing Act 1989. That Act itself has also since been repealed and replaced. Nevertheless, it accords with principle that remissions which were available to prisoners sentenced prior to its operation should exceptionally be taken into account where a matter of parity was raised between offenders who were sentenced, one prior to the operation of that Act and one subsequently. Hence, it can be perceived that a sentence of three years with fifteen months non probation period might, in reality, be regarded as keeping an offender in custody for a period something less than the specified non parole period. 
      
       
      
     13     
     The situation with the applicant is quite different in the sense that he, being sentenced pursuant to the now repealed Sentencing Act 1989 will serve the entirety of the minimum term of the component of the sentence imposed by Grogan DCJ. 
      
       
      
     14     
     I return, however, to the proceedings before Madgwick DCJ. Having to deal with the manifestly more serious matter of the conspiracy to import, he finally imposed a sentence of thirteen years four months and nineteen days with a minimum term (non-parole) component of seven years four months and nineteen days. That somewhat apparently irregular sentence was imposed to commence from the date upon which Oygur had been taken into custody and was intended to reflect the general view as to sentence for the Commonwealth offence which his Honour had specified but was also intended to comprehend the criminality for the State offence. This his Honour sought to specify with his final remark which I quote: 
      
       
        
         
         ""I hope it is clear by now that the actual form of the sentences have been chosen with a view to punishing for the entirety of the criminality involved in relation to the two crimes of which the prisoner is convicted"". 
         
        
        
       Therefore, it needs to be said that although there was an actual sentence imposed in respect of the State offence, its actual quantification involved a certain amount of the hypothetical bearing in mind that what his Honour finally decided to do was to impose an overall sentence in respect of two matters being dealt with concurrently. 
        
       
      
     15     
     I turn then to some matters which are relevant to the general notion of comparison. It was said that Oygur had been higher in what was described as a ""drug dealing pyramid"" than the applicant. It appears that the evidence before Grogan DCJ persuaded him that Oygur had been the supplier to the applicant and the applicant in turn had been a supplier to customers of his. No challenge was offered to his Honour's finding to that effect. 
      
       
      
     16     
     The effect of his Honour's overall findings was to demonstrate that plainly the applicant was involved in commercial dealing in drugs. If any doubt were to be expressed about that, it would be set aside by the five matters which the applicant asked to be taken into account on the Form 1. Two of the supplies of heroin had, in fact, agreed prior to the offence on the indictment but significantly, in my view, three further offences had occurred after the indicted offence but whilst the applicant was on bail in respect of them. That is an aggravating feature to his offence which is not present in the offence of Oygur, with which it is sought to draw a comparison. 
      
       
      
     17     
     Reference is made to the comparatively poor record of Oygur as against the applicant's absence of prior conviction. That is a matter which obviously must be taken into account in favour of the applicant. Attention is also drawn to the difference in circumstance of Oygur and the applicant in that Oygur went to trial, whereas ultimately the applicant pleaded guilty. I would observe that the plea of guilty came very late in the day, and I am referring to the conduct of the voir dire hearing and the plea of not guilty which was maintained up until after the completion of that hearing, and not to the long period of years in which the applicant, as a result of his absconding, was outside of the country. 
      
       
      
     18     
     I have taken time to describe some of the facets of dealing with these separate offences to demonstrate that, in my view, the sentences imposed on each of the offenders do not manifest a sufficient basis for comparison in order to sustain the argument of disparity. As I have said, Oygur received a sentence which was subsumed in a much longer sentence, and it would be artificial, in my view, to extrapolate the actual sentence in respect of this particular offence imposed upon Oygur and regard that as an appropriate yardstick for comparison. It was, as I have observed, entirely subsumed within another sentence. 
      
       
      
     19     
     What remains, therefore, is to determine whether or not the sentence imposed by Grogan DCJ was in any way excessive or otherwise inappropriate. It has not been shown that his Honour made any error in factual determination and, in my view, the imposition upon the applicant was within the range of the sound exercise of his Honour's sentencing discretion. The applicant was shown to be, as I have commented, a commercial dealer who was, noting the matters on schedule, given to repeat offending even when his liberty was conditional on bail. I propose the applicant have leave to appeal, that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
      
     20     
     NEWMAN J: I agree. 
      
       
      
     21     
     GROVE J: The orders of the Court, therefore, will be as I proposed.

     REGINA v Steven Joseph MITCHELL 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1    NEWMAN J: This is an appeal against the conviction of the appellant of three charges in the District court. On 4 March 1999, following a trial which commenced on 1 March 1999, a jury of eleven convicted the appellant on the following charges: 
     
      
       
      1. The appellant on 10 April 1998 at Carrington did detain the victim with intent to hold the victim for advantage of himself. 
       
       
      2. The appellant on 10 April 1998 at Carrington did have sexual intercourse with the victim without the consent of the victim knowing that the victim was not consenting. 
       
       
      3. The appellant on 10 April 1998 at Carrington did assault the victim. 
       
      
    2    At the trial an order was made for non publication of the complainant’s name and in my view that order should continue in respect of these proceedings. 
     
      
    3    At the trial it was the Crown case that the events which occurred giving rise to the charges followed an encounter between the appellant and his alleged victim in Maitland Road at Islington in the Newcastle suburban area. The complainant, working as a prostitute at the time, commenced her activities on the evening of Thursday, 9 April 1998. 
     
      
    4    Her evidence at trial was some time between 11 pm and 1.30 am she encountered a person who had driven up beside her in a station wagon which was red in colour with a black or silver stripe down its side. 
     
      
    5    A discussion ensued in which it was agreed between the assailant and the victim that a sexual encounter would take place for a certain price. 
     
      
    6    The complainant described the person driving the vehicle as being in his mid twenties with dark hair and unshaven. He was a bit drunk. He was thick set and about five feet ten inches in height. She described the interior of the vehicle as having upholstery of a light tan/cream colour. 
     
      
    7    The Crown case was then that the two drove to a place at Carrington in the Newcastle area which was isolated. The assailant then advised the victim that he did not have enough money and after discussion drove to Beaumont Street, Hamilton. 
     
      
    8    The victim gave evidence that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What happened after that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. We drove to an auto bank on Beaumont Street, Hamilton 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What bank was it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. There’s a couple of auto tellers where we went. I think he used the Commonwealth Bank, but I didn’t see him. I didn’t watch him use the bank.” 
        
       
      
    9    Following the visit to Beaumont Street, Hamilton the pair returned to the isolated area at Carrington and consensual sex then took place. 
     
      
    10    On the completion of what the victim believed to be a sexual engagement which had been the subject of the agreement, the assailant indicated the desire to continue. The victim declined. 
     
      
    11    A sexual encounter then took place which the victim stated was not in any way consensual. An endeavour which was subsequently made by the victim to escape resulted in her being threatened by her assailant in which attack she suffered injuries. 
     
      
    12    The assailant then blindfolded the victim, and drove her some distance away. She alighted from the vehicle still blindfolded. After the blindfold was removed she found herself in another suburban area in Newcastle at Waratah near Maitland Road. The assailant and the victim then went to a service station where one or other of them rang a taxi. The taxi picked the pair up. 
     
      
    13    In the original encounter at the time after the consensual sexual activity had ceased it was the victim’s allegation that her assailant had taken money from her. During the ride the pair had in the taxi some of that money was returned to her by her assailant.  
     
      
    14    She left the taxi, went to her brother’s house after which subsequently she was medically examined and injuries were discovered which were consistent with the attack she had described. 
     
      
    15    At the trial there was no issue that the victim had in fact been sexually attacked and assaulted in a non sexual manner. The principal issue at the trial was, was it the appellant who was the assailant. 
     
      
    16    Evidence was led at the trial that the victim had been shown a video containing some twenty photographs, one of which was the photograph of the appellant and she had not been able to make an identification from that video. 
     
      
    17    Evidence was also led that at the relevant time the appellant owned a motor vehicle which in many ways, although not precisely, matched the description of the motor vehicle given by the victim. 
     
      
    18    Evidence was led from the official of the Commonwealth Bank which indicated that at 2.31 am on the morning of 10 April 1998 a transaction was recorded at the Beaumont Street, Hamilton branch of the Commonwealth Bank, a withdrawal of $100, the sum nominated by the victim in her evidence, on a key card the number of which coincided exactly with the key card held by the appellant at the Commonwealth Bank. 
     
      
    19    It was on the description given by the victim at the trial, which description there is no issue was a reasonable description of the appellant, the evidence relating to the colour and other features of the car in question and the evidence relating to the withdrawal of $100 from the Hamilton branch of the Commonwealth Bank which constituted the basis of case founded upon circumstantial evidence brought by the Crown against the appellant. 
     
      
    20    It is plain from the narrative I have just given of the Crown case that there was no positive identification made by the victim of her assailant. 
     
      
    21    At the trial, following an opening in which the learned Crown Prosecutor had told the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “it all happened commencing in the early hours of the morning of Friday 10 April 1998. I anticipate the plaintiff’s evidence will be that at the time she was actually working in the Newcastle area as a prostitute and that she was in effect picked up by the accused for the purposes of prostitution.” 
        
       
      
    22    Shortly after the opening was completed the victim was called by the Crown. Having described the original conversation in which the question of payment for whatever services the complainant was prepared to deliver to the assailant, the following exchange occurred. The car having pulled up at the kerb: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Then what happened when that car pulled up as you said? 
        
       
       
        
        A. He asked me what my prices were and I told him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who is he, who are you referring to? 
        
       
       
        
        A. You want me to point him out or just ..” 
        
       
      
    23    There is an indication in the transcript that the prosecutor then cut the victim off: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. No, was there somebody in that car? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, there was somebody in that car.” 
        
       
      
    24    While there was no immediate application for a discharge for reasons which would seem to me to be forensically correct, counsel for the defence shortly thereafter sought to have the jury discharged on the basis that the statement made in the previous non responsive answer given by the victim to the Crown amounted to a form of dock identification. 
     
      
    25    A written submission was handed to the court, and oral argument was received from both the defence counsel and Crown Prosecutor. His Honour declined the application stating: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am satisfied that the matters set out in the Crown’s submissions to me have considerable merit. The question to the witness was capable of an interpretation ‘are you asking me to point him out’. It is a great quantum leap to then say that is evidence of a visual identification or dock identification. Bluntly, it is not a dock identification. I am not rejecting evidence of identification in court because there has been no identification in court.” 
        
       
      
    26    The submission made on behalf of the appellant this morning is not that the statement made by the victim in her evidence amounted to a dock identification but that the jury might have assumed without proper foundation that the victim could have identified the appellant in court but was prevented from so doing because of a legal technicality. 
     
      
    27    In other words what is submitted on behalf of the appellant is that a failure of his Honour to accede to the application made by counsel for the defence that the jury ought to have been discharged amounted to a situation where a fair trial could not have occurred for the reasons stated. 
     
      
    28    In R v Crofts (1996) 186 CLR 427 at 440-441 the High Court examined the question of whether an appellant court should interfere in a case where a judge had declined to refuse a discharge. Having at p 440 set out the discretionary nature of the judge’s power to discharge, at p 441 the High Court observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellant court must also decide for itself whether in those circumstances the result of the refusal to discharge the jury occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. In other words, can the appellant court say with assurance that, but for the admission of the inadmissible evidence, the conviction was inevitable.” 
        
       
      
    29    In the instant case the submission is that the victim having made the statement which she did, to allow the trial to continue in a case where there was no positive identification evidence - and it was possible from the tenor of the Crown opening to indicate that the victim could in fact identify her assailant - that to allow the trial to continue following her response constituted a basic unfairness and carried a risk that the jury may have made the assumption which I have referred to earlier in these reasons. 
     
      
    30    In my view following what had fallen from the High Court in Crofts I am of the view the jury may well have made the assumption referred to and accordingly a situation of significant unfairness has occurred and I believe that a miscarriage of justice has in fact occurred and this Court should interfere and quash the conviction. 
     
      
    31    A second ground of appeal was advanced on the basis that the convictions were unreasonable and cannot be supported. 
     
      
    32    All I wish to say on that ground is this, that in the absence of the unfair admission of the passage I have adverted to I am of the view that a jury could have convicted in terms of M v R (1994) 181 CLR 41. 
     
      
    33    Accordingly, I would not be of the view that while, as I have already said, the conviction should be quashed, I do not believe that a verdict of acquittal should be entered. I thus do not propose to go into the reasons advanced on the second ground in detail. 
     
      
    34    I am of the view that the following orders should be made: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal should be upheld. 
       
       
      2. The conviction and sentence should be quashed. 
       
       
      3. The appellant should have a new trial. 
       
       
      
    35    ADAMS J: I agree with the orders proposed by Newman J and his Honour’s reasons for them. I should point out to the Crown that it will need to consider the effect of s 409B on the evidence of the complainant. 
     
      
       
      
    36    SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with the reasons of Newman J and his Honour’s orders. The orders are as his Honour has indicated.

       REGINA v JCW 
       
       
      The Applicant was charged with four counts of sexual abuse. He pleaded guilty. He was sentenced by Gibson DCJ on 8 August 1997. The basis on which the sentences imposed were that the charges were representative of a number of similar incidents which had occurred over a period of time. The Applicant admitted this. However, the charges for Counts 3 and 4 were based on incorrect legislation. Thus, the Applicant’s conviction for those charges could not be sustained. Accordingly, the Court of Criminal Appeal had to decide what was an appropriate sentence in relation to charges 1 and 2. 
      
     
     
      
      Held 
       
       
      ( 
      per 
       Spigelman CJ, Ireland and Simpson JJ agreeing) 
       
       
      1 The practice of dealing with representative counts, does not infringe the principle that a person should not be punished for a crime for which he or she has not been convicted. There is a distinction between not increasing a penalty based on aggravation and not granting leniency on account of the fact that the events as charged were not isolated incidents.

      4 Gibson DCJ gave sufficient weight to the guilty pleas and the fact that the Applicant had been sexually abused as a child. 
      
     
     
      
      5 The sentence was not manifestly excessive. 
      
     
     
      
      6 In circumstances where grave and repeated sexual assaults are perpetrated upon a young child, in particular by a person in a position of trust and authority, condign punishment is called for.

       JUDGMENT 
        
       
       
       
        
       
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: The facts and issues are set out in the judgment of Ireland J which I have read in draft. By reason of the Crown’s concession that the conviction on counts 3 and 4 should be quashed, leave to appeal against sentence should be granted. It is necessary for this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. 
     
      
    2    I would not have interfered with the original sentence on any of the other bases: Ground 4, alleged failure to give sufficient weight to the plea of guilty; Ground 5, the sexual abuse suffered by the Applicant; Ground 6, that the sentence is manifestly excessive. I agree with Ireland J in these respects. 
     
      
    3    Grounds 2 and 3 raise an issue of broader significance. In exercising the sentencing discretion, this Court must give consideration to what if any weight it should give to the proposition that the two counts on which the convictions must stand were not isolated instances. In my opinion, if the two occasions of admitted sexual assault were isolated instances, a lower sentence would be appropriate than if the two assaults were part of a general course of conduct with respect to the daughter DW. 
     
      
    4    This Court has before it four sources of uncontested material.  
     
      
    5    First there is the guilty plea to the two counts involving SW, the sister of the relevant complainant. The circumstance that those convictions are to be quashed by reason of the fact that the prosecution was statute barred does not, of itself, necessarily affect the use of the pleas for sentencing purposes. 
     
      
    6    Secondly, by his counsel, the Applicant admitted that the two counts relating to DW were “representative” of other conduct. 
     
      
    7    Thirdly, uncontested statements by each of the sisters are before the Court. Those statements reveal a course of conduct of systematic violation of the Applicant’s two young daughters over many years. 
     
      
    8    Fourthly, a report of a psychiatrist instructed on behalf of the Applicant was tendered. The report repeats admissions by the Applicant of a sexual relationship with both daughters. 
     
      
    9    The above does not constitute an admission by the Applicant of any, let alone each, specific allegation made by his daughters. However, there was an admission of systematic violation by him of both daughters from an early age, and extending over a substantial period. The Court is, in my opinion, entitled to act on the basis of the daughters’ statements to the extent of this general admission. 
     
      
    10    No submission was made to this Court that the concession before the sentencing judge that the charges were “representative” was not based on instructions. The highest the factual case could be put was that the admissions in the record of interview were equivocal, particularly in view of the denials also contained therein. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the Applicant plainly admitted that the two counts now remaining in the indictment were part of a systematic course of abuse to which he had subjected his daughter DW. The issue is what, if any, is the scope of the permissible use of this admission for the purposes of sentencing. 
     
      
    11    Mr P Byrnes SC, who appeared for the Applicant with Ms Marty, submitted that sentencing on the basis that charges are “representative” of other conduct offends the principle that no-one be punished for offences for which there has not been a conviction, subject only to the long existing statutory regime, now found in Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, for taking into account other matters, being matters with which the person has in fact been charged. 
     
      
    12    The Applicant invoked The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383, and particularly the principle expressed at 389 in that case that “no one should be punished for an offence of which he has not been convicted”. (This principle was affirmed most recently in R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54, 73 ALJR 1550, 166 ALR 330 at [18]). 
     
      
    13    With respect to DW the Applicant’s admission established that the two counts charged were “representative” or “sample” or “specimen” counts. Mr Byrne submitted that, conformably with the principle in De Simoni, this admission could not be taken into account on sentence in any respect. 
     
      
    14    The two respects in which the admission could be taken into account are first, as a matter of aggravation leading to an increased penalty and, secondly, as a matter which rebuts the possibility of mitigation with attendant leniency. In the present case, the trial judge applied only the latter. 
     
      
    15    In his remarks on sentence, Gibson DCJ indicated the manner in which he took into account the admission by the Applicant of the broader pattern of conduct. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The pleas were entered on the basis that they were representative of the conduct of the prisoner towards the two children. It must be remembered that this does not mean that he receives more because of that but it means that he is not being treated as if they were isolated incidents.” 
        
       
      
    16    Mr Byrne submitted that the distinction between not increasing a sentence, and failing to grant leniency on account of the fact that the events as charged were not isolated incidents, should not be accepted to be a material distinction. He invoked the observations of Bray CJ in The Queen v Reiner (1974) 8 SASR 102 at 105, to the effect that this distinction “approaches the metaphysical”.  
     
      
    17    The context of the specific observation by Bray CJ indicates that his Honour, nevertheless, did accept that the distinction was a relevant and permissible one. The full passage from Reiner at 105 is: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the other hand the learned Judge was entitled to take into account the context and the surrounding circumstances of the crime and in particular it was permissible, relevant and important for him to know whether the act charged was an isolated offence or whether it was only, to use the metaphor often adopted, the tip of an iceberg. The surrounding circumstances of the crime may be taken into account in considering whether or not to extend leniency so as to reduce what would otherwise be a proper sentence but the commission of other crimes not asked to be taken into account under the procedure just mentioned cannot be used in order to increase what would otherwise be a proper sentence. As I have said on another occasion, the distinction between refraining from taking something off and adding something on when there is no fixed normal penalty may seem, in some cases, to approach the metaphysical. But it is a recognised and time honoured distinction for all that.” 
        
       
      
    18    The reference in the middle of this passage to “the procedure just mentioned” is a reference to the immediately preceding paragraph in which Bray CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the normal procedure adopted when it is desired that offences not charged should be taken into account, namely the handing up of a precise list of such offences signed by the accused, was not followed.” 
        
       
      
    19    In New South Wales this procedure is now governed by Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, for State offences, and s16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), for Commonwealth offences. 
     
      
    20    The thrust of the submission on behalf of the Applicant was that taking into account other acts which constitute offences in and of themselves, should now be confined as a matter of judicial development to these statutory procedures. 
     
      
    21    The Applicant’s submission would prohibit the use of admissions for the purposes of refusing leniency on the basis of relevant mitigating circumstances, (as Gibson DCJ expressly did in this case). 
     
      
    22    In this regard, the Applicant placed particular reliance on the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in R v D [1996] 1 Qd R 363, (reported sub nom R v Dales (1995) 80 A Crim R 50). The following passage at 404; 88 was relied on: 
     
      
       
        
        “To withhold leniency by reference to offences of which a person being sentenced has not been convicted is, in our opinion, to punish that person for those offences as surely as if additional punishment were imposed by reference to those offences. A person who has only been convicted of an isolated offence is entitled to be punished as for an isolated offence, not on the basis that the only offence of which he or she has been convicted was not isolated but part of a pattern of conduct with which he or she has not been charged and of which he or she has not been convicted.” 
        
       
      
    23    This conclusion was said to follow from an application of the principle expressed in De Simoni, and which the Queensland Court of Appeal elaborated upon in the following passage, immediately preceding the paragraph just quoted, at 403-404; (87-88): 
     
      
       
        
        “Sentencing judges ought experience little difficulty in practice if there is unqualified adherence to the fundamental principles which emerge from the decisions of the High Court in  
        De Simoni 
         and subsequent cases. We will try to summarise those principles in a manner which should be adequate for most purposes. 
        
       
       
        
        1. Subject to the qualifications which follow: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a sentencing judge should take account of all the circumstances of the offence of which the person to be sentenced has been convicted, either on a plea of guilty or after a trial, whether those circumstances increase or decrease the culpability of the offender; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) common sense and fairness determine what acts, omissions and matters constitute the offence and the attendant circumstances for sentencing purposes (cp.  
          Merriman 
           at 593,  
          R. v T.  
          at 455); and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) an act, omission, matter or circumstance within (b) which might itself technically constitute a separate offence is not, for that reason, necessarily excluded from consideration. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        2. An act, omission, matter or circumstance which it would be permissible otherwise to take into account may not be taken into account if the circumstances would then establish: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a separate offence which consisted of, or included, conduct which did not form part of the offence of which the person to be sentenced has been convicted; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a more serious offence than the offence of which the person to be sentenced has been convicted; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) a ‘circumstance of aggravation’ (Code, s.1) of which the person to be sentenced has not been convicted; i.e., a circumstance which increases the maximum penalty to which that person is exposed. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        3. An act, omission, matter or circumstance which may not be taken into account may not be considered for any purpose, either to increase the penalty or deny leniency; and this restriction is not to be circumvented by reference to considerations which are immaterial unless used to increase penalty or deny leniency, e.g., ‘context’ or the ‘relationship’ between the victim and offender, or to establish, for example, the offender’s ‘past conduct’, ‘character’, ‘reputation’, or that the offence was not an ‘isolated incident’, etc.” 
        
       
      
    24    The Queensland Court of Appeal has, subsequently, given further consideration to the propositions set out in point form in R v D.  
     
      
    25    In R v Wackerow [1988] 1 Qd R 197; (1996) 90 A Crim R 297 the Court had before it a case involving two charges of sexual assault against a young girl. During the trial the complainant gave evidence of sexual abuse on a number of other occasions. Byrne J at A Crim R 310 applied R v D and found that the trial judge had erred when “he took into account the uncharged incidents as ‘relevant’ in showing that the two offences were not ‘isolated instances’.” In the course of his judgment Pincus JA said at A Crim R 305-306: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it seems to me clear that one could not, consistently with  
        Dales, 
         take into account on sentence uncharged sexual offences whose only connection with those charged is that they show that the offences charged were not isolated instances, or show that the offender had a propensity to engage in sexual acts with the complainant. I should add that in my view the approach to this question taken by the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        Cooksley 
         [1982] Qd R 405 sub nom  
        C 
         (1982) 6 A Crim R 128, and in  
        Jobson 
         [1989] 2 Qd R 464 sub nom  
        J (Jnr) 
         (1989) 41 A Crim R 466 is irreconcilable with  
        Dales.  
        The same must be said of the principal judgment in  
        Knox 
         (unreported, Qld Ct of App, CA No 269 of 1993, 22 October 1993); see especially pp11 and 12 of the reasons of Davies JA and Thomas J. …  
        
       
       
        
        Although the primary judge disclaimed any intention of imposing sentences which included extra time for the uncharged offences … that is what he did; his Honour plainly took the uncharged offences into account and equally plainly, not by way of mitigation. … 
        
       
       
        
        Of course, a conviction of maintaining an unlawful relationship, under s229B of the Code, leads to sentencing for the maintaining of the relationship, not merely for the identified acts which the Crown must prove to satisfy the requirement in the second paragraph of s229B(1). 
        
       
       
        
        The third principle set out in  
        Dales 
         makes it clear that in the present case the uncharged incidents, not falling within an exception recognised in the stated principles, could not be ‘considered for any purpose’.” 
        
       
      
    26    Pincus JA’s reference to the particular provision in s229B of the Code is of significance, as I will show below. The charges in both D and Wackerow were under s210 - indecently dealing - not under s229B.  
     
      
    27    In R v Bettridge (Supreme Court of Queensland, Court of Appeal, 27 May 1998, unreported) Thomas J with whom McPherson and Davies JJA agreed, found that the trial judge had taken into account a “representative conduct” allegation contrary to the principles set out in R v D. However, his Honour said at 2-3: 
     
      
       
        
        “At some stage it may be necessary for this Court to revisit  
        R v D 
         (above), some points of which are arguably inconsistent with other authorities both in this Court and in other jurisdictions.” 
        
       
      
    28    The continued application of the entirety of the reasoning of R v D appears also to be questioned in the judgment of Pincus JA in R v Hile (Supreme Court of Queensland, Court of Appeal, 5 February 1999, unreported) when, at 6, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not, however, find it necessary to say any more about what I regard as the rather difficult subject of the effect of  
        De Simoni 
        , or the analysis of it in  
        D.” 
        
       
      
    29    In R v D the Court of Appeal of Queensland considered a number of authorities, including prior authorities in that State, in which a distinction of the character which it proceeded to reject, had been accepted. In the case of New South Wales, the Court of Appeal made particular reference to R v H (1980) 3 A Crim R 53 in which a distinction, similar to that already set out in the judgment of Bray CJ in Reiner, was accepted in this Court.  
     
      
    30    In R v H, Street CJ noted that admissions made by the Respondent in those proceedings in the course of a record of interview did suggest “prior sexual misconduct towards his daughter”. In this regard, Street CJ said at 59: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown is entitled to point to this as negativing such benefit as the respondent might otherwise have sought to obtain from the assertion that this was a wholly spur of the moment lapse, unprecedented by anything in any way irregular in his earlier conduct towards his daughter. But, in the light of the specific charge against him and the course of proceedings at the sentencing hearing, it is not correct to assert, as the Crown seeks to do on this appeal, that the Respondent is to be sentenced on the basis that this act of incest is the culmination of a series of similar offences and that the sentence should accordingly reflect what is said to be the criminality involved in prior acts of incest.” 
        
       
      
    31    Moffit P at 62 said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The only matter of importance is that the concession of earlier sexual interference was before his Honour. Of course, it was necessary and proper that it be, because it provided the context by which the criminal quality of the act of incest had to be judged and because, properly regarded, it ought to have led to the rejection of the claim made that it was some casual act in a moment of temptation, perhaps deliberately offered by the daughter to entrap him. 
        
       
       
        
        If punishment is to be imposed for any past act of incest, this can only be done if the accused is charged with these offences either in specific or general terms, a matter which learned Crown counsel conceded … 
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        However, the consequence of charging the respondent with the one act of incest did not require or justify his past relationship with his daughter and in particular his sexual molestation of her being ignored. What counsel for the respondent sought to do, and it seems did with some success, was to have his past conduct ignored and have the single act of incest evaluated as thought it was an isolated act. There was made an artificial case quite contrary to the truth. By ignoring the true position, the single act became the one mistake of a man who succumbed to a sudden temptation put before him by a daughter who, so it was put, may have offered the temptation deliberately to entrap him.” 
        
       
      
    32    Begg J said at 74: 
     
      
       
        
        “All the material relating to the respondent’s past history cannot be considered in isolation without forming an opinion as to what in fact existed on a sexual basis during this period of time between the respondent and his daughter. To do so is completely artificial and would give a completely false picture of the respondent from a subjective point of view. 
        
       
       
        
        It is one thing to say a man has never been guilty of any criminal act including incestuous acts upon a daughter over a long period of time and has lived an exemplary life, and another to say that this man had an external good reputation but was at the same time secretly debauching his young daughter. The former might well merit a large measure of leniency. The latter, very little. … 
        
       
       
        
        I should emphasise that subjective material is admissible purely to be weighed in considering the question as to whether or not a sentence otherwise called for by reason of the actual facts of the crime should be dealt with less severely, that is, to what extent should leniency be extended.” 
        
       
      
    33    Begg J had earlier said at 71: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is trite law that when an indictment alleges one offence only, the accused pleads guilty to that offence only and can only be sentenced in respect of that offence. That is the position here: on this indictment he can only be sentenced for the act of incest therein charged. But when the court is considering what are commonly called the subjective elements of the case, namely the antecedents and good character of the accused, the effect of the crime upon other members of the family and of the disgrace visited upon the accused when he is found out, the extent to which leniency has to be applied, can only be gauged by seeing the real relationship between the respondent and the victim.” 
        
       
      
    34    In R v Holyoak (1995) 82 A Crim R 502 Allen J, with whom Handley JA and Hulme J agreed, considered the law with respect to “representative charges”. His Honour referred to the judgment of Bray CJ in Reiner and agreed with Bray CJ that the relevant distinction did “seem to approach the metaphysical”. However, his Honour went on to say at 510: 
     
      
       
        
        “The distinction is, however, one firmly established in the cases and it is the duty of a sentencing judge to apply it.” 
        
       
      
    35    Allen J went on to refer to the decision in H and added at 511: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is to be noted that in  
        H 
         this Court considered that it was the duty of the sentencing judge to have regard, in the way indicated, to H’s admission in his record of interview of the earlier sexual activity notwithstanding that, at the sentencing hearing, his counsel stated that he denied that such earlier activity had occurred. It is implicit that  
        H 
         is authority that in sentencing for an isolated sexual offence it is the duty of the judge to receive and assess evidence of earlier acts of the same type committed by the offender upon the victim.” 
        
       
      
    36    The existence of a distinction between taking into account admissions of other sexual offences either in their own right or as a matter of aggravation, on the one hand, and, such admissions rendering unavailable matters going to mitigation on the other hand, was also accepted in the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Gleeson CJ and Hidden J agreed) in R v GWE (Supreme Court of NSW, Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 March 1997, unreported) at p17. 
     
      
    37    Furthermore, in R v H (1994) 74 A Crim R 41, Gleeson CJ with whom Mahoney JA and Sully J agreed, said at 43, in the context of a case in which the Applicant had pleaded guilty to ten sexual offences committed on his daughter and one against another young girl: 
     
      
       
        
        “In cases of this kind it is common for the offender to be charged with particular offences which are representative of a larger number of offences of a similar kind. The evidence in the present case showed that sexual offences were routinely committed by the appellant against his daughter over practically the whole of her life. The appellant acknowledged that he deliberately set out, in effect, to make his own daughter his lover. The serious psychological harm which this caused the daughter is readily understandable, and, by the time she ran away from home, her years as the object of her father’s desire for gratification had brought her to a state of serious emotional turmoil. The appellant came to be sentenced, not for his general course of conduct, but for the specific offences to which he pleaded guilty. Nevertheless, the background of conduct against which those specific offences occurred was a matter properly taken into account by the sentencing judge. These were not isolated offences.” 
        
       
      
    38    In order to adopt the reasoning in R v D, this Court would have to refuse to follow these previous decisions. There is no warrant, in my opinion, to do so. The reasoning in R v D should not be adopted. 
     
      
    39    The Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria considered the issue in R v SBL [1999] 1 VR 706. Phillips CJ made reference to R v D, Holyoak, Reiner and Godfrey (1993) 69 A Crim R 318. His Honour then referred to an earlier decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Victoria, R v Wright (Supreme Court of Victoria, Court of Criminal Appeal, 13 May 1974, unreported) which concerned an agreement by the offender that ten counts could be regarded as representative of some sixty-five charges. Phillips CJ, at 711, cited with approval from the judgment of the Court which said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… there is nothing objectionable in the court having regard to the whole picture presented by the accused’s conduct in determining the sentence appropriate to be passed upon the counts to which he has pleaded guilty”. 
        
       
      
    40    Ormiston JA referred to the practice in Victoria of charging “representative” counts. His Honour also referred to earlier authorities including Reiner, Godfrey and  Holyoak.  His Honour drew a clear distinction between a case in which counts have been accepted to be representative by the accused from a case in which conviction has followed after a plea of not guilty. 
     
      
    41    At 721-722, Ormiston JA distinguished the Queensland decision of R v D. His Honour noted at 721 that the Queensland Court of Appeal was there dealing with a sentence which followed from a conviction upon trial and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the emphasis was on the method to be adopted in making findings upon a sentencing hearing in relation to criminal offences for which the prisoner has not been charged and the extent to which they should be allowed to influence the sentence on the counts in fact charged. There is thus relatively little discussion of representative offences as such, although cases such as  
        Reiner  
        and

         are discussed in extenso. Consequently it is not surprising that the conclusions reached by the court and expressed in three numbered paragraphs at 87-8 did not refer to the use of representative charges”. 
        
       
      
    42    His Honour also went on to note, at 721-722, a further point of distinction between the situation in Queensland and that in Victoria, a distinction equally applicable in New South Wales. In the context of referring to the enunciated propositions in R v D, which I have quoted above, Ormiston JA said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The restrictive nature of the propositions may in part be justified by reference to the existence in Queensland of an offence known as ‘maintaining a sexual relationship with a child under sixteen years’.” 
        
       
      
    43    The actual charges in R v D were indecently dealing with a child contrary to s210 of the Criminal Code. As Ormiston JA noted, the Queensland Criminal Code, in s229B, creates an offence of maintaining a sexual relationship with a child. The maximum penalty under s210 is ten years imprisonment. The maximum penalty under s229B is life imprisonment. The definition of “maintaining a relationship” in s229B(1) requires sexual acts to have occurred on three or more occasions. This, accordingly, directly invokes the reasoning in De Simoni, in that the course of conduct creates a more serious offence. R v D is distinguishable. With respect to the period after 1 January 2000 the position in New South Wales may, in this respect, be similar by reason of the enactment of s66EA of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) which creates a new offence for the situation in which a person has committed a sexual offence on a child on three or more separate occasions. 
     
      
    44    The proposition which the Applicant derives from R v D is that the element of asymmetry in sentencing - i.e. allowing a discount in certain circumstances, but not imposing a greater penalty in the absence of those circumstances - infringes the principle that a person should not be punished for a crime for which they have not been convicted. 
     
      
    45    I recall the observation of Fullagar J in Attorney-General for New South Wales v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd (1951-1952) 85 CLR 237 at 285 to resist: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the temptation, which is so apt to assail us, to import a meretricious symmetry into the law.” 
        
       
      
    46    In my opinion, the relevant part of the reasoning of the Queensland Court of Appeal in R v D is inconsistent with the subsequent decision of the High Court in Siganto v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 656. That case was concerned with the effect of a plea of guilty. However, the asymmetry which the Queensland Court of Appeal identified in R v D, and dismissed as illogical, is also reflected in the case law with respect to a guilty plea, in a manner affirmed by the High Court in Siganto.  
     
      
    47    In a joint judgment, Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ said at [22]: 
     
      
       
        
        “A person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to plead not guilty, and defend himself or herself, without thereby attracting the risk of the imposition of a penalty more serious than would otherwise have been imposed. On the other hand, a plea of guilty is ordinarily a matter to be taken into account in mitigation; first, because it is usually evidence of some remorse on the part of the offender, and second, on the pragmatic ground that the community is spared the expense of a contested trial. The extent of the mitigation may vary depending on the circumstances of the case. It is also sometimes relevant to the aspect of remorse that a victim has been spared the necessity of undergoing the painful procedure of giving evidence.” 
        
       
      
    48    The Court went on to note at [23] that: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is proper for a sentencing judge to observe, in a particular case, that circumstances which might otherwise attract leniency are absent. A trial judge’s reference to the absence from the case of a matter of mitigation does not mean that the judge is indicating the presence of a circumstance of aggravation.” 
        
       
      
    49    The trial judge in Siganto had applied the reasoning in an earlier decision of the Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeal in which the Court had identified the distress occasioned by the complainant having to give evidence as a matter of aggravation (R v Martin (Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, Court of Criminal Appeal, 27 March 1995, unreported). The High Court held that this proposition should be rejected. It expressly approved the principle which was stated by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v Gray [1977] VR 225 at 231 that: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is impermissible to increase what is a proper sentence for the offence committed in order to mark the court’s disapproval of the accused’s having put the issues to proof or having presented a time-wasting or even scurrilous defence.” 
        
       
      
    50    The High Court went on to say at [34]: 
     
      
       
        
        “To some, it may appear a matter of semantics to distinguish between denying the existence of circumstances of mitigation and asserting the existence of circumstances of aggravation; and judicial statements intended as the former may sometimes be misunderstood as intending latter. However, the distinction can be important.” 
        
       
      
    51    The High Court’s reference to “semantics” is equivalent to Bray CJ’s use of the phrase “approach the metaphysical” in Reiner. 
     
      
    52    In my opinion the decision of the High Court in Siganto is applicable by analogy to the situation of representative counts. The line of authority reflected in such cases as Reiner, H and Holyoak remains good law. 
     
      
    53    The reasoning in Siganto may also be inconsistent with the line of authority supporting the proposition that an admission of other offences may, in some circumstances, be taken into account by way of aggravation. These cases are not limited to the express statutory regime for taking such offences into account. They do require a clear admission. 
     
      
    54    In England the Court of Appeal considered the practice of specimen counts in R v Kidd [1998] 1 WLR 604 (reported sub nom R v Canavan [1998] 1 Cr App R 79). Lord Bingham CJ said at 607; 81-82: 
     
      
       
        
        “A defendant is not to be convicted of any offence with which he is charged unless and until his guilt is proved. Such guilt may be proved by his own admission or (on indictment) by the verdict of a jury. He may be sentenced only for an offence proved against him (by admission or verdict) or which he has admitted and asked the court to take into consideration when passing sentence: see  
        R v Anderson (Keith) 
         [1978] AC 964. If, as we think, these are basic principles underlying the administration of the criminal law, it is not easy to see how a defendant can lawfully be punished for offences for which he has not been indicted and which he has denied or declined to admit. 
        
       
       
        
        It is said that the trial judge, in the light of the jury’s verdict can form his own judgment of the evidence he has heard on the extent of the offending conduct beyond the instances specified in individual counts. But this, as it was put in  
        R v Hutchison 
         [1972] 1 WLR 398, 400 is to ‘deprive the appellant of his right to trial by jury in respect of the other alleged offences’. Unless such other offences are admitted, such deprivation cannot in our view be consistent with principle.” 
        
       
      
    55    The effect of the judgment of the Court of Appeal is that, absent an admission, the court should not take into account commission of other offences when sentencing for particular offences charged. The position is otherwise, it appears, in the case of an admission. 
     
      
    56    The reasoning of the Court of Appeal in Kidd is consistent with the reasoning of Brennan J in Kingswell v The Queen (1985) 159 CLR 264 at 288-289: 
     
      
       
        
        “Even where the practice of charging a representative offence has been sanctioned, it has been held essential that the express and unequivocal assent of the offender be given before an offence for which he has not been convicted is taken into account:  
        R v Anderson 
         [1978] AC 964 at 977. Without the offender’s assent it would be wrong to deprive him of his right to trial by jury for that offence:  
        R v Huchison 
         [1972] 1 WLR 398; (1972) 56 Cr App R 307;  
        R v Reiner 
         (1974) 8 SASR 102”. 
        
       
      
    57    In SBL the Director of Public Prosecutions submitted that the whole of the circumstances, including the duration of the offending and the context of the acts which were not subject to specific charges, constituted an aggravating circumstance. However, counsel for the respondent offender in SBL did not challenge the use the Director of Public Prosecutions submitted could be made of these uncharged acts.  
     
      
    58    As Ormiston JA said at 724-725: 
     
      
       
        
        “Here the facts relating to the seven counts made abundantly clear that there was both planning and deliberation of a kind characteristic of an admitted paedophile. Having regard to the fact that counsel for the respondent did not dispute the director’s submissions as to the manner in which representative counts should in general be dealt with on sentence, it would perhaps be unwise to go further than to say that the whole of the circumstances relating to each count must be given proper effect and recognition for the purposes of imposing a just sentence, paying due regard to recognised principles of proportionality and totality”. 
        
       
      
    59    I do not understand Ormiston JA, in these guarded observations, to be adopting the submissions of the Director. 
     
      
    60    However, Batt JA in SBL, expressed the opinion at 725 that the submission of the Director of Public Prosecutions to the effect that the fact that a charge is agreed to be “representative” constituted an aggravating circumstance, was “the better view”. His Honour did not, however, regard this approach as punishing an offender for an offence for which he has not been charged, contrary to the principle expressed in, inter alia, De Simoni. Batt JA said at 726: 
     
      
       
        
        “Not only does the fact that a count is agreed to be representative preclude its being said in mitigation that the offence was isolated, it affirmatively enables the offence to be seen in its full circumstantial context. The offender is not, by a loading of the sentence, to be punished for the represented offences, but the sentence for the representative offence may reflect the fact that it, the offence counted, occurred in the wider context. Consistently with the view that I have expressed about agreed representative counts, regard may in the present case be had to the adverse effect upon the victims of the whole of the conduct, which effect might not have been produced, or produced to the same extent, by the offences counted alone.” 
        
       
      
    61    King CJ said in The Queen v Austin (1985) 121 LSJS 181 at 183 in a passage quoted with approval by Olsson J in R v Zahra [1998] SASC 7010 at [18]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is true that in imposing sentence for a crime, a judge should take into account not only the conduct which actually constitutes the crime, but also such of the surrounding circumstances as are directly related to that crime and are properly to be regarded as circumstances of aggravation or circumstances of mitigation. 
        
       
       
        
        Just what surrounding circumstances are properly to be taken into account in a particular case is a matter of degree. The courts have to be particular cautious when the circumstances relied upon themselves may constitute crimes. Often the circumstances amount to crimes of a similar character to that charged and can more readily be taken into account as circumstances of aggravation. Likewise where the criminality of the aggravating circumstances is clearly subsidiary to as well as related to the criminality involved in the conduct constituting the crime charged. Special care, however, is required when the circumstances relied upon as circumstances of aggravation themselves constitute crimes or may constitute crimes of a different character or crimes against different victims. 
        
       
       
        
        If a person is to be punished for conduct which is said to be criminal, generally speaking justice requires that he be charged with it and have the opportunity of defending himself. If he is not charged with it, generally speaking it should not be relied upon as a circumstance of aggravation of some other crime. This, of course, is not a hard and fast rule; everything must depend upon the particular circumstances and, as I have said, it is very much a matter of degree.” 
        
       
      
    62    It may be that since King CJ delivered judgment in The Queen v Austin, the degree of flexibility his Honour referred to, has come to be no longer appropriate.  
     
      
    63    In my opinion, to use such matters as a circumstance of aggravation, if permissible at all, requires, at the least, sufficient particularisation so that the sentencing judge can tell with precision what range of conduct the charges admitted to be “representative” are in fact representative of. The extent, if any, to which an admission, other than in the context of the statutory procedure to which I have referred above, can be taken into account as a matter of aggravation, should be carefully confined. 
     
      
    64    As I understand the reasoning of Lord Bingham in Kidd and Brennan J in Kingswell, it relates only to admissions of specific charges which do not form part of an indictment. Any such admission must, at least, in my opinion, be referrable to a precise and properly particularised incident or incidents. It is, of course, a matter for the Crown to strike the proper balance between overloading an indictment, on the one hand, and, failing to reflect the alleged criminality by charging a limited range of counts, on the other hand. 
     
      
    65    It is highly desirable that the formal statutory procedures should be followed wherever the Crown seeks to rely on offences not contained within the indictment on the issue of penalty. As I have noted, those procedures exist both in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for State offences and in s16BA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) for Commonwealth offences. These procedures ensure that a proper particularisation is available, so that the range of conduct can be assessed with precision.  
     
      
    66    It is not, however, necessary, to express a concluded opinion about whether, and if so how, admissions of uncharged offences can be taken into account by way of aggravation, other than pursuant to an express statutory scheme. (In my opinion, the reasoning in Siganto suggests, by way of analogy, that such use is not permissible). The reason why it is not necessary to decide the issue in this case is because the admission on the part of the Applicant did not have the necessary degree of precision. 
     
      
    67    In the present case there was an express admission on the part of the Applicant that the particular counts with respect to daughter DW were “representative”. That admission extended to an admission of the general nature of the relationship as set out in the uncontested evidence of DW. I do not, however, conclude that the admission extended to any, let alone each, of the specific allegations contained in DW’s evidence.  
     
      
    68    An admission of this general character is appropriate to be taken into account for purposes of rejecting any claim to mitigation and attendant reduction of an otherwise appropriate sentence. It is not, however, in my opinion, appropriate to be taken into account as a circumstance of aggravation, if that be permissible at all. 
     
      
    69    Approaching the sentencing task in accordance with the above principles, I agree with the orders proposed by Ireland J. 
     
      
       
      
    70    IRELAND J: The applicant seeks an extension of time in which to appeal against conviction and leave to appeal against severity of sentence with regard to four charges to which he pleaded guilty at Dubbo Local Court and later adhered to those pleas before his Honour Judge Gibson QC in the Penrith District Court on 8 August, 1997. 
     
      
    71    The charges were as follows:- 
     
      
       
      Count 1: 
       
      
    72    For that he between 1 January, 1975 and 30 June, 1975 at Forbes in the State of New South Wales did carnally know DAW, a girl then under the age of ten years, to wit six years of age. 
     
      
    73    In contravention of S 67 of the Crimes Act 1900 which at the time of the offence carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 
     
      
       
      Count 2: 
       
      
    74    For that he between 9 December 1976 and 9 December 1977 at Forbes in the State of New South Wales did unlawfully and carnally know DAW, a girl then under the age of ten years. 
     
      
    75    In contravention of S 67 of the Crimes Act, 1900 which offence carried, at the time of the offence, a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 
     
      
       
      Count 3: 
       
      
    76    For that he between 1 January, 1981 and 31 December, 1981 at Orange in the State of New South Wales did unlawfully and carnally known SMW, a girl then over the age of ten years and under the age of sixteen years, to wit between the age of thirteen and fourteen years. 
     
      
    77    In contravention of S 71 of the Crimes Act, 1900 which offence carried a maximum penalty of ten years penal servitude. 
     
      
       
      Count 4: 
       
      
    78    For that he between 9 December, 1981 and 9 December, 1982 at Orange in the State of New South Wales did unlawfully and carnally know SMW, a girl then above the age of ten years and under the age of sixteen years, to wit between the age of fourteen and fifteen years. 
     
      
    79    In contravention of S 71 of the Crimes Act, 1900 which offence carried a maximum penalty of ten years penal servitude. 
     
      
    80    On 14 August, 1997 the applicant was sentenced as follows:- 
     
      
    81    As to count 1: Minimum term of 10 years penal servitude to commence 8 August, 1997 and to expire 7 August, 2007 with an additional term of 2 years to commence 8 August, 2007 and to expire on 7 August, 2009. 
     
      
    82    As to each of counts 2, 3 and 4: Concurrent fixed terms of 4 years penal servitude to commence 8 August, 1997 and to expire 7 August, 2001. 
     
      
    83    In passing sentence, the sentencing judge noted that the penalties for the offences against a child under the age of 10 years in the equivalent section of the Crimes Act had been reduced to 20 years, i.e. the offences in contravention of S 67 of the Crimes Act, 1900 whilst the maximum penalty in respect of the offences in contravention of S 71, or more correctly, its then current equivalent, remained at 10 years penal servitude (now, imprisonment). The sentencing of the applicant proceeded on the basis of the current maximum penalties at the time of sentence. 
     
      
    84    The facts which gave rise to the charges are not in dispute and are as follows.  
     
      
    85    In 1979 the family were living in Central Western New South Wales. SMW was then aged six years. On one occasion, just after her sixth birthday, the applicant called her into the bathroom where he was seated naked in the bath. He made her get into the bath and touched her on the breast. He took hold of her hand and placed it on his penis before SMW managed to get away. In 1982 the family had moved to another Central Western city. SMW was asleep in bed one night when the applicant got into bed with her, removed her pants and forced her to have vaginal intercourse with him. 
     
      
    86    On another occasion in 1982, SMW went away for a weekend with the applicant to assist him in droving sheep. Whilst asleep in her bunk in the caravan one evening, the applicant forcibly restrained her, removed her pyjama pants and raped her. She was screaming and crying throughout this encounter. As a result of this intercourse, SMW was bleeding the following day. Four months after this incident, SMW was again away with the applicant droving sheep when he pushed her onto a tarpaulin laid on the ground, removed her jeans and forcibly had vaginal intercourse with her. When SMW said that she would tell her mother, the applicant threatened to blow her brains out. SMW was terrified and did not mention the incident to anyone. This sexual abuse continued until SMW was aged sixteen and left home. 
     
      
    87    SMW and her twin sister DAW were born on 9 December, 1967. The basis upon which sentencing of the applicant proceeded was the statements made by the two complainants. 
     
      
    88    The statements of the complainants were unchallenged and the deponents were not cross-examined.  
     
      
    89    DAW stated that on one occasion when she was five years of age, the applicant took her in his truck to a remote area where he removed her underpants and struck her when she tried to resist. He forcefully penetrated her vaginally and ejaculated onto her stomach. This was not the first occasion and the applicant had done this to her previously on many occasions. This sexual abuse continued for the next ten years ranging in frequency from once a day to once a month. 
     
      
    90    On one occasion when DAW was aged seven and a half years, she came home from school and was changing out of her school uniform when the applicant approached her and made her take off her underwear.  
     
      
    91    He hit her across the face, pushed her onto the bed and forced her to have sexual intercourse with him. When she was nine years of age, the applicant called her over to where he was lying naked on the bed playing with his penis. He forced her to take off her clothes and get onto the bed next to him where he slapped her because she was screaming as he forcefully had sexual intercourse with her. On this occasion also, the applicant ejaculated over her stomach. DAW recalled that she used to cut her finger with a razor blade to smear blood on a sanitary pad, using this device to convince the applicant that she was menstruating when he approached her. When DAW was aged fourteen years, she threatened to tell the police of the sexual abuse. The applicant then stopped interfering with her sexually. 
     
      
    92    The applicant was interviewed by way of electronic record of interview. He initially denied having sexually abused his daughter DAW and said that she was lying. He later said that he had told his two sons S and G that he had sexual relations with DAW and SMW. He could not recall clearly as to whether or not he had a sexual relationship with DAW but said that it was possible. He admitted sexually abusing SMW. 
     
      
    93    The basis upon which the pleas of guilty were entered and upon which the learned sentencing judge proceeded to sentence was that the charges pleaded to were representative of a number of similar incidents which occurred over a period of time. Counsel for both the prosecution and the defence adopted this approach in their submissions on sentence. 
     
      
    94    The applicant’s case in mitigation included the following. The applicant gave sworn evidence at the sentence proceedings expressing his remorse. A report from Dr Robert Strum was tendered. This report disclosed that the applicant’s father died during the Second World War. He lived with his mother and step-father for some years until they separated. He then lived with his grandmother and rarely saw his mother. 
     
      
    95    Until the age of 8 years, the applicant’s mother used to take him into bed with her where he would lie naked while she masturbated herself. When the applicant was aged 12, he had a sexual relationship with his aunt, who was then aged 15 years. He also had a sexual relationship with his half-sister, who was one and a half years younger than he was. 
     
      
    96    The applicant left home when he was twelve and a half years old and ultimately became a stockman and drover. The applicant started sexually abusing DAW in 1976 when she was aged 7 years. He commenced sexually abusing SMW when she was 14 years of age (these events related by the applicant conflict with those alleged by the complainants). The applicant expressed the belief that his sexual misbehaviour was in some way connected with his relationship with his mother. 
     
      
    97    Dr Strum expressed the opinion that the applicant does not suffer from a psychiatric illness “He has led a life which is perhaps not so uncommon in some parts of the country but which is certainly alien to most people.” 
     
      
    98    In his interview with Dr Strum, the applicant demonstrated very little remorse. He did not exhibit a personality disorder and is not a paedophile who seeks out children at random. In the view of Dr Strum, the applicant was subjected to incest as a child and saw little wrong with incest with his own children. 
     
      
    99    Six grounds of appeal are proffered. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: 
       
       
      His Honour erred in sentencing the applicant for offences which were barred from prosecution by statute. 
       
      
    100    At the time of the offences alleged in counts 3 and 4, S 78 of the Crimes Act, 1900 prohibited prosecution after the expiration of twelve months, if the victim was aged between 14 and 16 years. 
     
      
    101    The victim SMW turned 14 on 9 December, 1981. She was accordingly aged 14 at the time of the events alleged in count 4. 
     
      
    102    There is nothing in the complainant’s statement that would enable the charge laid in count 3 to be supported by confining the dates to the pre-aged 14 period. S 78 accordingly has application to both counts 3 and 4. 
     
      
    103    S 78 was repealed on 3 May, 1992 by the Criminal Legislation Amendment Act, 1992. Counsel for the respondent, in his written submissions, notes that there is no presumption against retrospectivity in the case of statutes which affect mere procedure, however, statutes of limitation which operate in a way as to affect existing rights and obligations fall within the presumption against retrospective operation, Rodway v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 515 at 518-9. 
     
      
    104    It is further pointed out that the policy of the Director of Public Prosecutions was acknowledged in  R v DJT (unreported CCA 24.2.99 per McInerney J at para. 14):- 
     
      
       
        
        “That notwithstanding the repeal of S 78 an accused should remain entitled to the twelve month limitation period where the offence had been committed prior to the repeal of the limitation period.” 
        
       
      
    105    Accordingly it is conceded by the Crown that the convictions on counts 3 and 4 should be quashed. 
     
      
    106    It is, however, contended that the appropriate step in the circumstances is for those matters to be remitted to the Local Court, pursuant to S 8A(1)  Criminal Appeal Act, 1912. This step, it is submitted, will enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider what charges, if any, should proceed in relation to SMW, the obvious consideration being charges under S 73 (carnal knowledge by a father).107    Grounds 2 and 3: 
     
      
       
      His Honour erred by sentencing the applicant on the basis that the pleas of guilty were representative of other similar acts of sexual misconduct and therefore could not be treated as isolated offences, ALTERNATIVELY his Honour erred by taking into account offences not charged in a manner other than to rebut the suggestion that the offences charged were not isolated incidents. 
       
      
    108    As indicated previously, his Honour noted that “the pleas were entered on the basis that they were representative of the conduct of the prisoner towards the two children”. 
     
      
    109    There can be no doubt in the present case that the approach adopted by the sentencing judge reflected the views of counsel, both for the prosecution and for the defence at the trial. 
     
      
    110    Mr Byrne of Senior Counsel for the applicant, whilst acknowledging the “representative” basis upon which the court, by general consensus, proceeded to sentence, nevertheless argued that the “representative charges” approach was not one which should have been adopted as a matter of law. 
     
      
    111    In a supplementary submission, received by the court on 30 March 2000, Mr Byrne drew to the court’s attention S 66EA of the Crimes Act 1900 which came into operation on 1 January 2000. Section 66EA captioned “Persistent sexual abuse of a child” provides in subsection (1) - A person who, on three or more separate occasions occurring on separate days during any period, engages in conduct in relation to a particular child that constitutes a sexual offence is liable to imprisonment for 25 years. 
     
      
    112    In eleven additional subsections S 66EA sets out a substantial codification of the offence of persistent sexual abuse of a child and effectively avoids the need for, first ‘representative’ charging and second, indictments containing large numbers of counts in cases involving sexual assaults against children (as submitted by Mr Byrne). 
     
      
    113    I have had the benefit of reading in draft form the judgment of Spigelman CJ with which I respectfully agree. Grounds 2 and 3 are not made out. 
     
      
    114    Grounds 4 and 5: 
     
      
      The sentencing judge erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the plea of guilty. 
       
       
      The sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that the applicant himself suffered sexual abuse as a child. 
       
      
    115    These grounds may be dealt with shortly and together. 
     
      
    116    His Honour made specific reference to the applicant’s plea of guilty in his remarks on sentence at 2.7 in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I take into consideration that he had pleaded guilty and has expressed his remorse. I accept the fact that he, by his pleas and his evidence, has relieved his daughters of the trauma of giving evidence in court and I accept that he pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity”. 
        
       
      
    117    As to the applicant’s background and the family relationships, to which he was subjected as a very young person himself, his Honour was mindful and remarked upon Dr Strum’s report and the influences which his background may have had upon him. These grounds are not made out. 
     
      
    118    Ground 6: 
     
      
      The sentence is manifestly excessive 
       
      
    119    This ground may be shortly dealt with. In his remarks on sentence, Judge Gibson made plain his application of the principle of totality in determining the sentence to be imposed on the first count saying, at page 4:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I propose to impose on the first count on the daughter (DAW) a sentence that will take into consideration the total criminality involved in this matter before me. Rather than impose separate and cumulative sentences for the offences committed on the twin sister”. 
        
       
      
    120    Accordingly it is conceded by the Crown that it will be necessary for this court to re-sentence the applicant, recognising the extent to which the totality of criminality will be affected by the quashing of counts 3 and 4. 
     
      
    121    Some statistical considerations were adverted to by counsel for the applicant, however, it must be recognised that the criminality involved in counts 1 and 2 is extremely high, the penalty prescribed being 20 years imprisonment in accordance with recent legislative change. In circumstances where grave and repeated sexual assaults are perpetrated upon a young child, in particular by a person in a position of trust and authority, condign punishment is called for.  R v Fisher  (1989) 40 A Crim R 442;  R v Hudson (unreported NSWCCA - 30.7.1998). 
     
      
    122    DAW in her statement dated 14 October, 1996, upon which the first and second counts in the indictment were laid, complained of a number of specific incidents of carnal knowledge, the first being when she was “about four or five years old”, the second when she was aged seven and a half, the third when she was nine years of age and a fourth incident when she was twelve years old. The earlier incidents were said to be representative of many other similar offences. 
     
      
    123    In his remarks on sentence, in relation to the first and second counts, the sentencing judge referred to the offences as having occurred when the victim was “seven years and 9 years”. Sentence was pronounced of a minimum term of 10 years with an additional term of 2 years on the first count and a fixed term of 4 years on the second count. Apart from the age of the complainant, the offences were of similar character and gravity. 
     
      
    124    In Pearce -v- The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 @ para. 45 in the joint judgment of the majority McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ their Honours said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “To an offender, the only relevant question may be “how long”, and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error. A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality” [citing  
        Mill -v- The Queen 
         (1998) 166 CLR 59]. 
        
       
      
    125    Absent considerations of totality with regard to counts 3 and 4, which must now be taken into account in resentencing on count 1, no sentencing error is evident in the sentence imposed for count 1. Even making allowance for the necessary adjustment of sentence (as to which see below), the divergence between the sentences passed on the first and second counts is manifestly excessive. However, the inadequacy of the sentence passed on the second count having not been raised either by crown appeal or in argument, it would be inappropriate for this court now to intervene. I shall return shortly to the sentence which I would propose. 
     
      
    126    Counsel for the applicant has submitted special circumstances exist which would warrant an additional term in excess of the statutory ratio pursuant to S 44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 (formerly S 5(2) of the Sentencing Act, 1989). There are factors, including the applicant’s age, his first time in custody and the fact that he may serve his sentence in protection, all of which may, in appropriate cases, amount to special circumstances. I am not persuaded, however, in the circumstances of this case that a longer parole period than that imposed by the sentencing judge is called for. 
     
      
    127    In the exercise of this court’s discretion I would decline to remit the matters raised under Counts 3 and 4 to the Local Court pursuant to S 8A(1) Criminal Appeal Act, 1912. 
     
      
    128    I would propose the following orders:- 
     
      
       
      1. That time in which the appeal may be brought be enlarged and the appeal allowed. 
       
       
      2. That the sentences imposed on 14 August, 1997 be quashed. 
       
       
      3. In lieu thereof, the Applicant be sentenced as follows:- 
       
       
      On Count 1: 
       
      
    129    A sentence of imprisonment for a period of 10 years commencing on 8 August, 1997 and expiring on 7 August, 2007. There will be a non-parole period of 8 years which will expire on 7 August, 2005. 
     
      
       
      On Count 2: 
       
      
    130    A sentence of imprisonment for a fixed term of 4 years to be served concurrently with the sentence in Count 1 to commence on 8 August, 1997 and to expire on 7 August, 2001. 
     
      
    131    The offender will be eligible for parole on 8 August, 2005. 
     
      
       
       
      
    132    SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgments of the Chief Justice and of Ireland J, with both of which I agree.

      REGINA v JAMES ATILLA RESS 
      
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
        
       
      
      
     1     
     GILES JA: We will proceed to the application. I think it appropriate something be said briefly to record how this position has come about. I would ask Grove J to do the necessary. 
      
       
      
     2     
     GROVE J: There is before the court an appeal against conviction on three counts of dangerous driving causing death, two counts of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm and one count of wanton driving causing bodily harm. The convictions were found after proceedings before his Honour Judge Nield in the Parramatta District Court. His Honour has not yet passed sentence in respect of the convictions. It is appropriate that we record some circumstances which have led to the orders which the court will make. 
      
       
      
     3     
     A trial before his Honour and a jury commenced at Parramatta and on the third day of the trial there was an indication in the absence of the jury that the appellant was willing to plead guilty to six of seven counts in the then current indictment. It can be noted in passing that the seventh count related to grievous bodily harm suffered by a passenger in the vehicle being driven by the appellant at the relevant time. That count was withdrawn by the Crown. 
      
       
      
     4     
     His Honour proceeded to follow the procedure approved, for example, in  
     R v Ross 
     , unreported CCA 20 April 1994. Unfortunately, neither counsel then appearing drew to his Honour's attention the applicable statutory provision made by section 399A of the  
     Crimes Act 
     . That section has since been repealed and replaced by section 91 of the  
     Criminal Procedure Act 
     . 
      
       
      
     5     
     Be that as it may, it would appear that on any view his Honour thereafter proceeded in circumstances which showed that he had accepted the pleas of guilty and intended to proceed to the matter of sentence. 
      
       
      
     6     
     This was interrupted by the filing of a notice of motion seeking in its terms leave to withdraw the pleas of guilty. Some evidence was taken in relation to that and, attention still not having been drawn to the statutory provision, his Honour proceeded to deliver a judgment, making findings of fact about the evidence before him and refusing the leave sought. 
      
       
      
     7     
     The appeal brought to this Court was couched in terms of being an appeal against conviction, although certain grounds which were filed seemed to be directed towards the correctness or otherwise of the judgment given by his Honour in the matter on motion. I should record that counsel presently appearing in the appeal were none of them counsel appearing at first instance. 
      
       
      
     8     
     The intent of the appellant is to have this Court exercise its jurisdiction to consider whether there has been miscarriage of justice in the acceptance of the pleas of guilty offered in the District Court. There are procedural problems involved in a number of aspects. 
      
       
      
     9     
     The judge at first instance heard evidence which, in the conventional course of a challenge such as that which I have mentioned, would be the subject of application for leave to be adduced as fresh evidence before this Court. Were this Court simply to act upon the evidence as recorded below, problems arise as to what weight, if any, can be given to findings of fact by the judge at first instance. Mr Berman of counsel, for the Crown, has also pointed out the inevitable handicap to the Crown in being prevented, if the course of looking at the evidence below were simply taken, from adducing evidence on its own behalf. 
      
       
      
     10     
     Ms McSpedden, leading counsel appearing for the appellant in this appeal, has sought instructions from her client. As is perfectly understandable, it would not be possible or practicable for admissions to be made conceding all the findings of fact by the trial judge. 
      
       
      
     11     
     The sentence of the appellant is still outstanding and the court raised with counsel the prospect of the matter being returned to the District Court for completion of the proceedings there. The intention is that upon completion of those proceedings the appellant should have preserved to himself any rights that he would have had but for the misapprehended excursion which has already taken place. In order to achieve this, counsel has sought instructions and confirmed them to this Court that the appeal should be, subject to the leave of the Court, withdrawn. That leave should, in my opinion, be granted. 
      
       
      
     12     
     These remarks are made in order to properly record that it is not the intention of the Court that there be any prejudice to the appellant or to the Crown in respect of respective rights arising out of the proceedings below. 
      
       
      
     13     
     Accordingly, I would propose that leave to withdraw the appeal be granted to the appellant. 
      
       
      
     14     
     GILES JA: I agree, and I adopt the remarks made by Grove J. 
      
       
      
     15     
     GREG JAMES J: As I do also. 
      
       
      
     16     
     GILES JA: The order is leave be granted to withdraw the appeal.

     REGINA v Scott Derek METCALF 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1    NEWMAN J: This is a Crown appeal brought against a sentence passed by O'Reilly DCJ sitting in the District Court at Liverpool on 16 December 1999. 
     
      
    2    Before his Honour the respondent had pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery while being armed with an offensive weapon which carried, pursuant to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act, 1900, a maximum penalty of penal servitude for twenty years. 
     
      
    3    Furthermore, he pleaded guilty to three counts of robbery in company which again attracts a maximum penalty of penal servitude for twenty years. In the event, his Honour sentenced the respondent to a sentence of periodic detention for a period of three years commencing on 7 January 2000. It was against that sentencing order which the Crown now seeks to appeal. 
     
      
    4    The offences to which the respondent pleaded guilty involved a series of events involving the respondent and two other young men, one Scott Tysluk and Andrew Bihary carrying out robberies at a number of service stations in the southern areas of this city. 
     
      
    5    The first of those offences took place at about 2.15 am on Tuesday 2 November 1998 at the Quix Service Station at Lansvale. The trio of Tysluk, Bihary and the respondent drove to that service station in the respondent's car. 
     
      
    6    The respondent was armed with a kitchen knife and Tysluk was armed with a baseball bat. Apparently, the weapons were supplied by Tysluk and Bihary. Ultimately, the respondent held a knife to the unfortunate console operator at the station, from whom he had purchased an ice-cream. Indeed, oddly enough, the respondent had paid for the ice-cream and when change was being given he held the knife to the unfortunate operator and made a demand for money. 
     
      
    7    At that time Tysluk approached the operator with the baseball bat. Needless to say, a demand was then made by one of the three, that the operator open the till and, wisely, as he did, pushing an alarm button at the same time. Some $50 or $60 was stolen and a magazine was also stolen. 
     
      
    8    Thus a serious breach of the law was committed particularly as the respondent was holding a knife in a situation where the prime victim, namely the console operator, was in a situation of great vulnerability. 
     
      
    9    The second matter involved the trio robbing a service station at Campbelltown. Again they travelled to that service station in the respondent's motor vehicle. They entered, and again a purchase was made from the console operator. One of the trio, not necessarily the respondent, produced a baseball bat. The respondent himself again had a knife in his hand. It seems that the baseball bat holder, probably Tysluk, demanded the till be opened and that happened. Cash was removed and cigarettes were also taken. In all some $673 in cash was stolen and about $140 worth of cigarettes. 
     
      
    10    The third count involved yet another attack upon a service station, again at Lansvale. Once more Mr Tysluk was armed with a baseball bat. Again the modus operandi involved an attempt to purchase an item and again once that part of the transaction had been completed a demand was made that money be removed from the till, this time a small amount of cash was in fact handed over. The console operator, after a demand was made for cigarettes, gave them packets of cigarettes. 
     
      
    11    The fourth count involved a service station at Yagoona. Again Tysluk was armed with a baseball bat. Having entered the service station a demand was made on the unfortunate console operator that he was to give one of them all his money. When the operator heard that he turned and saw one of the trio holding a baseball bat and another a knife. After some difficulty the operator opened the till, and money was taken from the till and the trio absconded. 
     
      
    12    The fifth count again involved a service station, this time at Warwick Farm. Again when the trio arrived Tysluk was armed with a baseball bat. Following a threat being made by Tysluk to the female console operator accompanied by a demand for money the operator acceded to the demand, not surprisingly, by opening the cash register and handing money to the others other than Tysluk. They then departed. 
     
      
    13    In due course the three were apprehended. Tysluk and Bihary were also dealt with by O'Reilly DCJ on 30 July 1999. Like the present respondent, both Tysluk and Bihary pleaded guilty. Again they, like the present respondent, were only young men, being twenty years of age at the time of sentence. The present respondent was then twenty and he is now twenty-one having turned twenty-one last month. 
     
      
    14    Having taken into account the subjective features relating to both those accused and the objective features are those which I have already referred to, O'Reilly DCJ sentenced them each to a maximum term of six years divided as to what is now known as a non-parole period of three years and a parole period of the same duration. 
     
      
    15    In sentencing Tysluk and Bihary O'Reilly DCJ made reference to the guideline judgment delivered by this Court in R v Henry & Ors (1996) 46 NSWLR at 346. In sentencing the present respondent his Honour, as the Crown pointed out in submissions, did not specifically refer to Henry's case, as he did when he sentenced the two co-offenders. My observation as to that absence is that I would not take it that his Honour was unaware of, nor did he fail to bear in mind the guideline judgment in Henry when he sentenced the present respondent. 
     
      
    16    The fact that he was keenly aware of it on 30 July 1999 is an ample indication for me that he would have had it in mind when he was dealing with the present respondent. 
     
      
    17    Essentially, there were, as in distinction from the subjective features which existed in relation to Tysluk and Bihary, a number of potent subjective features in relation to this respondent. 
     
      
    18    The first matter and one in which a good deal of the Crown submissions were directed to here, was the fact that the respondent, prior to the commission of these offences, had suffered from the psychiatric condition of schizophrenia and, apparently, had been diagnosed as suffering from that condition from the age of thirteen. 
     
      
    19    The second factor which emerged was that the respondent had, when arraigned in the Supreme Court by Barr J, indicated that he was willing to give evidence in the matter for the Crown against his co-accused, thus bringing into the subjective matters the question of section 442B(2) of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    20    Thirdly, the respondent had been released on bail on 1 December 1998 by the Supreme Court. Following his release on bail, as part of his conditions of bail, the applicant was required to seek treatment from a psychiatrist, Dr Roberts. He complied with that condition of bail and, in fact, saw Dr Roberts, as I would understand Dr Roberts' reports, on many occasions between the time he first saw that doctor and the time when the doctor prepared a second report (a report which was before O'Reilly DCJ) dated 14 October 1999. 
     
      
    21    During the period when he was under Dr Roberts’ care the respondent provided no less than thirty six drug free urine specimens. 
     
      
    22    While on bail, the respondent had obtained employment in a spare parts business in the southern suburbs and had not only held that employment but it had changed in character from casual to full-time employment. In other words, a matter going to rehabilitation. 
     
      
    23    The fourth factor, of course, and the matter dealt with in the guideline judgment, is the fact that all the participants in the criminal ventures are young. As I have said, the present respondent was born on 10 May 1979, so he turned twenty-one only last month. 
     
      
    24    The Crown's principal argument in the matter is that his Honour failed to properly take into account what had fallen from this Court in Henry. The Crown rightly submitted that the categorisation made by the Chief Justice of the type of case which would fall within the guidelines advanced in Henry's case involved some or all of the seven matters. Oddly enough, this present respondent would seem to fall within each of the seven features adverted to by the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    25    In Henry, however, the Chief Justice pointed out that following what had fallen from Hunt CJ at CL, in R v Roberts (1994) 73 A Crim R 306 at 308, that a non-custodial sentence for an offence such as the ones which the respondent stood charged with, could only be imposed in exceptional circumstances. 
     
      
    26    The question, therefore, which arises in this case is: Were there exceptional circumstances such as to enable his Honour properly to impose a sentence other than that of full-time custody. 
     
      
    27    I turn to the matters which were relied upon before his Honour and relied on before this Court as constituting those exceptional circumstances. As I have said, the respondent had suffered from a psychiatric condition, namely, schizophrenia since he was aged thirteen. His Honour in his findings specifically found, having read Dr Roberts' two reports which were tendered before him, that the respondent knew that it was wrong to take money. He knew what he was doing and he knew it was wrong. Plainly enough, Dr Roberts had been turning his attention to the question of the M’Naughten rules and as his Honour rightly recounts, Dr Roberts did not consider that the respondent fell within the ambit of the M’Naughten rules. 
     
      
    28    However, on my reading of Dr Roberts' reports, the condition of schizophrenia, and a reaction to a drug which had been incorrectly prescribed, namely, Zolaf, resulted in the respondent having a lack of capacity to resist doing acts which he later knew to be wrong. That to me is a matter of some importance, particularly when one looks at what had fallen from this Court in R v Wright (1997) 73 A Crim R 48, where again Hunt CJ at CL, dealt with the principles which emerged in cases involving mental disorder or abnormality. He there said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is an accepted principle of sentencing that general deterrence should often be given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental abnormality because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others."" 
        
       
      
    29    Later he went on to observe that the considerations of general or personal deterrence are not rendered completely irrelevant and the significance of the defendant's mental capacity is weighed and evaluated in the light of the particular facts and circumstances of the individual case. 
     
      
    30    Finally, at page 51, Hunt J observed: 
     
      
       
        
        ""But when the offender acts with knowledge of what he is doing and knowledge of the gravity of his actions, then the moderation need not be great."" 
        
       
      
    31    This passage was relied on by the Crown. However, as Hunt CJ at CL observed at page 52, that the respondent Wright, had quite deliberately left home, leaving his pills behind him and had either deliberately or recklessly become intoxicated by drugs, therefore, bringing on the psychiatric state which the doctors had diagnosed. No such factor as that exists in this case. 
     
      
    32    I might say, in my view, standing alone, the underlying psychiatric condition would not of itself provide exceptional circumstances which should result or could result in a sentencing Judge not imposing a full-time custodial sentence as would follow from the application of the principle in Henry's case. However, that is not, as I have indicated already, the only matter.  
     
      
    33    The fact is that the respondent was prepared to give evidence against his two co-conspirators. Undoubtedly, and the Crown does not dispute this, that is a matter which should give rise to a discount.  
     
      
    34    There is the matter of rehabilitation. It is the fact that Dr Roberts advanced the opinion that during the ten months or so under which the respondent was in his care a substantial improvement in his condition had been noticed. He had remained drug-free during that time and had obtained full-time employment. In other words, the factor of rehabilitation loomed strongly in the matter. Again, I would be of the view that the rehabilitation factor standing alone would not be sufficient to avoid the imposition of a sentence of full-time custody. 
     
      
    35    Another matter which is not specifically referred to by his Honour is the fact that persons of tender years, suffering from a psychiatric condition, notoriously had difficulty in coping with prison life, a matter again going to mitigation. 
     
      
    36    It seems to me that when one takes all the mitigating factors which were quite different, I should add, from the subjective features raised on behalf of the two co-accused, into account, that, in fact, exceptional circumstances of the type referred to in Roberts' case by Hunt CJ at CL and adopted by the Chief Justice in Henry's case, do exist here. 
     
      
    37    That being so, I am of the view that, in fact, his Honour did not fall into error in this case in imposing the non full-time custodial sentence which he did. I should stress that exceptional circumstances mean exactly what the words connote: Namely, the circumstances need to be exceptional. Here they are and it may be that this is a rare case but that is as I would view the facts of the matter and the findings of his Honour. 
     
      
    38    Accordingly, I am of the view that the Crown appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    39    SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree. One of the principal objects served by a sentencing guideline judgment such as that in R v Henry is to ensure consistency in decisions by trial Judges. It is, of course, equally applicable to this Court that it maintains consistency in its own decisions, including the circumstances in which the guidelines in Henry fall to be applied. 
     
      
    40    In the present case, his Honour sentenced the two co-offenders for terms in custody, applying the guidelines in Henry. His Honour expressly addressed the question of whether or not he could, consistently with the sentences he had earlier imposed, impose a lesser sentence on the respondent. His Honour analysed the particular factors that led him to the conclusion that he could do so. These were all factors of mitigation which in Henry itself at paragraph 169 were identified as facts and matters which could justify a sentence below the range specified in Henry itself. 
     
      
    41    I agree with the reasons given by Newman J for coming to the conclusion that the facts and matters to which his Honour has referred, were such as meant that a non full-time custodial sentence was within the range of permissible discretion to be exercised by his Honour in the circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    42    I note in particular that his Honour appeared to give special emphasis to the offer of assistance. His Honour noted that the offer of assistance had, in fact, been reported in a local newspaper and resulted in threats to the respondent. In these circumstances, the respondent was entitled to a substantial discount because of the offer of assistance which had been given in such circumstances and which, one can infer, led to the co-offenders entering pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    43    This is a factor which is of significance in the exercise of his Honour's discretion. His Honour was entitled to give it significant weight, including sufficient weight to overcome the exceptional circumstances test for the determination of whether a sentence, other than a full-time custodial sentence for this offence, is appropriate. 
     
      
    44    However, the respondent should have no doubt that if he were to offend again in this or any equivalent manner, the overwhelming probability is that he will go to gaol. 
     
      
    45    I agree with the order that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    46    ADAMS J: I also agree with the orders and with the reasons given both by the Chief Justice and Newman J. 
     
      
       
      
    47    SPIGELMAN CJ: The order is that the appeal is dismissed.

       REGINA v Alejandro Arturo TORO-MARTINEZ 
        
       
       
       
      The Appellant was charged with being knowingly concerned in the importation of a trafficable quantity of cocaine. As a preliminary issue, he applied for a permanent stay of proceedings on the basis of the involvement of the authorities in the importation. This application was rejected by Ainslie-Wallace DCJ. The Appellant then changed his plea to guilty and was sentenced by her Honour to three and a half years imprisonment, with a two year non-parole period. The Appellant appealed against his conviction and the Crown appealed against the sentence imposed. 
       
       
      Held 
       
       
      (

      Conviction Appeal 
       
       
      1 An appeal against conviction notwithstanding a guilty plea is permissible in limited circumstances. The test is whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred. The Court will only permit an appeal against conviction after a plea of guilty save in extreme circumstances, where the material shows that there is a real question about the guilt of the accused.

       (Supreme Court of NSW, Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 December 1993, unreported) approved.

      2 A typographical error in the date on a certificate granted under s15M of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1914 (Cth) where the intent is plain and the error obvious, does not qualify the validity of the certificate in so far as it specifies a day in accordance with the discretion to do so in s15N(4). The day “specified” within s15P(3)(a) is the intended date. Her Honour was correct in rejecting the challenge to the certificate in this case. 
       
       
      3 Nothing in the evidence suggested that the actions of the authorities involved in the matter played any material role in the conduct of the Appellant. No impropriety or contravention of law could be discerned that would justify the exclusion of the evidence. There is no basis for interfering with her Honour’s discretion to admit the evidence under s134 of the  
      Evidence Act 
      .  
      Ridgeway v The Queen

       REGINA v Alejandro Arturo TORO-MARTINEZ 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
       
        
       
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: Alejandro Arturo Toro-Martinez pleaded guilty to a charge under s233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) of being knowingly concerned in the importation of not less than a trafficable quantity of cocaine. Her Honour Judge Ainslie-Wallace sentenced him on 26 November 1999 to three and a half years imprisonment with a two year non-parole period to commence on 9 June 1998, being the date on which he had been taken into custody.  
     
      
    2    On 5 November 1999 her Honour had considered a preliminary issue, namely, an application for a permanent stay of the proceedings and, it appears, an application in the alternative that certain evidence not be admitted, each on the basis of the involvement of the authorities in the importation and the subsequent dealing with the imported cocaine. Upon this application being rejected, Mr Toro-Martinez changed his plea from not guilty to guilty. The Court is invited to infer that, but for her Honour's decision on this application, Mr Toro-Martinez would not have altered his plea. 
     
      
    3    The Court has before it an appeal against conviction which, on the authorities, is permissible notwithstanding the plea of guilty, albeit in limited circumstances. The Court also has before it a Crown appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    4    Between May 1994 and February 1995 a Colombian national Castro-Vargas was an inmate at Long Bay gaol with the person subsequently referred to as the police informer ""Warren"". After the deportation of Castro-Vargas and the release of Warren, the former was in touch with the latter offering to send cocaine to Australia. Warren contacted the National Crime Authority (“NCA”) which proceeded to participate through Warren in the importation of cocaine. I will outline later the aspects of this participation which are material to the appeal of Toro-Martinez against his conviction. Included in that participation was the supply by Warren to Castro-Vargas of a series of addresses to which letters could be sent. 
     
      
    5    Between 19 September 1996 and 3 January 1997, twenty-three envelopes despatched in Colombia and Chile and addressed to five of the addresses supplied to Castro-Vargas arrived in Australia and were intercepted by the NCA. Each envelope contained some documents and a number of coloured plastic folders. There were fifty-eight such folders weighing 9.539 kilograms within which was impregnated 3.574 kilograms of pure cocaine. The mode of impregnation required a chemical process to extract the cocaine from the plastic. 
     
      
    6    By October 1996 Warren received information to the effect that a person, who became known as ""the chemist"", would arrive in Australia for the purpose of extracting the cocaine from the plastic covers. This person was a Mr Jorg Romero-Cepeda. It is Romero-Cepeda who introduced the appellant, Toro-Martinez, to the enterprise. 
     
      
    7    The Crown case was that the Appellant was only involved in the enterprise between 18 and 20 December 1996. The Crown case was that between those dates he was knowingly concerned in the importation of a trafficable quantity of cocaine. It was not alleged the Appellant was knowingly concerned in the importation of all of the twenty-three parcels which contained a commercial quantity of 3.573 kilograms as noted above. The Appellant's involvement was limited to the three particular days in which a trafficable quantity of 655.2 grams was involved. This was the quantity in the controlled delivery which the authorities permitted to occur. 
     
      
    8    It was common ground below, and on this appeal, that this was the amount of cocaine imported and in respect of which the allegation that the Appellant was knowingly concerned in the importation of cocaine, was based. 
     
      
    9    Other persons involved in the importation included Romero, whom I have mentioned as ""the chemist"". There was also a Mr Douglas Robertson, the owner of a farm, who permitted the clandestine laboratory to be set up in the shed on his property and also drove vehicles involved in the transport of the chemicals required for the operation. In addition there was a Mr Cardona-Reinoso who assisted Romero in various respects, including transferring chemicals and attending the laboratory. 
     
      
    10    The Crown case against the Appellant, Toro-Martinez, including the following acts of participation in importation: 
     
      
    · He attended a number of meetings with Romero and his accomplices. 
     
      
    · He wrote down the list of chemicals required for the extraction of the cocaine from the plastic folders. 
     
      
    · He contacted Robertson with a view to engaging the use of his farm for the extraction process. 
     
      
    · He accompanied a person to deliver the chemicals to Robertson, that person being an undercover police officer ""Marcello."" 
     
      
    · He discussed the relative merits of cocaine from various South American countries, cocaine trafficking and drug cartels with another person, who was also an undercover police officer, ""Chris"". 
     
      
    · He was handed a bag containing the shredded plastic impregnated with cocaine by Chris. 
     
      
    · He rang Chris from the airport as he was departing and told him not to shred the plastic ""for the next time"". 
     
      
    11    The charge against the appellant related to a quantity of 655.2 grams of pure cocaine which was the amount comprised in a controlled delivery of some of the plastic covers as arranged by the NCA. Accordingly the Appellant was charged with, and fell to be sentenced, only with respect to his participation in this controlled delivery on the basis that he had been knowingly concerned in the importation of that amount. 
     
      
       
      The Conviction Appeal 
       
      
    12    Notwithstanding his plea of guilty, the Appellant contends that this is one of those exceptional cases in which the Court will set aside a conviction following a plea. The submission is made that the plea followed upon the unsuccessful challenge to the continuation of proceedings based, inter alia, on the admission into evidence of evidence that had been obtained through illegal or improper conduct on the part of the authorities. 
     
      
    13    An avenue of appeal against the decision on the preliminary matter by her Honour would have been an application for leave to this Court under s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The Appellant, however, took the course of pleading guilty and lodging an appeal based on alleged constitutional grounds, which have not been pressed, and two grounds which are pressed as follows: 
     
      
    · That the learned trial judge erred in law by holding that the officers of the Executive had not been knowingly concerned in the importation of a prohibited import, namely, cocaine from Colombia from July 1995 until December 1996. 
     
      
    · That the learned trial judge erred in law by holding that the officers of the Executive did not commit a number of illegal acts in connection with the relevant operation between July 1995 and December 1996. 
     
      
    14    The improprieties or illegalities allegedly committed by the authorities consisted of a range of acts over a period from July 1995 to December 1996. For almost the whole of this period, the Appellant had no participation in any relevant crime. It was a feature of the illegality alleged in the present case that it does not impinge in any respect on the involvement by the Appellant in the criminal enterprise. No inducement, trick or entrapment was employed by any representative of the authorities which involved the Appellant in any way. Rather, it is suggested, that certain aspects of conduct by the authorities meant that the actual importation and some subsequent steps within Australia were in some manner determined, or at least influenced by, such conduct. However, none of those acts influenced the Appellant to participate in the crimes. The submission appears to be that, but for that official conduct, the specific importation in which the Appellant was ""knowingly concerned"", on his own admission, would not have occurred. 
     
      
    15    In the present case, the appellant has given no evidence. No material concerning the circumstances relating to the change of his plea from not guilty to guilty is before the Court. What, if any, advice he was given is not the subject of any material before the Court. Rather, the Court is asked to infer that he would not have changed his plea but for the admission into evidence of evidence which was not specified with any degree of precision either at first instance or in this Court. 
     
      
    16    As Hunt J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Lee CJ at CL agreed, said in R v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231 at 233: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... an applicant will be permitted to withdraw a plea of guilty where he did not appreciate the nature of the charge to which the plea was entered. The applicant for such permission does of course bear the onus of establishing that he did not have such appreciation."" 
        
       
      
    17    In the absence of any evidence about the circumstances in which a plea of guilty was made, the Court is left to infer the circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice may have occurred. The only basis for such an inference is that the Appellant could not have been convicted and accordingly would not have changed his plea, if absolutely no evidence of the importation in which he was knowingly concerned, could have been adduced. 
     
      
    18    The issue sought to be raised in this case has some similarity with that considered in R v Chiron [1980] 1 NSWLR 218. In that case a plea of guilty to a charge of rape had been entered after the trial judge had ruled that evidence concerning another alleged rape by the accused in similar circumstances would be admitted as ""similar facts"". This was accompanied by an observation from the Judge, as understood by the then accused, that the admission of that evidence would be ""sudden death"" for his case. 
     
      
    19    Three quite different approaches are reflected in the judgments of this Court in Chiron. Street CJ found that by reason of the advice given by the accused's counsel and the Judge's comments, the plea of guilty was ""tainted"" and, accordingly was not ""a free and voluntary confession"". Both Nagle CJ at CL and Lee J found that the plea was freely and voluntarily given. Lee J held, dissenting, that in those circumstances there was no miscarriage of justice within the meaning of s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Nagle CJ at CL, however, agreeing in the result with Street CJ but for different reasons, concluded that there was a miscarriage of justice where ""an accused person freely and voluntarily but, nevertheless, induced by an incorrect ruling of the trial Judge as to the admissibility of material evidence"" changed his plea to guilty (221G). The different approaches reflected in Chiron have never been resolved in this Court. 
     
      
    20    It is undesirable to lay down a test which would attempt to define the circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice may be found to arise. Nevertheless, other than the judgment of Nagle CJ at CL in Chiron, no decision in this Court has allowed an appeal after a plea of guilty in the case of a mere wrongful admission of evidence which does not impinge on the quality of the plea in any manner. 
     
      
    21    A formulation which has frequently been referred to with approval is that of Sholl J in R v Murphy [1975] VR 187 at 191: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... for some other reason which enabled one to say that her plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt ..."" 
        
       
      
    22    To similar effect are the observations of Lee J (with whom McInerney and Campbell JJ agreed) in R v Sagiv (1986) 22 A Crim R 73 at 80, who applied a test of ""mistake or other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt ..."". 
     
      
    23    The significance of this factor is also affirmed in R v Cincotta (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Court of Criminal Appeal, 1 November 1995, unreported) in which Hunt CJ at CL with whom Grove and Allen JJ agreed, said at 1: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A person who has pleaded guilty will be permitted to withdraw that plea where it has been shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. The applicant for such permission bears the onus of showing the existence of that miscarriage. It will be shown to exist where, for example, the plea was induced by threats or other impropriety when the applicant would not otherwise have pleaded guilty. There must be shown to be some circumstance which indicates that  
        the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt. 
        "" (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    24    To similar effect is the reasoning in the joint judgment of Brennan, Toohey and McHugh JJ in Meissner v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 132 at 141 where their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A court will act on a plea of guilty when it is entered in open court by a person who is of full age and apparently of sound mind and understanding, provided the plea is entered in exercise of a free choice in the interests of the person entering the plea. There is no miscarriage of justice if a court does act on such a plea, even if the person entering it is not in truth guilty of the offence."" 
        
       
      
    25    Furthermore, as Dawson and McHugh JJ said in Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501 at 511: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The plea of guilty must however be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt. Those circumstances include ignorance, fear, duress, mistake, or even the desire to gain a technical advantage. The plea may be accompanied by a qualification indicating that the accused is unaware of its significance. If it appears to the trial judge, for whatever reason, that a plea of guilty is not genuine, he or she must (and it is not a matter of discretion) obtain an unequivocal plea of guilty or direct that a plea of not guilty be entered."" 
        
       
      
    26    Both Murphy and Sagiv were referred to with approval in this Court in R v Davies (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 December 1993, unreported) by Badgery-Parker J, with whom Wood and Matthews JJ agreed, at 3, 4 and 7 and which has frequently been referred to with approval. Badgery-Parker J concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The appellant's submissions that it would in the circumstances be unfair to hold him to his plea draws attention to the two factors which to my mind are the significant factors in this case. The test is whether the circumstances revealed a miscarriage of justice. The need to accord finality to a plea of guilty because of its status as a solemn admission of all of the ingredients of the offence is postulated upon knowledge by the person entering that plea of all the facts (see the passage cited earlier from the judgment of Lee J in  
        Sagiv 
        ) and it is not necessary to be accorded such finality if there are circumstances which indicate that the plea 'was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt' (per Sholl J in  
        Murphy 
          
        supra). If the integrity of the plea is bona fide questioned because it appears that the person who entered that plea was not in possession of all the facts and did not entertain a genuine consciousness of guilt, then in my opinion the plea of guilty ought to be set aside and a new trial ordered if (but only if, and the onus lies on the appellant) it is clear that there is, in the words of Sholl J 'an issuable question of guilt'- to put it more simply, if there is a real question to be tried. If the plea was not entered into with full knowledge of the facts and as a genuine recognition of guilt, and if the material before the Court of Criminal Appeal shows that there is a real question about the guilt of the accused, then the proper course must be to set aside the plea of guilty, to quash the conviction, and to order a new trial."" 
        
       
      
    27    Nothing in the subsequent judgments of this Court suggests that the approach of Nagle CJ at CL in Chiron should now be accepted to constitute the law. Nevertheless it is not necessary to decide the case on this basis. Rather the concluding reasoning in the decision in Davies as quoted above, affirmed in subsequent decisions of this Court in R v Ganderton (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Court of Criminal Appeal, 17 September 1998, unreported); R v Favero [1999] NSWCCA 320, is of direct application. This Court will only permit an appeal against conviction after a plea of guilty, to reiterate Davies: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… if the material before the Court of Criminal Appeal shows that there is a real question about the guilt of the accused ..."" 
        
       
      
    28    Nothing in the material before the Court in this case suggests anything of this character. In the case of Chiron, which is the most closely analogous to the present case, there was such a basis for questioning of guilt. In the present case no attempt has been made to suggest that the Appellant might not be guilty. The case for the Appellant rises no higher than, if certain evidence had been rejected, he would not have been found to be guilty. 
     
      
    29    Nothing is more calculated to bring the criminal justice system into disrepute than to treat it as some form of forensic game. The criminal justice system is designed to discover the truth. The protection of personal liberty embedded in our criminal procedure - including the presumption of innocence and the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt - do not constitute an invitation to manipulate or distort the truth. 
     
      
    30    The system recognises - not least in the discretion to exclude evidence illegally or improperly obtained - that the truth may cost too much. As Knight Bruce VC said in Pearse v Pearse (1946) 63 ER 950 at 957: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The discovery and vindication and establishment of truth are main purposes certainly of the existence of Courts of Justice; still, for the obtaining of these objects, which, however valuable and important, cannot be usefully pursued without moderation, cannot be either usefully or creditably pursued unfairly or gained by unfair means, not every channel is or ought to be open to them. The practical inefficacy of torture is not, I suppose, the most weighty objection to that mode of examination ... Truth, like all other good things, may be loved unwisely - may be pursued too keenly - may cost too much."" 
        
       
      
    31    See also Minet v Morgan (1873) LR 8 Ch App 361 at 368; Carter v Northmore Hale Davy and Leake (1994-1995) 183 CLR 121 at 133; The Queen v Ireland (1970) 126 CLR 321 at 335. 
     
      
    32    The occurrence of circumstances in which considerations of this character could be permitted to overturn a conviction after a plea of guilty, when there is not even a pretence of innocence is, to my mind, virtually inconceivable. In the application of a test as broad as ""miscarriage of justice"" I am not prepared to say that there can be no such circumstances. However, they would have to be extreme, not just extraordinary. Nothing of that character appears on the facts of this case.  
     
      
    33    The nature of the impropriety or illegality alleged in the present case concerned the official involvement with the importation of cocaine into Australia and the subsequent handling. The specific importation in which the appellant was said to be knowingly concerned, was the subject of a controlled delivery organised by the authorities.  
     
      
    34    A second, alternative, basis for this appeal arises from the existence of a certificate under s15M of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). That section is found in the new Pt 1AB inserted by the Crimes Amendment (Controlled Operations) Act 1996 (Cth) following upon the decision of the High Court in Ridgeway v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 19. The effect of the provision is that participation in an importation authorised in this manner does not constitute illegality, relevantly, for purposes of the exercise of the Ridgeway discretion or the parallel discretion found in s138 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    35    The offence with which the appellant was charged took place between 18 and 20 December 1996. There were two certificates obtained under s15M of the Crimes Act. The first was said to extend from 15 November 1996 until 14 December 1996. The Crown did not rely on that certificate. The Crown relied on the second certificate which was said to cover the period from ""13 December 1996 until 11 January 1996"". Before her Honour, and in this Court, the validity and scope of the second certificate was challenged by reason of the reference to ""January 1996"" in the second certificate. Her Honour found that the typographical error of inserting ""January 1996"" in lieu of ""January 1997"" was an immaterial error. I agree. This is the kind of typographical error that often occurs at the end of one calendar or the commencement of a new calendar year. The intent is plain and the error is obvious.  
     
      
    36    Attention was drawn in this Court to the provisions of s15N and s15P of the Crimes Act 1914. It was noted that subs15N(2) commencing with the words ""The certificate must …"" outlined a series of requirements for a certificate. The introductory words of s15(2), however, are to be contrasted with the provisions of s15N(4) which, with respect to the error relevant in the present case, states ""The certificate may specify a day (not later than 30 days after the day on which it was given) as the day on which the certificate is to cease to be in force”. Even with respect to the apparently mandatory requirements of subs15N(2), there is a specific provision in subs15N(5) to the effect: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A failure to comply with this section does not affect the validity of the certificate authorising a controlled operation."" 
        
       
      
    37    There was no basis on which, in my opinion, the typographical error of the date can qualify the validity of the certificate in so far as it specifies a day in accordance with the discretion to do so identified in subs15N(4). 
     
      
    38    In the alternative, the appellant relied on the provisions of s15P which, relevantly, provided in subs(3): 
     
      
       
        
        ""A certificate remains in force: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) if the certificate specifies a day on which it is to cease to be in force - until the end of that day."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    39    The submission of the Appellant is that the day “specified” is the day which appears on the face of the certificate, namely, 11 January 1996. That day has long since passed and there was, accordingly, no certificate in force on the relevant days, namely, the days between 18 and 20 December 1996 inclusive. 
     
      
    40    In my view, the proper construction of the terminology, namely, ""the certificate specifies a day"", can accommodate a typographical error which is obvious on the face of the certificate. The words ""11 January 1996"" were so plainly both intended and actually did, on its proper construction, refer to 11 January 1997 that the day “specified” on the certificate should be understood to be 11 January 1997. Accordingly, the requirements of s15P(3)(a) were satisfied in that respect and a certificate was in force on the relevant day.  
     
      
    41    There was, in my opinion, a valid certificate under s15M. Accordingly, the relevant acts of the authorities with respect to the importation and handling of the cocaine were covered by a valid certificate, namely, the one dated 13 December 1996. 
     
      
    42    Submissions were made to the Court on the assumption that no valid s15M certificate was in operation. Her Honour considered the reasoning of the High Court in Ridgeway (supra) and applied that reasoning to the exercise of the discretion under s138 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    43    Her Honour referred to the two categories of cases identified in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson J in Ridgeway (supra) at 39: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The first category consists of cases in which the police conduct has induced an accused person to commit the offence which he or she had committed. In that category of case, the public interest in the conviction and punishment of those guilty of crime is likely to prevail over other considerations except in what we would hope to be the rare and exceptional case where the illegality or impropriety of the police conduct is grave and either so calculated or so entrenched that it is clear that considerations of public policy relating to the administration of criminal justice requires exclusion of the evidence. The other category of cases where illegal police conduct is itself the principal offence to which the charged offence is ancillary or creates or itself constitutes an essential ingredient of the charged offence ..."" 
        
       
      
    44    Her Honour also referred to the analysis in the joint judgment at 37 where their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The effective investigation by the police of some types of criminal activity may necessarily involve subterfuge, deceit and the intentional creation of opportunities for the commission by a suspect of a criminal offence. When those tactics do not involve illegal conduct, their use will ordinarily be legitimate notwithstanding that they conducive to the commission of a criminal offence by a person believed to be engaged in criminal activity. It is neither practicable nor desirable to seek to define with precision the borderline between what is acceptable and what is improper in relation to such conduct. The most that can be said is that the stage of impropriety will be reached in the case of conduct which is not illegal only in cases involving a degree of harassment or manipulation which is clearly inconsistent with minimum stands of acceptable police conduct in all the circumstances including, amongst other things, the nature and extent of any known or suspected existing or threatened criminal activity, the basis and justification of any suspicion, the difficulty of effective investigation or prevention and any imminent danger to the community. A finding that law enforcement officers have engaged in such clearly improper conduct will not, of course, suffice of itself to give rise to the discretion to exclude evidence of the alleged offences or of an element of it. As with the case of illegal conduct, the discretion will only arise if the conduct has procured the commission of the offence with which the accused is charged."" 
        
       
      
    45    Her Honour concluded that the officers were not knowingly concerned in the importation of cocaine. This finding of fact was open to her Honour. She added: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Had I formed the view that the officers had been knowingly concerned in the importation of cocaine, I am of the opinion that the illegal conduct of the officers would fall within the first category identified in  
        Ridgeway 
          
        (supra) 
         and in which the decision to admit the evidence needs to be considered against those matters contained within s138 of the Evidence Act . Without gong to the necessity of listing those factors, I am satisfied that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting it."" 
        
       
      
    46    This passage of her Honour's reasons is attacked as a mere assertion, in breach of her Honour's obligation to provide proper reasons. There is some force in this criticism. However, in the light of her Honour's outline of the facts and submissions earlier in the judgment, it is reasonably clear which are the matters which she took into account. 
     
      
    47    Her Honour was dealing with a submission to the effect but for the involvement of the officers there would have been no importation. In submissions in this Court it was suggested that her Honour fell into error and that the real question was ""Whether but for the actions of the officers the offence with which the appellant has been charged would have taken place?"" Nothing in the evidence before the trial judge, nor in this Court, suggests that any act of the informer or the undercover officers involved in this matter, played any material role in the conduct of the Appellant. The basis on which the alleged improper or illegal activity on the part of the officers could have had an effect on the involvement of the Appellant was that, without such official involvement, there would have been no importation at all. 
     
      
    48    There was an absence of precision, both before her Honour or in this Court, as to what evidence it was which ought to have been excluded. The focus of the allegations of illegality and impropriety were on the act of importation. The other matters referred to were the acquisition of chemicals needed to extract the cocaine from the plastic folders and the steps taken preparatory to extraction. However, even if all the evidence associated with the acquisition or the use of the chemicals had been excluded, that would not have fundamentally undermined the case against the Appellant who was charged with being knowingly concerned in the act of importation. In the absence of any evidence from the Appellant or anyone associated with his defence, the Court cannot speculate about what, if any, effect on his plea may have been occasioned if there had ever been a separate objection to the admissibility of evidence in relation to the acquisition of chemicals and the preparatory steps.  
     
      
    49    On the evidence before the trial judge and this Court, an informer on behalf of the National Crime Authority had engaged in a process of subterfuge with Castro-Vargas who wished to export cocaine to Australia from Colombia. The process included a number of different aspects, including the provision of addresses for the delivery of cocaine parcels, the payment of moneys, the assertion of the existence of a safe distributor, meeting agents of the exporter and the introduction of other undercover agents of the NCA who, in turn, supplied, at the request of those criminally involved, the specific chemicals required to remove the impregnated cocaine. The involvement was, in many respects, tangential and the encouragement, in so far as there was encouragement, was of a minor order. 
     
      
    50    None of the conduct complained of on behalf of the authorities in this case, in my opinion, breaches a standard of impropriety, let alone of illegality, to a significant degree, if at all. Her Honour was entitled to find, as she did find, that even without any official conduct, there would have been an importation. As the officer-in-charge of the investigation, a Mr Michael Purchas, said in his evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Cocaine was going to be sent regardless. The idea was to make sure that we associated ourselves enough with the group that we knew where it was to be sent and we were in a position to seize it and to arrest them."" 
        
       
      
    51    Her Honour was correct to find that this was the character of the involvement. The extent of the encouragement by the authorities through the informer and other involvement was, at the highest, of a low level. I am unable to discern an impropriety or contravention of Australian law to a degree which would justify the exclusion of the evidence. In the circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with her Honour's decision to balance in favour of admission, the desirability of admitting the evidence against any undesirability associated with the way in which the evidence was obtained. Accordingly, I am unable to detect undesirability to the relevant extent which would justify excluding the evidence or interfering with the exercise of the discretion under s138 by her Honour. 
     
      
    52    For these three alternative reasons - no suggestion of innocence, the s 15M certificate, the exercise of the s 138 discretion - the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Crown Appeal 
       
      
    53    I turn to the Crown appeal. Pursuant to the plea of guilty, her Honour sentenced the Respondent to the Crown appeal to a period of three and a half years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years. Her Honour's decision was handed down some two weeks before this Court issued a guideline judgment with respect to this offence R v Wong (1999) 108 A Crim R 531. However, as that judgment made clear, the Court was not laying down any new principles or standards with respect to sentencing for this offence. Rather, it affirmed the sentencing levels, for persons low in the hierarchy of an importing organisation, which had emerged from decisions both in New South Wales and the other States. Specifically, her Honour had available to her the long-standing guideline for this offence from the judgment of R v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231 as explained in subsequent judgments including R v Bernier (1998) 102 A Crim R 44. 
     
      
    54    In her reasons on sentence her Honour noted the submission made on behalf of the Appellant that his involvement was limited to translating for Romero. Nevertheless, it was understood at all times by him to be translation for the process of extracting cocaine from plastic. The Crown submission before her Honour was that the Appellant was a ""trusted adviser"" to both Romero and Cardona and, accordingly, has a more significant role in the scheme. Her Honour referred to an admission by the Appellant that, after a certain point, he became more involved in the scheme to extract the cocaine from the plastic than a mere interpreter. In the event her Honour generally accepted the version contended for by the Appellant namely: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... that he came in to assist Romero and was drawn further into the criminality in so doing."" 
        
       
      
    55    Her Honour rejected the submission that the Appellant's participation was ""vital"" to the scheme. These findings of fact were open to her Honour.  
     
      
    56    Her Honour took into account the plea of guilty, although in the circumstances, after the loss on the voir dire, a conviction was inevitable. The plea had some utilitarian value, even at that late stage. Her Honour took into account the Appellant's remorse and the limited degree of co-operation, together with his consent to the forfeiture of property under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW). Her Honour found these acts added to the expressions of contrition. Her Honour also took into account prior good character and a range of subjective considerations which are set out in her reasons on sentence. 
     
      
    57    Her Honour gave particular weight to the sentences that had, at that stage, already been imposed on the other participants in the importation and preparation of the cocaine. Romero received a sentence of eleven years with a non-parole period of six and a half years. Plainly, his involvement was of a completely different order for that which her Honour found on the part of the Appellant. In view of the fact that Romero's appeal against severity of sentence is to be heard in this Court on Friday, it is not appropriate to refer to that sentence by way of comparison for present purposes. In any event, it is concerned with an involvement of a qualitatively different character from that with which the Court is presently concerned.  
     
      
    58    Her Honour also had before her the sentences of Cardona and Robertson. In each case she indicated that their involvement had been of a higher degree of significance than that of the Appellant. She described Cardona as the agent in Australia for Castro-Vargas for the purposes of importing cocaine. She identified Robertson as active in the extraction process. Each of Cardona and Robertson had been sentenced to seven years with a non-parole period of four and a half years, the latter having been charged with supplying prohibited drugs under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). On the basis of her Honour's findings of fact, it was open to her to conclude that the objective criminality of the Appellant was ""significantly less"" than Cardona and Robertson. 
     
      
    59    The Crown appeals on the basis that the disparity between their sentences and the Appellant's sentence was, nevertheless, too great. The Crown does not point to any particular error in her Honour's reasons on sentence. The Crown relies on the proposition that the final result is manifestly inadequate. Her Honour assessed the criminality of the Appellant at a head sentence exactly half that of both Cardona and Robertson and a minimum term of less than half. 
     
      
    60    In my judgment in Wong (supra), I set out a range of sentences for the offence including for mid-range trafficable quantities in for persons low in the hierarchy in both New South Wales and in other States. (See Schedule 1.2 and Schedule 2.2 at 565 and 567). These Schedules reflect the sentences imposed on persons low in the hierarchy of an importing organisation, in a range of cases, which pre-dated her Honour's sentencing in the present case. The comparison between the sentence her Honour imposed and those contained in the Schedules shows that her Honour's Schedule is the lowest of any sentence, as to both the head sentence and the non-parole period. It is well below the range identified for offenders of this category with respect to this quantity of cocaine. The preponderance of head sentences lie in the range of six to nine years. 
     
      
    61    The usual range for a non-parole period is 60 to 70 per cent of the head sentence (see Bernier supra). In this case her Honour's non-parole period of two years was just under this relationship. In my opinion, notwithstanding her Honour's findings of fact as to the low level of involvement of the Appellant, the sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate.  
     
      
    62    The pattern of sentencing to which I have referred above, reflects the significance that is to be attached to the requirements of general deterrence with respect to importation of drugs. There is no warrant in the present circumstances, either by reason of the level of participation of the Appellant or the subjective features to which her Honour referred and which are quite unremarkable in cases of this character, for her Honour's sentence to be so out of line with the pattern of sentencing for this offence 
     
      
    63    The requirements of personal and general deterrence and the extreme adverse social effects and personal degradation occasioned by drug use, require the conclusion which her Honour also reached, that no sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate. 
     
      
    64    In re-sentencing the Appellant it is necessary to take into account the sentences of Cardona and Robertson who were involved to a greater degree than the Appellant. It is also necessary to apply the principle of double jeopardy, particularly in this case as the non-parole period for the Appellant is about to expire. Although he has known for some time of the Crown appeal, nevertheless, the fact that an increase in his period of imprisonment occurs so late in his non-parole period must increase his burden. It is for that reason that a non-parole period below the normal range of 60 to 66 per cent is appropriate.  
     
      
    65    Having regard to the particular circumstances to which I have referred, in my opinion, the sentence that should be imposed is a period of imprisonment of six years with a non-parole of three years. 
     
      
    66    NEWMAN J: I agree with the reasons advanced by the Chief Justice in relation to both the Appellant's appeal and the Crown appeal and I agree with the orders he proposed. 
     
      
    67    ADAMS J: I also agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice and with the reasons given for those orders. 
     
      
    68    SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the court are: 
     
      
       
      1 The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 
       
       
      2 The sentence imposed by the trial judge is quashed. 
       
       
      3 The respondent to the Crown appeal is sentenced to a period of imprisonment of six years. Such sentence is to commence on 9 June 1998 and expire on 9 June 2004. 
       
       
      4 A non-parole period be imposed of three years. The Respondent is eligible for release on parole on 8 June 2001. 
       
      
    69    Mr Toro-Martinez, I am required to explain to you the effect of the sentence. It will involve a term of imprisonment for three years, one more year than that imposed by the trial judge. There will be a period of three years on parole. You must honour the terms of the parole during the parole period. You are bound to be of good behaviour and to be available to comply with the conditions. If you are not of good behaviour or do not, without reasonable excuse, comply with the conditions, then the parole order may be amended or revoked and you may be arrested and be required to spend the balance of the parole period in gaol.

     TUESDAY 23 MAY 2000 
     
     REGINA v. JOHN HERBERT SCOTT 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    3   GREG JAMES, J: The appellant was convicted after a trial in the District Court of New South Wales, commencing on 13 February 1998, of supplying a prohibited drug, namely heroin, in an amount not less than the applicable commercial quantity between 1 January 1991 and 31 August 1991 at Sydney and elsewhere in the State. 
    4   He had also been charged on a count of supplying that drug between those dates in an amount which was not less than the large commercial quantity but the jury had returned a verdict of not guilty to that charge and guilty to the alternative charge to which I have referred. 
    5   His Honour had defined the offence charged for the jury as potentially including the receiving of the heroin for supply, the possession of the heroin for supply and the sale or distribution of the heroin. 
    6   The quantities of heroin alleged resulted from the accumulation of the various smaller quantities said to have been acquired by TW and the appellant, processed by them and distributed in numerous transactions. The difference between the counts lay only in the different quantities alleged. The alternative count provided for the exigency that the jury might be, as apparently occurred, not satisfied of all the dealings alleged. 
    7   The appellant now seeks to appeal against that conviction on the following grounds:- 
     
      
       
       ""1. His Honour erred by giving the jury a Jones v. Dunkel direction concerning the appellant's failure to call Khoury, Daisy Davis and Phillip Arpel. 
       
      
      
       
       2. His Honour's directions concerning the non-appearance of Khoury, Daisy Davis and Phillip Arpel were inadequate."" 
       
      
    8   The directions to which these grounds relate were not the subject of objection at the trial but were given on the application of the Crown. The Crown refers to Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. For the reasons I will later give, I consider that leave to rely on these grounds should be granted. 
    9   In its essence, the Crown case was that the accused had entered into an arrangement with one TW (who was called as a witness by the Crown) whereby the two would carry on a business of obtaining heroin from Khoury processing it and distributing it. The form of supply alleged by the Crown was thus the acquisition by the partnership of the heroin from Khoury, the having of it in possession for the purposes of supply and the distribution. 
    10   The appellant admitted an association with TW and Khoury but denied any knowing involvement in TW's heroin supplying activities. 
    11   The directions to which the grounds apply are those I now set out:- 
     
      
       
       ""Where it appears that a witness who could be expected to be able to give relevant evidence, but has not been called, you are not entitled to speculate about what he or she might have said if he or she had been called, but where that person who would be a witness is a person who in the ordinary course you would expect the Crown or the defence call and the Crown or defence offers no satisfactory explanation for its failure to call that witness you are entitled to draw the inference that his or her evidence would not have assisted the case of the Crown or the defence."" 
       
      
    12   His Honour related those directions to certain of the police officers who had not given evidence in the case and in particular to evidence of the explanations for their absence. His Honour continued:- 
     
      
       
       ""Now the Crown says that the defence has failed to call Khoury, Daisy Davis and Phillip Arkel. It is a matter for you entirely as to whether you think they are persons who would assist you, but certainly you may think that in the light of this case, bearing in mind the fact that one issue is whether Khoury was dealing in heroin and was a party to the conversations in the transcripts, and also whether Khoury, so far as the veterinary products are concerned, according to Mr. Walker, had dealings and discussions with Walker and the veterinary products. Then of course there are other ways that you might think that Mr. Khoury would be able, or could give relevant evidence. Daisy Davis is also a party referred to in the transcripts of conversations."" 
       
      
    13   His Honour then referred to whether or not the jury might consider the explanation offered by the Crown for the absence of the police officers to be satisfactory and directed them that if it was in such a case no adverse inference could be drawn and continued:- 
     
      
       
       ""What is the inference that you could draw if a witness who could be expected to be able to give relevant evidence has not been called by someone. The inference is that, that his or her evidence would not have assisted the case of that party."" 
       
      
    14   It is necessary to consider those directions in the light of the cases made by the parties and the evidence at the trial. 
    15   Prior to the appellant's trial, Khoury had been tried and convicted and TW had been dealt with for his admitted involvement. The principal evidence against the accused at his trial was that of TW although there was substantial evidence adduced of TW's involvement with Khoury in the obtaining of heroin and its re-sale. 
    16   At the trial, the appellant gave evidence dealing with the specific and detailed instances referred to by TW as showing his involvement with TW in the sale of heroin. In answer to those occasions when he had participated with TW in various meetings with Khoury and other acts including car journeys involved according to TW in the heroin supply activities he asserted that he and TW had, as far as he was concerned, participated in placing and collecting bets on Khoury's behalf with bookmakers, transported illegal veterinary products obtained with the assistance of Arkel and Brian Walker and had an involvement in dealing with car parts and motor vehicles. 
    17   In support of the account given by TW, various tape recordings of telephone conversations involving conversations between TW and Khoury or TW and Khoury's girlfriend, Daisy Davis, were tendered. In addition, there were recordings of various conversations between TW and the appellant and Khoury also tendered. 
    18   In these latter conversations, there were references to what the Crown contended was heroin and which TW contended was heroin but which the appellant asserted were references to veterinary products or the bets or car transactions to which I have referred. 
    19   There was also evidence of the finding of the paraphernalia of a heroin dealer at Khoury's residence and two storage areas to which he had access. 
    20   Surveillance evidence coupled with the taped conversations disclosed the attendances at Khoury's premises on a number of occasions by the appellant and TW and frequent telephone calls to the appellant and TW in respect of tasks Khoury was concerned that they perform. 
    21   There was evidence that on one occasion the appellant and TW were driving from Sydney to Newcastle when they were stopped by police for a traffic violation, a quantity of heroin was located within the car. It was the Crown case that this quantity of heroin was referred to in the intercepted conversations and in particular that it was discussed between TW and Khoury in a conversation of 13 June 1991. Also, the appellant admitted knowing of TW's criminal record (or at least some of it) evidencing his involvement with heroin. 
    22   Although the conversations to which TW and Khoury were party on many occasions clearly refer to heroin and drug deals, the conversations to which the appellant was party or those portions of the conversations between TW and Khoury in which it can be independently proved the appellant participated, at least, at the time he participated, do not unequivocally establish, intrinsically, that the subject matter of the conversation was heroin. 
    23   The intercepted telephone communications make it clear that Davis, the girlfriend of Sam Khoury, who was herself party to a number of the conversations, had knowledge of what was occurring at least between Khoury and TW. She was said, by TW, to have been present on occasions when Sam Khoury supplied heroin to the appellant and to TW. In addition, she is said to have herself assisted in that supply on occasions in particular physically providing the heroin found in the motor vehicle when the appellant and TW were arrested. TW also gave evidence that Arkel was present on five or six occasions when Khoury provided heroin to TW and indeed was said to be the or one of Khoury's sources for the heroin. The appellant denied any knowledge of any role Arkel may have had in relation to heroin dealing. 
    24   In his case, the appellant, as well as giving evidence himself, called Brian Walker who confirmed an association between Khoury and the appellant and that the appellant had delivered veterinary products to him. He further confirmed that the appellant and TW would collect the veterinary products from Khoury and pay to Khoury money provided by the witness to TW. He said this had occurred on three or four occasions during the relevant period and that in the main TW was involved in the supply of the veterinary products rather than the appellant although the appellant had attended on some of the occasions. 
    25   An acceptance of the thrust of TW's evidence was thus critical to proof of the appellant's guilt. As the Crown in its written submissions put the matter:- 
     
      
       
       ""The fundamental issue for the jury was whether there was a sufficient basis for accepting TW's evidence. If the jury did accept it, then the case against the appellant was overwhelming."" 
       
      
    26   For the Crown to succeed in the present trial it was necessary the jury be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's involvement with TW in dealings in the heroin in sufficient quantities to accumulate to the amount charged. It was logically necessary in those circumstances that the jury reject the appellant's account denying knowing involvement. It was necessary for the jury to accept so much of TW's evidence as inculpated the appellant. TW's credit was thus very much in issue as was the appellant's on the essential question of whether the appellant was knowingly involved in the illegal activities of TW, Khoury, Davis and Arkel. On this issue the evidence does not disclose any association between the appellant and Khoury, Davis and Arkel, otherwise than either by way of involvement in the heroin dealing as asserted by the Crown or alternatively by way of involvement as the appellant asserted. 
    27   His Honour had directed the jury in his summing up that the evidence of TW, taken not in isolation but in context, was crucial to the Crown's contentions that if the whole of the evidence was looked at, the conversations between TW and Khoury, the appellant and Khoury, between Davis and the appellant and between Khoury and the appellant's girlfriend or fiancee, in the context of the appellant's and TW's actions, only make sense if TW and the appellant were acting in concert for the asserted criminal purpose in their dealings with Khoury. That is, that what was spoken about in the relevant conversations was in fact heroin and not, as the appellant had described it, bets, betting, veterinary products, car parts or motor vehicles. 
    28   The appellant was vigorously cross-examined at the trial about his asserted lack of knowledge and his asserted purpose in dealing with Khoury and TW. He was cross-examined about the statement he had provided to the police on the occasion of the vehicle having been stopped and the heroin found, his knowledge of TW's prior criminal record and use of heroin, his involvement with Khoury, racing, bets and the transmission of the veterinary products and the contents of the telephone conversations to which he was party. In particular, he was cross-examined as to portions of those conversations to which the Crown had attributed particular significance. As to certain of those portions, there was controversy over the accuracy of the interpretation of what had been said. The appellant asserted an innocent content or that the reference was to the illegal veterinary products. He was cross-examined concerning a video tape taken of Khoury and Davis digging up an object and whether that occasion was the same occasion on which Khoury supplied TW with some material identified by TW as heroin. He asserted that on one occasion dug up veterinary products had been provided by Khoury. The cross-examination included putting to him a video tape which the Crown contended showed Khoury placing or dropping a quantity of heroin into the Alfa motor vehicle, that is, providing it to TW at a time when he was present.  
    29   The cross-examination itself on a full reading does not resolve the issue posed at the trial even when taken in conjunction with a reading of the transcripts of the intercepted telephone conversations provided on the hearing of the appeal by the Crown. Although those transcripts were challenged by counsel for the appellant in some respects as including material more adverse to the appellant than the true contents of the tape recordings would warrant, for this purpose I have considered them as representing the Crown case taken at its highest. I have therefore not needed to determine as a fact (even if it would have been open to me to do so) those contents from the audio tapes which were in evidence at the trial. 
    30   In order to ascertain the effect of the challenged directions, I have considered the evidence of TW in the light of those transcripts and in the context of the whole of the evidence in the case. 
    31   Prior to or during the summing up, the Crown Prosecutor made the application to the trial judge that the jury should be directed according to the principles in Jones v. Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 concerning the absence of the evidence of Khoury, Davis, his fiancee, and a person Arkel in the defence case. It may have been that this application was made in the context of a defence application concerning the absence of evidence from certain police officers. His Honour gave the directions I have set out. 
    32   His Honour had given the customary directions concerning onus and standard of proof and had adequately directed the jury otherwise that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the elements of the offence and that, in this case, on the evidence of TW and the movements and activities of the appellant and the contents of the intercepted telephone conversations. He had directed the jury as to inferences and given the general directions as to consideration of the credibility of witnesses. His Honour had given a strong direction to the jury concerning the evidence of TW in circumstances in which he was an accomplice in the offence charged. His Honour's summing up made it perfectly clear to the jury that on the Crown case Khoury, Davis and Arkel were complicit in the crimes of supply and in particular whether complicit in the crime charged or not, complicit with TW in the heroin distribution enterprise. No assistance was given to the jury on the question of determining who they might think should have called the witnesses, if anyone. 
    33   Notwithstanding the conclusion of his Honour's directions on the way in which the jury might reason as to absent witnesses where he advised the jury that they might think it more appropriate to approach the determination of the case without speculating upon what might have been the content of the evidence of the missing witnesses, in my view, the directions the Crown sought and his Honour gave in this regard in the context of the competing accounts at this trial was seriously in error and such as to undermine the onus of proof. 
    34   To suggest it was open to conclude that the evidence of those persons would not have assisted the case of the appellant was such as to divert the jury. To suggest that they might consider that the appellant should have called those witnesses was entirely wrong. On the Crown case, the witnesses were criminally complicit with the appellant. On the defence case, they, if they were heroin suppliers, had manipulated and deceived the appellant. The Crown's reluctance or inability to call them was not elucidated but the explanation for their absence in the Crown case may have been reasonable. It was not reasonable to suggest that in any way those witnesses should have been called in the appellant's case. The prospect that the jury might, from their absence, think that their evidence might not have assisted the accused's case was, at the least, seriously confusing if not inevitable. 
    35   The so-called ""Jones v. Dunkel"" direction, on an analysis is often of little assistance in criminal trials and in any event, when such a direction is applied to an accused in a case in which the Crown bears the onus, is likely to undermine that onus. In a succession of cases, including The Queen v. Buckland (1977) 2 NSWLR 452; Regina v. Newland (1997-98) 98 A. Crim. R. 455); OGD (1997) 45 NSWLR 744 at 753 and Regina v. Taufua [1999] NSWCCA 205, although the Court of Criminal Appeal had recognised that in an appropriate case such a direction might be given, emphasis had been placed on the caution with which the giving of such a direction should be approached and of the necessity for precision and care in the direction itself when it is given. In Newland (supra), the court had identified the problem in the context of an asserted failure to call an accomplice and the obligation which would thereby have arisen had the accomplice been called to warn the jury of possible unreliability in the application of s.165 of the Evidence Act. 
    36   In Newland (supra), where only four people were in a position to give direct evidence of the guilt or innocence of the accused, one was called - an accomplice - and the others were not, although they were accomplices. Their Honours reached a view that what was called for was not a Jones v. Dunkel direction but an instruction to the jury to refrain from speculating. 
    37   In Taufua (supra), where a Jones v. Dunkel direction was given in favour of the Crown in respect of the failure by the appellant to call an alleged accomplice and a person who it was alleged had agreed to cover for the appellant and falsely confess to the armed robbery in question, Carruthers, J. reviewed views taken in this court on the direction, particularly in the context of what had recently been said by the majority of the High Court in Weissensteiner v. The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217. His Honour concluded that it was quite inappropriate for the judge to have left to the jury the question of whether the asserted accomplice should have been called by the appellant. He considered although there may have been no obligation upon the Crown to call the witness to prove the admission by conduct in the accused seeking to have him falsely confess to the crime, there were simply too many complicating factors to allow a just conclusion by the jury that the appellant should have called him. It was the Crown that introduced into the trial that man's involvement. The Crown could hardly, in those circumstances, expect the defence to assume the burden of calling him. His Honour concluded that such expectation would ""involve an inversion of the onus of proof"". 
    38   His Honour drew attention to the adversarial nature of criminal proceedings but the overriding importance of the presumption of innocence and the right to silence. He said:- 
     
      
       
       ""In these circumstances, the giving of the Jones v. Dunkel directions against an accused person can be fraught with danger."" 
       
      
    39   Both James, J. and Barr, J. agreed. 
    40   Subsequently, the High Court of Australia in RPS v. The Queen [2000] HCA 3 considered the special circumstances of when it is appropriate for a trial judge, following the passing of the Evidence Act, to comment on the accused having failed to give evidence and also considered the more general circumstance of the giving of a Jones v. Dunkel direction. 
    41   In the judgment of the majority comprising Gaudron, ACJ., Gummow, Kirby and Hayne, JJ. appears the following:- 
     
      
       
       ""In a criminal trial, not only is an accused person not bound to give evidence, it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The observations by the court in Jones v. Dunkel must not be applied in criminal cases without taking account of those considerations. 
       
      
      
       
       If the question concerns the calling by the defence of a witness other than the accused, it will also be necessary to recall that the prosecutor 'has the responsibility of ensuring that the Crown case is presented with fairness to the accused' and in many cases would be expected to call the witness in question as part of the case for the prosecution. And, if the question concerns the failure of the prosecution to call a witness whom it might have been expected to call, the issue is not whether the jury may properly reach conclusions about issues of fact but whether, in the circumstances, the jury should entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused. 
       
      
      
       
       With these propositions in mind, it is necessary to say something of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales in  
       Regina v. OGD 
        which, as we understand it, has been taken to be authority for charging juries in the way in which the trial judge did in this case. It may be doubted that, properly understood,  
       OGD 
        stands for a general proposition that, in cases like the present, directions can or should be given to the effect of those that were given here. In his reasons for judgment in  
       OGD 
       , Gleeson, CJ. emphasised the need for caution before giving such directions. But if, contrary to the view we have expressed about  
       OGD 
       , that case is to be taken as establishing, as a general proposition, that it is proper in cases similar to the present to give directions of the kind given here, it should be overruled."" 
       
      
    42   RPS (supra) was heard and decided subsequent to this trial and the judgment delivered only shortly prior to the appeal being argued. 
    43   In my view, the absence of an objection was explicable in the light of views prevailing at the time, but the giving of these direction was a serious error, occasioning in the circumstances of this case, a miscarriage of justice. 
    44   It was urged upon us by the Crown that we should refuse leave pursuant to Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules or apply the proviso to s.6 of the Criminal Appeal Act in the absence of objection of trial. 
    45   True it is that it does not appear that at the time the challenged directions were given objection was taken by trial counsel for the appellant but it is not clear that there was any such examination of whether such a direction should have been given in this trial as was referred to by Gleeson, CJ. at Regina v. OGD (supra):- 
     
      
       
       ""As a practical matter, it will often be prudent for a trial judge, before giving directions which include a  
       Jones v. Dunkel 
        direction to raise with counsel, in the absence of the jury, the question whether such a direction should be given. That would give counsel an opportunity to suggest to the judge possible reasons for the accused's silence (or the failure to call a witness) which may not have occurred to the judge, and to debate the fairness of the direction."" 
       
      
    46   It does not appear to me that it is appropriate to apply the proviso to a direction which might have the effect of seriously undermining the onus on the Crown. In addition, it was the Crown which positively sought a direction which, in my view, was erroneous in law. I consider the mis-direction fundamentally affected the appellant's right to a fair trial. Further, since it would have operated or could have operated so as to divert attention from the assessment of the credibility of TW's evidence in the light of the denials on oath and the credibility of the appellant, I am unable to say that ""an appropriately instructed jury acting reasonably on the evidence before them and applying the correct onus and standard of proof, would inevitably have convicted the accused"": (Wilde v. Regina (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 372). Having regard to what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Taufua (supra) and the High Court in RPS (supra), I would hold that this trial miscarried, resulting in a serious miscarriage of justice. Rule 4 cannot apply. 
    47   I propose the following: that leave to appeal be granted; the appeal be upheld; the convictions quashed and a new trial ordered.

     Regina v Geoffrey Warwick FOWLER 
    The appellant was convicted of the murder of his brother in law, following a retrial. He appealed against the conviction (but not against sentence) on the grounds that the trial judge had erred; (1) in rejecting certain defence evidence; (2) in the direction concerning witness, Bradley Walsh; (3) in failing to give sufficient directions concerning (a) the identification of the various firearms, (b) motive, (c) the need for a McKinney direction or warning under s165 Evidence Act 1995, (d) accessory after the fact; (4) in refusing to provide the jury with a transcript of the trial; (5) in the directions concerning lies (6) in granting leave to cross examine two witnesses under s38 of the Evidence Act 1995; (7) in giving the Weissensteiner direction.HELD (allowing the appeal) :Ground 1: rejection of defence evidence(1) The trial judge was correct in rejecting the photographic evidence. There was no probative value in the evidence, and the tender was likely to lead to a false issue.(2) Evidence that the appellant had seen the deceased in a distressed state several months prior to his death and that the distressed state may have resulted from evidence of bullet holes in the car lacked probative value and was correctly rejected. Ground 2: directions concerning Bradley WalshThe direction given by the trial judge was sufficient in that it brought to the jury’s attention, the need to treat Bradley Walsh’s evidence with care because of his conviction for interfering with a witness in another matter and his concession that he had lied to a detective. Rule 4 applied.Ground 3: omissions in the summing up(a) The identification of various firearms was only of peripheral relevance.(b) Although the direction concerning motive was correct in law, it was preferable to explain that motive was a matter relied upon by the Crown as a strand in a circumstantial case, which would be supportive if made out, or if not made out, would be neutral. In this case, it was not necessary to establish motive beyond reasonable doubt. However, the further direction which referred to essential and non-essential circumstances, once given, should either have been followed by further explanation or withdrawn.Penney (1998) 155 ALR 605; Plevac (1999) NSW CCA 351 applied(c) The Crown case did not depend upon the record of interview to provide a confession of guilt, and so no McKinney direction or warning under s165 Evidence Act was required.(d) The direction given in regard to accessory after the fact was appropriate.Ground 4: refusal to provide the jury with a transcript of the trialCaution should be taken when allowing the jury access to the trial transcript pursuant to s 55C of the Jury Act 1977. It is preferable, especially in long trials, for the relevant evidence to be adequately identified in the summing up, or read, or the relevant pages provided ensuring that any matter not received in their presence is removed.Ground 5: Directions concerning liesThe direction in the instant case was erroneous in that it failed to sufficiently reproduce what was said in Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193, it did not adequately explain that the Crown is required to show that the lie was a deliberate falsehood, it did not identify what was the material issue to which the lies were said to relate, it risked reversing the onus of proof, and it concluded with the erroneous direction that any lie told by the accused may be taken as a consciousness of guilt. Heyde (1990) 20 NSWLR 234 and Qian Li Zhen (1995) 83 A Crim R 575 applied.Ground 6: Leave to cross examine witnesses under s38 of the Evidence Act(1) Section 38 should be given its full effect, and should not be limited to situations where a party calling a witness is confronted unexpectedly by unfavourable evidence, where the witness unexpectedly gives evidence that is inconsistent with prior statements or where the witness unexpectedly appears not to be making a genuine attempt to give evidence.Souleyman (1996) 40 NSWLR 712 Gilbert Adam 47 NSWLR 267 applied(2) The case of Blewitt is no longer applicable in cases like the present, being a case decided prior to the Evidence Act 1995(3) There was no error in granting leave, however, once leave is granted pursuant to s38, and assessment is made that the witness’s evidence is likely to be neutral, ss135 and 137 of the Evidence Act should be taken into account. If the witnesses are called at a retrial, it will then be incumbent on the trial judge to direct the jury that any lies told by witnesses go only to the issue of credibility, and cannot be used to support the Crown case. The absence of such a direction risked a miscarriage of justice. Blewwit (1988) 62 ALJR 503, Jones v Dunkel (1958) 75 WN (NSW) 358 , Apostilides (1984) 154 CLR 563, Whitehorn (1983) 152 CLR 657, Kneebone (1999) NSWCCA 279 considered.Ground 7: The Weissensteiner direction(1) This was not a case in which a Weissensteiner direction was appropriate. Such a direction should be confined to exceptional cases, where the chain of reasoning is of the kind there involved. In the instant case, the appellant had provided answers to at least some of the matters in his unsworn statement, to other matters his evidence could not have risen above a denial, and there were tactical reasons, such as fear of self incrimination, as to why the appellant would not have given evidence.(2) Even if this were a case where a Weissensteiner direction was appropriate, the directions were deficient in that the appellant had not been silent on each matter and the trial judge did not sufficiently identify what it was that the appellant had said in relation to each matter. This was compounded by the reference to the absence of a denial on oath or in the “dock statement” which should be avoided.Bell (CCA NSW 31 May 1985), RPS 2000 HCA 3, OGD (1997) 45 NSWLR 744, Bargwanna (CCA NSW 15 June 1998) consideredGround 8: Unsafe and unsatisfactory verdictThe evidence amounted to a powerful circumstantial case, and it could not be said that the jury would have entertained a reasonable doubt, so as to support a quashing of the conviction.ORDERS PROPOSED:(1) Appeal allowed(2) Conviction and sentence quashed(3) New trial ordered

     Regina v Geoffrey Warwick FOWLER 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   WOOD CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted on 4 June 1997, following a retrial, of the murder of his brother in law, Trevor John Climpson. He now appeals against that conviction, but not against the sentence that was imposed. 
     
      
     FACTS 
      
    2   The deceased was shot and killed during the evening of 8 January 1988, outside a house at Lot 2, Villiers Road, Cecil Park, premises at which he had been living with his wife, Vikki Climpson, a sister of the appellant, until a date about six weeks before his death. 
    3   When police arrived at the Cecil Park premises shortly before 11pm, they found the deceased face down on the ground in a crouched position, beside his motor vehicle. He had been struck by three bullets. One bullet consistent with a .357 or .38 projectile passed through the left side of his chest. Another shot consistent with a .22 projectile passed through his left loin, and a third shot, also consistent with a .357 or .38 projectile, struck him in the back of the skull. 
    4   A fired .22 calibre cartridge case with the marking “H”, was located near an aluminium shed a few metres from his body. Upon the Crown case it was the source of the .22 projectile that passed through the loin of the deceased. A spent .38 calibre bullet was found on the ground near the position of his head. Another .38 calibre bullet, the cause of the chest wound, was extracted from his body during a post mortem examination. The remaining .22 projectile was not found, despite a careful sweep of the area by army officers with metal detectors on 18 January. 
    5   Dr. Oettle came to the conclusion that the evidence suggested that the first shot had been fired from the passenger side of the car, that the body of the deceased had been moved artificially into the position in which it was found by police, and that he had been shot in the head after he had died from the earlier wounds. Dr. Malouf, however, was of the opinion that the first shot struck the deceased in his chest, causing him to fall, that the second shot struck him in the head, and that the other shot struck him in the loin. 
    6   When the Cecil park premises were searched, a .22 calibre Stirling rifle (Ex R) and a .22 calibre magazine, were found inside the house. Additionally, a .22 calibre Ruger pistol, in a pouch (Ex A), which was normally carried by the deceased, was found hidden in a washing basket in the main bedroom. 
    7   At the Westmead mortuary, a .22 calibre Bartram pistol (Ex U) containing four .22 calibre rounds, and two empty cartridge cases, was removed from the pocket of the shirt that the deceased had been wearing. A number of other firearms owned by him were later found by police at the Plough & Harrow, the stock feed, saddlery and riding school business where he had been working and living.  
    8   At the time of the shooting, the appellant, who was normally resident at Moree, was visiting his parents at Wallacia. His son, Adam Fowler, who had accompanied him to Sydney, gave evidence that the appellant went out during the storm and power failure that occurred during the evening of 8 January, events which it was agreed occurred between 8.15pm. and 9.30pm. The appellant returned, he said, some time after a Sherlock Holmes movie screened that night on television, had concluded. It was established that this movie was screened between 8.30pm. and 11.08pm. 
    9   Another witness, Debra Dickson gave evidence of seeing the appellant arrive at the Cecil Park premises where she kept some horses, some time after 9.30pm. This occurred as she was leaving. Beyond saying “Hi” to him, there was no conversation between them. The appellant, she agreed, made no attempt to conceal himself. She made no mention of seeing anyone else in his company. 
    10   Vicki Climpson, who was given a certificate under S 128 Evidence Act, said in chief that the deceased had moved out of their home about six weeks before his death, because of arguments about building a home on her parent’s property. She added, however, that he had returned to the house nightly, and had stayed over on some nights, including the night before his murder, but he was not living there permanently. She had last seen him at the house alive at 10.30pm on 7 January, and had last spoken to him by telephone at about 7.00pm. on the night of his death. 
    11   Pursuant to the leave granted under S 38 of the Evidence Act, she was cross examined by the Crown Prosecutor as to whether the evidence she had given concerning the deceased staying over, and spending the night before his death, at her home, was untrue, in the light of the statements she had made to police and in her record of interview. In the course of this cross examination it became obvious that these prior statements were, to various extents, inconsistent with her evidence at the trial. She agreed, in the course of this cross examination, that she had asked Kevin Bell to lie to police about the movements of the deceased on the afternoon and evening of the shooting, and about the phone call said to have been made by the deceased at about 7.00pm.  
    12   When giving evidence in chief, she said that, on 7 January, the deceased had placed the .22 calibre pistol (Ex A) in the clothes basket in her bedroom because he wanted her and the children to be safe. This he said he had done, according to her, because Bradley Walsh was causing trouble, following an altercation with him when he had allegedly molested her daughter.  
    13   Pursuant to leave given under S 38, the Crown Prosecutor put to her that this was untrue, and that the weapon was placed in the basket after the deceased was shot. In the course of the cross examination that ensued, she acknowledged that she had not mentioned the placing of the pistol in the basket to police. Rather, she had said to them that, on 8 January, the deceased had told her “They can try all they like, they won’t get me, I’ve got Percy with me”. She had added in this statement, “I knew what he meant … (it) .. was that he had his revolvers with him. He used to carry an automatic .22 calibre pistol with him”. She denied, however, that in this passage she had been referring to the weapon found in the clothes basket. 
    14   In chief, she identified the Bartram pistol found in the shirt pocket as his, and said that the deceased also kept a Browning pistol and another pistol in his maroon bag. Additionally, she said that he had been accustomed to carrying another pistol strapped to his leg, which he called “Percy”. She said that he carried large sums of money in the sports bag. She was cross examined by the Crown concerning this evidence, and concerning the answers previously given as to the various weapons the deceased had owned, and in particular as to whether they were carried on his person or kept locked away. The obvious intent was to point out inconsistencies in her accounts and to place in issue her evidence that the deceased was carrying a pistol on his leg at the time of his death, and that he had two concealed weapons in his sports bag. It was the fact that no weapon was found strapped to the leg of the deceased when his body was examined, and his brother said that he did not have the practice of carrying a weapon this way. 
    15   The witness Anita Usope said, because she had been “stoned” she was unable to remember anything about the night of 8 February 1988, apart from being taken to the hospital and to the police station. This witness was similarly given a certificate under S 128 of the Evidence Act. Leave was sought by the Crown to cross examine her under S 38(1)(b) of the Act, upon the basis that she was not making a genuine attempt to give evidence, but that was refused. 
    16   She said she had no recollection of Vikki Climpson complaining to her about being mistreated by the deceased. She said that she had seen a handgun in a pouch, lying on top of washing in a clothes basket, a couple of days before the shooting. That weapon, she added, she had seen in that position on a few prior occasions. She recognised it, and the pistol found in the deceased’s pocket, as his.  
    17   Kathleen Lancaster (nee Van-Derzyden) with whom the deceased had been having an affair, agreed, after cross examination by the Crown, pursuant to leave given under S 38(1)(c) of the Evidence Act, that their association had continued for nine years or so, and that she had been visited by him most evenings. She said that he had come to her home at about 7.30 pm and had left there about 10.30pm on the night that he was shot. She said that the excuse which the deceased had given to his wife for his evening absences, while he visited her, was that he had been going “to the dogs”. 
    18   She said that shortly after his death she had discovered $17,000 in a toiletry bag that belonged to the deceased. It emerged from her cross examination, and from the evidence of Virginia Amore, that a brother of the deceased Robert Climpson, subsequently accused her of stealing this money from a safe kept at the premises of the Plough & Harrow, of which he, Robert Climpson was the owner and the deceased was the manager. 
    19   Robert Climpson said that, in 1987, the deceased had asked him if he could move a caravan onto the site of the Plough & Harrow because he and his wife were “blueing”. He confirmed that the deceased was accustomed to carry on his person or behind the seat squab of his utility, the .22 Ruger pistol (Ex A), and that he had kept other weapons in a safe and gun cupboard at the Plough & Harrow. 
    20   He said that he and the deceased had counted the day’s takings, amounting to $19,800 which were placed in the safe, during the afternoon on the day on which he was shot. He said that when the deceased left those premises later that day, he was carrying the Ruger pistol (Ex A) with him. 
    21   When he looked in the safe, after the shooting, he found that the $19,800 was missing. He said that when he confronted Kathleen Lancaster, with the allegation that she had taken the money, she replied that it was the deceased’s money but that she would split it with him (a matter which she denied when it was put to her). He later estimated that approximately $300,000 had gone missing from the business. He was suspicious that she had taken the money but did not believe that the deceased had done so. He acknowledged, however, that he had made a contrary suggestion to the police in January 1990. 
    22   He recognised the Bartram revolver, which he thought was used for shooting rats, as having belonged to the deceased, but said that he had never seen him with a Browning pistol, nor with a pistol strapped to his leg. He had seen him with a red bag, but did not know if he used it to carry money. He was unaware of what the deceased had been doing in the evenings, or of his affair with Ms Lancaster. 
    23   The appellant’s brother, Gregory Fowler, who was called in the defence case, said that the appellant came to his home early in the morning following the shooting, with his son. He appeared to be “his normal jocular self.” When a telephone call came through with the news that the deceased had been killed, the appellant’s reaction, he said, appeared to have been one of absolute shock. This witness said that, on the afternoon of 8 January, he had seen the deceased place a small firearm in his maroon sports bag. When he asked him about it the deceased said, “don’t ask, don’t get involved”. He said that he had never seen any signs of injuries to Vikki Climpson during the period over which she had lived with the deceased. 
    24   Between six and twelve months earlier he said that he had seen bullet holes in one of the vehicles owned by the deceased. He did not, however, speak to him about those holes. 
    25   A friend of the deceased Jeffrey Williams who was also called in the defence case, similarly gave evidence of having seen bullet holes in a vehicle of the deceased. Williams advised the deceased to report it to police, but he said that he could take care of it himself. In 1985, the deceased had informed him that he was in fear for his life and asked if he could obtain a pistol or gun for him. He refused. Later the deceased said that he had joined a gun club and had obtained a small handgun. 
    26   The deceased’s daughter Lila Climpson, who was similarly called in the defence case, said that she had not seen any violence between her parents. Her father, she said, was accustomed to carrying a pistol. He also kept a rifle in the house. She also gave evidence of her mother arguing physically with Bradley Walsh at a time when it was alleged that he had behaved inappropriately in the presence of some children. 
    27   When the appellant was interviewed by police on 21 January 1988, he said that he had not seen the deceased since the previous November or December. He had not discussed with his sister their separation, and she had never expressed any concerns to him about her own safety. He said that he had never had a disagreement or falling out with the deceased, and described their relationship as good. 
    28   He said to police, in this interview, that he had never owned a pistol but acknowledged that he had once owned a .22 calibre Lithgow rifle, and a .222 rifle which he had sold at the beginning of 1987. 
    29   He said that he had been to Vikki Climpson’s house during the day of 8 January, but had left those premises at about 6pm to have dinner with his parents. He had returned to Cecil Park a little later that night, but had left when a woman named Debbie, said that Vikki was asleep. It was his account, in this interview, that he had arrived back at his parents’ home shortly after 10.00pm. 
    30   Following this interview police searched his home at Moree, but found no firearms in those premises. 
    31   On 19 September 1990, police returned to Moree for the purpose of making a further search of the appellant’s home. The appellant and Bradley Walsh were present.  
    32   The appellant waited in the lounge room while police searched that room. When he stood up and walked away, Detective Keen searched the chair on which he had been sitting. He found a shortened .357 calibre magnum Armi-Jager carbine (Ex Z) hidden under a cushion. The appellant, when questioned about this weapon, said that a truck driver had left it there two or three months earlier, saying that he would pick it upon his way back from Brisbane. He added that he had not seen or spoken to that person since. 
    33   When Walsh’s bedroom was searched, a .22 calibre Stirling automatic rifle with a telescopic sight (Ex H) was found concealed between the mattress and bed base. Walsh informed police that he had purchased the weapon about 8 weeks earlier from someone at an hotel. When he was asked about the weapon, in the course of an interview that day, the appellant said that it belonged to Bradley Walsh, although he did not know where he had obtained it. At the trial he admitted that he now knew this to be incorrect. 
    34   On 12 October 1990, the appellant’s home was searched again by police. On this occasion a small box containing a number of .38 and .357 calibre bullets was located inside a freezer. Unlike other items in the freezer, the box was free of frost. Police involved in the search, however, rejected the proposition put in cross examination, that it had been “planted” by them to assist the Crown case. 
    35   On 22 September 1993, the Moree premises which were no longer owned by the appellant, were searched yet again by police. On this occasion, police found a hole in the floor and carpet, and also the remains of a spent copper jacketed projectile (Ex KK) underneath a damaged floorboard in the dining room. This evidence was pressed upon the basis that it tended to negate any suggestion by the appellant (as was made in an intercepted telephone conversation with his wife) that the weapon found at Moree had been ‘planted’ by police, and upon the further basis that it was available to prove a lie, on the part of the appellant, as to the manner in which the .357 magnum found at Moree came to be there. 
    36   Ian Climpson, the son of the deceased, gave evidence that they had been living together in a caravan on the Plough & Harrow property for about five weeks before the killing. The deceased had informed him that he had moved out of his home because of constant arguments with his wife. However, he had never himself seen bruises on Vikki Climpson and she had not complained to him about being mistreated by the deceased. His father, he said, had spent the night of 7 January in the caravan (and not with his wife). On the night of the shooting he had last seen him at about 8pm. 
    37   He confirmed that the deceased had owned some rifles as well as the pistol that was found in the clothes basket. This weapon he said was normally carried by his father in a pouch but was also, on occasions, kept in a pull down section of the bench seat in the utility. He was unaware of the deceased owning any other pistols, and specifically said that he had not seen the Bartram pistol before. 
    38   The .22 calibre Stirling rifle found hidden under the mattress at the appellant’s Moree home, on 19 September 1990, he said had been purchased by the deceased about two months before his death, and had been used by the deceased, by himself and by Bradley Walsh to shoot rabbits.  
    39   He said that the deceased had told him that there had been a dispute between Vikki Climpson and Bradley Walsh, but had made no mention of leaving his pistol with her for protection. He had been unaware of any relationship between his father and Ms Lancaster. 
    40   Michael Clarke said that the appellant often visited the property at which he worked from mid 1987, at Weemala, to go shooting with him. It was his recollection that the appellant had a .223 mini Ruger semi automatic rifle, and a .222 bolt action rifle. Around June 1989 he had also seen him with two .357 Magnum pistols. In about July 1989, the appellant had asked him if he could leave his weapons locked up on his property because his boys were starting to play with them. The appellant had also instructed him not to show them to anyone. 
    41   The two pistols, he said, remained on his property until February 1990 when he returned them to the appellant. One he identified as the pistol found in the lounge chair. In October 1990, he handed police a number of cartridges cases (Ex BB) that had been fired with this weapon. He also identified the box of ammunition that had been found in the freezer, as one that had been brought to his property by the appellant. The appellant, he said, had often visited his property with relatives, including Gus Harb, to go shooting. 
    42   The appellant’s former wife, Noella Harb, gave evidence that she had lived with the appellant from 1985 to 1990 at Moree, where they operated the Disco Donuts business. During that period she said he had kept a number of rifles in the house. Although she said that the .22 Stirling with the telescopic sight found under the bed, was “very” similar to one owned by the appellant, it was conceded that she had previously informed police that she had never seen the appellant with such a weapon. 
    43   It was her evidence that, in 1986 or 1987, the appellant had purchased two pistols, one of which was the .357 Magnum found in the lounge chair, after driving to Newcastle or Singleton one night. She agreed that she had previously informed police that she did not know where the appellant had acquired this weapon. 
    44   She also gave evidence that three to four months before the shooting, Vikki Climpson rang their house one night. Following a conversation with the appellant, he told her that the deceased was mistreating his sister, drugging her tea and injecting her with drugs. She said that he had appeared to be quite distraught after this conversation. 
    45   Following the shooting she said that the appellant returned to Moree and removed the guns from the house, “just in case the police turn up”. At the earlier trial she gave a somewhat different account, her evidence, it was conceded, then being that she thought that the appellant had said that he wanted the firearms out of the house, because he did not have a licence. Some of the weapons she said the appellant had placed in a car they kept in a storage shed away from the property. When police came to speak to the appellant she said that he had quietly instructed her not to ”tell them about the shed”. 
    46   An intercepted telephone conversation between the appellant and this witness on 24 September 1990, was placed into evidence. In it, the appellant remarked that the police had raided his house and were trying to pin the murder on him “because they’ve turned up some weapons in the house that I have never seen before in my life”. When the conversation turned to the Magnum, and whether he had got rid of “those,” the appellant cautioned his wife that “telephones have ears”. Later in the conversation he suggested that the police had planted the pistol and rifle in his house. 
    47   In cross examination she agreed, after having been given a certificate under S 128 of the Evidence Act, that before leaving the appellant, she had falsified the books of their business, Disco Donuts, and had extracted money from it. She conceded that she had been arguing with him over her proper entitlement to a wage, and over her fair share of profits from the business. She denied, however, that she had been filled by bitterness towards him in July 1990, the time at which she left him, and the time at which she was interviewed by police. She denied inventing her evidence to ensure that the appellant did not have access to their children. 
    48   Ronald Doran, a former friend of the appellant, said that, in late 1986, the appellant had informed him that his sister Vikki was having a hard time with her husband and that he would have to do something about him. Doran asked if he would belt the man up? The appellant replied that something more serious was needed, and that he “should be done in”. The appellant offered him $10,000 to accompany him to Sydney, for that purpose. Doran refused. The appellant, he said, brought the subject up again a little later, when he said that he was going to Sydney to “sort (his) brother in law out”. Doran again refused to assist. 
    49   He agreed in cross examination that he had not mentioned the offer of money when giving evidence at the first trial. He explained that he had feared for his safety. He denied making the evidence up. 
    50   Bradley Walsh was called by the Crown. A certificate was given to this witness under S 128 of the Evidence Act, at the Crown’s request, in anticipation of the possibility that he might give evidence incriminatory of himself in relation to a variety of offences including perjury, accessory after the fact to murder, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, concealment of serious offences, indecent assault, and firearms offences. When asked about the matter, he claimed to have no recollection of the events at Moree, or of the events of which he had given evidence at the first trial, or even of having given evidence on that occasion. 
    51   Leave was sought and given to the Crown to cross examine him under S 38(1)(b)of the Evidence Act concerning that evidence. In the course of that cross examination, it was conceded that he had said at the first trial that, a week before the police search on 19 September 1990, he had seen a .22 calibre rifle under a wooden pallet in the backyard of the appellant’s home in Moree; that the appellant had said that he did not have a shooter’s licence, and that he had then hidden the weapon under his bed. 
    52   It was also conceded that he had given evidence of a “man from the pub” leaving a .357 Magnum handgun at the premises a few days before 19 September 1990, which had been accidentally discharged by him towards the floor, after which the appellant had taken it to his bedroom. 
    53   It was further conceded that Walsh had said that, prior to the police search, the appellant had been “running around” panicking, and had placed the handgun under the lounge chair, and that he (Walsh) had offered to cover the rifle with his own shooter’s licence, and had later produced that licence to police. It was also conceded that he had said, at the first trial, that his assertion as to ownership of the rifle, to the police, had been an attempt to help the appellant. 
    54   During his cross examination by Dr Woods QC (as he then was), this witness attributed his memory problems to a series of open heart operations. 
    55   The appellant made an unsworn statement in which he denied having been responsible for the killing, and also denied having been told by his sister that the deceased had been ill treating her. He repeated the account given in his earlier police interview, to the effect that he had driven to his sister’s home during the blackout that followed the storm, but had left when informed that she was asleep. It was his account that he arrived back at his parent’s home at 10.30pm. 
    56   He said that when he returned to Moree he placed the rifles, that he had kept in his house, in the boot of his car because he did not hold a shooters’ licence, and feared being charged for possession of illegal weapons if he was interviewed by police, or if his home was searched. He agreed in this statement that he had lied to police, when they had asked him whether he had any guns, but then gave the explanation mentioned. 
    57   He also said that some of the relatives of his former wife had brought two pistols and rifles to his house in Moree. The handgun shown to him by police, when they searched his home, he said was similar to one of those pistols. So far as he knew, however, those pistols and rifles had been returned to the relatives. He did not know who owned the Stirling rifle that was found by police underneath Bradley Walsh’s bed. He also said that he knew nothing of the box of bullets found in the freezer. 
    58   He said that he had fallen out with Mr. Doran in late 1986 when he suspected him of having had an affair with his wife. He denied asking him to assist in harming the deceased or discussing any mistreatment of his sister. His relationship with the deceased, he said, was normal for brothers in law and one in which they “got on extremely well”. 
    59   In a separate admission, made on the advice of his counsel, he acknowledged that the .22 Stirling rifle had never been owned by Bradley Walsh. 
    60   There was a good deal of ballistics evidence concerning the array of weapons, cartridge cases and projectiles, that found their way into the case. In summary, the evidence showed that: 
     
      
     (a) the .22 calibre Ruger pistol, found in the clothes basket at lot 2 Villiers Road, was in working order and contained nine .22 calibre Winchester cartridges which were also capable of being used in the .22 calibre Stirling rifle found at the same premises; 
      
      
     (b) the .22 cartridge case found near the aluminium shed could not have been fired by either of those weapons; 
      
      
     (c) the two spent .38 calibre bullets (one found on the grass near the deceased‘s head, and the other recovered from his body) had been discharged from weapons with identical characteristics, most probably a revolver because of the presence of skid marks; it was not possible, however, to determine whether the same weapon had been used; 
      
      
     (d) the Bartram revolver, found in the shirt pocket of the deceased, and the six rifles removed from the Plough & Harrow, were eliminated as having been used to fire the cartridge case found near the shed, and the two .38 calibre spent bullets; 
      
      
     (e) the .357 Magnum shortened carbine found in the lounge chair at Moree was suitable for use with the .357 and .38 ammunition found in the box in the freezer. The two spent .38 calibre bullets located in the grass, and in the deceased’s body, were engraved with similar characteristics as test bullets fired from this weapon, but because they were deformed, it was impossible to reach a positive conclusion whether they had in fact been fired from it; 
      
      
     (f) the fired cartridge case, with the marking “H”, that was found near the shed, had been fired from the .22 calibre Stirling rifle (Ex H) that had been hidden under the bed at the appellant’s home in Moree. 
      
    61   Although, as noted earlier, a good deal of evidence was adduced from Doctors Malouf and Oettle as to the likely sequence of shots, as to whether the shot fired from the .22 was fired from the vicinity of the passenger side of the vehicle of the deceased, as to whether his body had been moved, and as to whether the shot to the back of the head was a post death execution shot. In the end, the various scenarios canvassed involved a degree of speculation and reconstruction of events that could not be determined with any accuracy, and were unlikely to be of much assistance to the Crown or the defence. 
     
      
     THE PROSECUTION AND DEFENCE CASES 
      
    62   It was the Prosecution case that the appellant had murdered the deceased by way of pay back for having mistreated his sister. The Crown recognised that it was unable to say whether he had acted alone, or with the assistance of others - a possibility opened up by the evidence that at least two weapons had been used in the shooting, and by the possibility that the deceased had been disarmed by someone who had placed his .22 calibre pistol in the clothes basket, before he was shot. 
    63   Its case was circumstantial, being based upon: 
     
      
     (a) opportunity, dependent upon the evidence of Debra Dickson, (and the accused’s own admission) to show his presence outside the Cecil Park premises on the evening of the shooting, and upon the evidence of his son as to his absence from the premises where he was staying until after 11pm; 
      
      
     (b) the finding at the appellant’s home in Moree, in September 1990, of the .22 rifle which was positively linked to the fired cartridge case recovered from a position near the shed, and of a .357 Magnum handgun which could have been used to inflict the chest and head wounds; 
      
      
     (c) the fact that each of these weapons was found in a concealed position; 
      
      
     (d) lies told by the appellant about his ownership of weapons; 
      
      
     (e) evidence from some, but not all, witnesses who may have been in a position to know that there was at least an allegation abroad that the deceased had been mistreating the appellant’s sister; 
      
      
     (f) the evidence of Ronald Doran to the effect that the appellant had expressed a desire or intention to do away with the deceased for mistreating his sister; 
      
      
     (g) the evidence of Noella Harb that he had hidden his guns immediately after the killing, and had expressed a concern lest he be interviewed by the police and his home searched; 
      
      
     (h) the evidence of Michael Clarke to the effect that in 1989 the appellant had asked him to look after two .357 Magnum pistols, and had instructed him not to show them to anyone; 
      
      
     (i) the intercepted telephone conversation between the appellant and Noella Harb. 
      
    64   It was accepted that there was no rational possibility of the fatal wounds having been self inflicted. The defence case was one of denial of any responsibility for the shooting.  
    65   The appearance of bullet holes in the deceased’s vehicle, his nocturnal absences, his association with the racing industry, the circumstance that he was accustomed to carrying large sums of money around in his sports bag, the fact that he was always armed, the fears he had expressed and the request he had made to his wife to record the registration numbers of vehicles in the street outside their property, were relied upon to suggest that he had been involved in activities that were not entirely above board, and that one or other of those circumstances, or several in combination, invited the possibility of him having been shot by some person unknown who had a grievance towards him associated with those activities.  
    66   The defence submitted that additional alternative reasonable hypotheses as to persons other than the appellant being the killer had not been, and could not be, excluded. They related inter alia to the circumstances that: 
     
      
     a) Bradley Walsh had been warned off the Cecil Park premises by the deceased following an alleged act of indecency, and had thereafter been causing trouble; 
      
      
     b) moneys had been stolen from the Plough & Harrow business allegedly by the deceased and/or by his mistress; and that 
      
      
     c) the deceased had been engaged in an adulterous relationship at the time of his murder; 
    67   By reason of the manner in which the defence put its case it became necessary for consideration to also be given to the possibility that some of the evidence, which might have seemed to be incriminatory of him, could have been explicable upon the basis that he had been merely helping to get rid of weapons to protect his sister, and hence was guilty of some offence or offences other than that charged. 
    68   His Honour ultimately left the case to the jury upon the basis that the Crown had to prove that the appellant was personally involved in the act that brought about death, or was present as a principal in the second degree, aiding and abetting the shooter. If, however, the facts as found were consistent with him being an accessory after the fact, who had assisted his sister or the shooter in removing the weapons, or was otherwise guilty of an offence of harbouring, then the jury was to acquit him of murder. 
     
      
      
     GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
      
      
      REJECTION OF DEFENCE EVIDENCE 
      
      
     Two matters were relied upon. 
      
    69   First, it was submitted that his Honour erred in rejecting the tender by the defence of a photograph of a .22 right hand bolt Lithgow rifle in the hands of the son of the appellant. The purpose of the tender apparently was to show that the appellant from time to time used weapons in a benign and family context (ie without any malignant predisposition), and to eliminate that weapon as having been used in the killing.  
    70   There was no evidence or suggestion by the Crown that the weapon in this photograph had been the murder weapon, or that it was the semi automatic .22 rifle (Ex H) found at Moree. Nor was there any issue that the appellant and his friends used rifles, and other weapons, for shooting rabbits and targets in a non criminal way (ie subject to the holding of any relevant licence) both at Cecil Park and on various country properties.  
    71   The photograph had in my view no probative value. Its tender was only likely to lead to a false issue, and was rightly rejected. 
    72   Secondly, it was submitted that his Honour erred in not allowing Gregory Fowler to give evidence of the deceased having been in a distressed state when he saw him on several occasions over the period of 6 to 12 months before his death, and of rejecting inquiries directed towards him, as to the reasons for his distress. It was put that linked with the evidence of bullet holes in his car, this evidence would support the defence contention that the deceased had been involved in activities consistent with him being placed in danger by some person or persons unknown. 
    73   The evidence of the sighting of the bullet holes was allowed. His Honour, however, rejected the evidence of distress upon the basis that there was no evidence to suggest that the appellant’s distressed state had anything to do with the bullet holes.  
    74   In the absence of the deceased having offered some explanation for the bullet holes, and of his distress being related to that occurrence or to fear at the hands of others, the evidence had, in my view, no probative value. It would be entirely equivocal and not add to the alternative hypothesis, which the appellant wished to pursue. No error has been shown in this respect. 
     
      
     DIRECTIONS CONCERNING BRADLEY WALSH  
      
    75   It was submitted that in circumstances where this witness purported to have no recollection of any relevant events, but was given a certificate under S128 of the Evidence Act, and cross examined by the Crown pursuant to leave under S38 of that Act to establish, following concession, what it was that he had said at the previous trial, there was a need for a special caution. 
    76   Like Vikki Climpson, he was in a peculiar position in so far as there had been a falling out between him and the deceased, and insofar as he had accepted, in his evidence at the first trial, that he was not the owner of the .22 Stirling rifle, and had lied to police in that regard when it was found at the home of the appellant in Moree. On one possible view, he was an accomplice or person with a possible motive to kill the deceased. On another view he was an accessory after the fact, or a person attempting to pervert the course of justice to assist the appellant. 
    77   A direction was given in relation to this witness in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “My direction is that the evidence of Bradley Walsh may be unreliable because of the criminal matter I have told you, of which he has been convicted and because of his statement that I have just reminded you of, at page 685, that he had said that what he told Det Prentice was false. 
       
      
      
       
       He denied his evidence during the course of his statements and you must take into account the way he gave evidence in proceedings before you, and in addition to the interfering with a witness conviction, all of those matters should be taken into account in assessing his reliability; that is, in relation to the evidence in these proceedings and in the previous proceedings.” 
       
      
      
     His Honour later added:… 
      
       
        
       “I want to remind you concerning the evidence of Bradley Walsh, that is, in relation to a direction I gave as to his unreliability. That in fact I did not give you specifically. I now specifically remind you he was convicted of the offence of interfering in other proceedings. That is a matter you should take into account in assessing the reliability of his evidence, as it goes to improper conduct in relation to court proceedings. I want to also remind you that Bradley Walsh told the court that he told lies on 25 January 1988 and 29 January 1988. 
        
       
      
    78   No additional direction was sought at the trial. Although the direction was very much a shorthand caution, it sufficed in my view, to bring to the attention of the jury the need to treat this witness’s evidence with care because of his conviction for an offence of interfering in another matter, because of his concession that he had told a lie to Detective Prentice, and because of the manner in which he gave evidence. Rule 4 applies, and the ground is not made out. 
     
      
     SUGGESTED OMISSIONS IN THE SUMMING UP 
      
    79   It was submitted that, in several respects, his Honour failed to give relevant or sufficient directions, concerning: 
     
      
     (a) the identification of the various firearms  
      
    80   This related to the firearms mentioned by the witnesses Clarke, Doran and Harb on the various occasions when they were alleged to have been seen by them. No such directions were sought, and in any event their identification was of peripheral relevance. 
     
      
     (b) Motive 
      
    81   This related to the suggested need for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had a motive to kill the deceased because of his belief that the latter was mistreating his sister. 
    82   In response to a question from the jury: “How important is the question of motive and proving motive in this case?” his Honour gave the following direction: 
     
      
       
       “My direction of law is this: as a matter of law it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove motive as part of its case. However, in this case the Crown alleges a motive, that motive being a belief by the accused that Trevor Climpson had been mistreating Vikki. 
       
      
      
       
       The duty of the Crown is to prove the elements of the offence. The evaluation of the matter of motive is a matter for you as judges of the facts, so that it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove motive as part of its case. That is a matter of evaluation for you. The duty on the Crown is to prove the elements of the offence which I gave you on the last occasion. 
       
      
    83   This was not a particularly helpful direction, although so far as it went it was correct in law. Preferably, his Honour should have explained that motive was a matter relied upon by the Crown as a strand in a circumstantial case, which if made out would support that case, but if not made out would be neutral. It was not an intermediate fact and the reasoning in Shepherd (1990) 97 ALR 161 applied. It was accordingly not necessary that motive be established in this case beyond reasonable doubt: Penney (1998) 155 ALR 605; Plevac (1999) NSW CCA 351. This ground is not made good. 
    84   It does, however, need to be considered in relation to an allied complaint concerning the following direction: 
     
      
       
       “Some of the circumstances relied upon by the Crown are essential to prove the Crown case. Some are non-essential matters that merely support and add strength to the Crown case. In fact, although it is not essential you find those circumstances proved beyond reasonable doubt , however, if you find circumstances, that is not essential circumstances, or any of them, probably existed, that finding may assist you in your main task; that is, to decide on the whole of the evidence whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.” 
       
      
      
     This was not followed by any attempt to identify into which category the various matters relied upon as constituting circumstantial proof, fell. Having introduced the distinction it was incumbent upon his Honour to complete the direction, or to have withdrawn it and explained what is required by way of proof in a strands circumstantial case. 
      
      
     (c) The need for a  
     McKinney 
      direction or warning under S165 Evidence Act.  
      
    85   It was submitted that an issue arose in the light of the cross examination of various police witnesses, and of the unsworn statement of the appellant, as to whether the record of interview was, in those respects that dealt with firearms, fabricated, and was signed only after threats had been made to rip up the carpet in his house, to knock holes in the walls, and to dig up the yard. In those circumstances, there was, so it was submitted, a need for a special warning.  
    86   No such direction was sought at the trial, nor was the admissibility of the record canvassed under SS 90 or 138 of the Evidence Act. The record of interview was signed, and S 165(1)(f) did not apply. In the absence of any request, and having regard to the circumstance that the Crown case did not depend upon the record of interview as providing a confession of guilt or otherwise than peripherally, the case was not one, in my view, which called for the warnings suggested. 
     
      
     (d) Accessory after the Fact 
      
    87   This related to the suggested need to inform the jury that there was no evidence that the appellant had given the rifle, or handgun, found by police at Moree to some person prior to the killing, in the light of a possible scenario that he had done this and had then left the scene before someone else had shot the deceased; and that they were not free to speculate (presumably about this).  
    88   The Crown case was not conducted upon the basis of the possible scenario suggested, it having been its case that the appellant had been present either as a principal in the first or in the second degree when the deceased was shot, and had then removed the weapons used in the shooting.  
    89   Earlier, directions had been given in response to a jury question “does supplying the murder weapons constitute aiding and abetting?”. The direction then given was appropriate and approved by Counsel. To have given the further direction requested was only likely to cause confusion. The ground is not made good. 
     
      
     REFUSAL TO PROVIDE THE JURY WITH A TRANSCRIPT OF THE TRIAL 
      
    90   It was submitted that, since the first time that the jury learned they would not have a transcript of the trial, was at the end of summing up, and that almost immediately afterwards they made to a request to have it, there was a possibility that they had refrained from taking notes during the trial. Further, it was submitted that the complexity of the trial was such that, notwithstanding the usual practice, the request was reasonable. 
    91   This submission is not made good. Although it is now possible for the jury to be allowed to have the transcript, or selected portions of it,(S 55C Jury Act 1977) that is a discretionary decision. There are dangers in following this course, without good reason, particularly in a lengthy trial. Most obviously there is a risk of the jury reading only part of the evidence and not having the benefit of reading the balance of the evidence, in the course of which a witness may well contradict, qualify or correct something said earlier, or of reading the evidence of some other witness who may have given a contrary version. 
    92   It is preferable in most cases, and this was certainly one of them, for the relevant evidence to be sufficiently identified in the summing up, and for the jury to be reminded that, if they wish to have assistance in specific respects, for the evidence touching upon those matters to be read, or if it can be conveniently done and contained within reasonable limits, for the relevant pages of transcript to be provided, with editing of any matter not received in the presence of the jury. 
    93   His Honour comprehensively summarised the evidence during the summing up, and appropriately reminded the jury that any further assistance needed concerning the evidence would be accommodated. The ground is not made good. 
     
      
     DIRECTIONS CONCERNING LIES 
      
    94   The learned trial Judge gave a number of directions concerning lies said to have been told by the appellant in relation to his ownership of firearms arising out of his record of interview of 21 January 1988 as follows: 
     
      
       
       “Q.66 Do you own any firearms? A. I used to. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. 67 What type of firearms are they? A. A .22 calibre Lithgow and a .22 what my wife bought me but I sold it at the beginning of this year. 
       
      
      
       
       Q.68 Have you ever owned any pistols. A. No.” 
       
      
    95   The initial directions given included an observation by his Honour to the effect that the appellant has admitted telling lies in relations to questions 66 and 67. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
       “I want to direct you that, unless you are satisfied in relation to that third question, question 68, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused did what is alleged, that is that he lied, that you cannot use the allegation against him. 
       
      
      
       
       If you are satisfied, you may draw an inference against him that he acted in this way because he was guilty of the crime. Before you draw an inference in relation to question 68, that he lied, you must be satisfied not only that the conduct has been proved beyond reasonable doubt, you must also be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt there is no other reasonable explanation for it in the circumstances. You must remember that people do not always act rationally and that conduct of this sort may sometimes be caused in other ways, for example panic, fear, a desire to protect others, weakness of mind and other reasons that will no doubt occur to you. 
       
      
      
       
       Further, even if you are satisfied that he was motivated by consciousness of guilt, before this can support the Crown case you must further be satisfied that what was in his mind was guilt of the offence charged, not some other offence. 
       
      
      
       
       If you are so satisfied then you are entitled to use the finding  
       in aid of 
        the other evidence in the Crown case, as pointing to the guilt of the accused. Standing by itself, it is not proof of guilt. The other two questions of course are relied on by the Crown in support of the crown case: they are admitted by the accused in this case.” 
       
      
    96   This direction was clearly inadequate, and erroneous in law so far as it omitted any reference to the need for the lie to relate to a material circumstance, and so far as it dealt insufficiently, with the answers to questions 66 and 67. It was later withdrawn. His Honour at that point instructed the jury in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “I wish to withdraw the specific wording I used in relation to the direction on lies and I now give you a new direction in relation to that. A lie can constitute an  
       admission against interest 
        only if it is concerned with some circumstances or an event connected with the offence, that is, it relates to a material issue. If it was told by an accused in circumstances in which the explanation for the lie is that he knew the truth would implicate him in an offence, that is, in any case where a lie is relied upon to prove the lie should be identified. I have given you question 68. I instruct you that you may take the lie into account only if you are satisfied, having regard to the circumstances of the events, in relation to question 68 that reveals knowledge of the offence or some aspect of it and that it was told because the accused knew the truth of the matter about which he lied would implicate him in the offence, and because of a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. 
       
      
      
       
       You should understand there may be reasons for the telling of the lie apart from the realisation of guilt. A lie can be told out of panic, to escape an unjust accusation, to protect some other person, or often a conclusion extraneous to the offence. I wish to tell you that  
       if you accept there is 
         
       another explanation 
        for the lie, it cannot be regarded as an admission. In this particular case you remember the accused gave, as a reason for not making admissions in relation to the guns, that he was concerned about the loss of the guns and was concerned about not having a shooter’s licence. You will remember that evidence. That is a possible reason you should take into account before finding that the lies may be taken into account. Any  
       lies told by the accused may be taken into account as consciousness of guilt.” 
       
      
      
     This direction did not, to my mind, overcome the problem. It was deficient or erroneous in several respects: 
      
      
     a) so far as it purported to reproduce what was said by Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, in  
     Edwards v The Queen 
      (1993) 178 CLR 193, it did not on its face do so, particularly in relation to the first two sentences, although that possibly may be the result of an error in transcription or punctuation, which was overlooked when the summing up was revised. 
      
      
     b) it did not sufficiently explain the need for the Crown to show that the lie was a deliberate falsehood. 
      
      
     c) it did not sufficiently identify what was the material issue to which the lies were said to relate, an important aspect of the direction since it is very easy for a jury to place unwarranted significance upon a peripheral lie told by the accused. 
      
      
     d) so far as the direction instructed the jury “…  
     if you accept 
      there is another explanation for the lie, it cannot be regarded as an admission” that risked reversing the onus of proof - it being for the Crown to satisfy the jury that there was no other reasonable possibility open in that regard; it does not fall upon the appellant to establish an alternative explanation; 
      
      
     e) the directions again not deal with the answers to questions 66 and 67, the materiality of which is not readily apparent having regard to the present tense in which those questions were put. 
      
      
     f) the direction concluded with the wholly misleading and erroneous instruction that “ 
     any 
      lie told by the accused may be taken as a consciousness of guilt”; and 
      
      
     g) on this occasion the direction seemingly moved from a matter relied upon as a fact in a circumstantial case to an admission of guilt. 
      
    97   Very great care is required in relation to lies (Heyde (1990) 20 NSWLR 234 and Qian Li Zhen (1995) 83 A Crim R 575), and in particular, in identifying whether they are relied upon as an admission of guilt, or as one of a number of circumstances from which an inference of guilt is to be drawn, or as support for the evidence of another witness, or simply as a matter going to credibility of the accused. 
    98   In my view this ground has been made good, and having regard to the problems associated with the Weissensteiner direction to which I will come, provide further reason for ordering a new trial. 
     
      
     LEAVE TO CROSS EXAMINE VIKKI CLIMPSON AND BRADLEY WALSH UNDER S 38 EVIDENCE ACT  
      
    99   At the outset of the trial, the Crown Prosecutor foreshadowed an intention to seek leave to cross examine Vikki Climpson under S 38(1)(c) of the Evidence Act, because it was inevitable, in view of the various statements that she had made, that there would be a prior statement inconsistent with her evidence, whichever way it came out. This application was allowed, as was the enlarged application brought under S 38(1)(a) of the Act, upon the basis that she had given evidence unfavourable to the Prosecution. 
    100   The grant of leave was accompanied by the issue of a certificate under S 128 of the Evidence Act, so as to protect the witness from the consequences of self incrimination, in the event that she found it necessary to admit that information provided, or evidence led from her on a prior occasion had been knowingly untrue. 
    101   A similar situation arose in relation to Bradley Walsh when it became apparent that he claimed to have lost all memory in relation to any matters relevant to the murder. 
    102   The broad submission addressed was that his Honour fell into error in granting leave, and in allowing the Prosecution, in each instance, to call a witness who was known to be hostile or unfavourable, in the expectation of using S 38, so as to place before the jury otherwise impermissible, i.e. inadmissible statements, contrary to the principles established in Blewitt (1988) 62 ALJR 503. 
    103   The position in relation to Vikki Climpson was somewhat complicated by the circumstance that she had provided a number of statements to the police that were contradictory, in relevant respects - for example, as to the precise nature of her relationship with the deceased at the time of his death, how it was that his .22 pistol had found its way into the washing basket, and as to the movements of the deceased on the day of his death; by the circumstance that at the time she had initially spoken to police she was in a state of depression, was possibly suicidal, and had overdosed on drugs; and also by the fact that, although she had been initially charged with the murder, and had stood trial with the appellant, those proceedings had been no billed, so far as she was concerned. 
    104   In the course of foreshadowing the application, at which the witness was represented by Counsel, the Crown Prosecutor made it clear that she wished to cross examine this witness generally as to her credit; and to explore circumstances which could have been capable of linking her to a scenario in which she had either directly, or indirectly (through her complaints of mistreatment), encouraged the appellant to kill the deceased, or had assisted him subsequently in deflecting police investigations - inter alia by inciting Kevin Bell to tell lies to the police, and by suggesting the deceased’s involvement in criminal activities. 
    105   Although the Crown Prosecutor, at one point, disavowed any intention of asserting that she was an accomplice on the night of the shooting, the tenor of the cross examination was clearly such as to invite her participation in it, although not in any particularly well defined way. 
    106   The debate in this respect arose first in the context of S 128 of the Evidence Act, the Crown Prosecutor, defence counsel and her own counsel being appreciative of the circumstance that she may well object to giving any evidence that may incriminate her; and the Crown Prosecutor, in any event, being uncertain as to what she would say if called as a witness. Dr. Woods QC (as he then was), did not concede the Crown’s entitlement to cross examine her in the ways foreshadowed, but placed on the record that he would not be inviting any Jones v Dunkel inference, if she was not called as a witness. In that regard, it was submitted that cross examination, on her prior inconsistent statements, would have the effect of weakening her credibility to the point where her evidence had little, if any, probative value. 
    107   In all those circumstances it was submitted, both by Dr. Woods QC and by her own counsel, that she should not be required under S 128(5) to give evidence, a submission which if accepted would have made the need for leave, under S 38, to cross examine her, academic. 
    108   The approach which the Crown Prosecutor took was that she was the person best placed to inform the jury of the true nature of the relationship between the appellant and the deceased and between herself and the deceased; of anything that she had conveyed to the appellant or some third party concerning any mistreatment of her by the deceased; of the circumstances in which the killing occurred (as she was present at the house when the deceased was shot); of anything that had been done that night in relation to any weapon owned or customarily carried by the deceased, in particular the .22 Ruger that was found in the clothes basket; and whether prior to his shooting the deceased had been disarmed. 
    109   As such it was put that she was a witness who had information potentially going to the heart of the case, particularly motive, and that it was incumbent upon the prosecution to offer her to the jury, and then to test the evidence she could give, leaving it to the jury to assess her credibility. Accordingly, it was submitted that a certificate should be given under S 128 of the Act, and leave granted under S 38, so as to allow this to occur. 
    110   This proposition found favour with the learned trial Judge, who observed: 
     
      
       
       “… it seems to me the Crown is obliged to call the witness, Vikki Climpson, and having called that witness, is obliged in terms of S 38 of the Act, to endeavour to cross examine the witness, at least because of the conflicts which have been made in her statements”. 
       
      
    111   The problem now addressed on appeal was, however, foreshadowed by his Honour in his judgment of 5 May 1997, so far as he observed: 
     
      
       
       “…..the evidence of the witness may, in part, be of assistance to the accused, so far as she may present as a Crown witness of lowered credibility. It may be, on the other hand, that her association with the accused would make any attempts by her to prevaricate or to give evidence favourable to the accused in the end against his interests”. 
       
      
    112   Having given a certificate under S 128 of the Act, the debate turned to S 38(1) (c) of the Act, in the course of which it was made clear that the Crown sought also to rely on S 38 (1)(a), so as to cross examine the witness inter alia, in relation to whether she had ever complained to anyone else about the deceased mistreating her; in relation to the presence of the appellant at her home during the night of 7 January and for part of 8 January, including the time of the shooting, and in relation to her account to the effect that the deceased had placed the .22 Ruger pistol in its pouch, in the washing basket, on the night of 7th January for her protection (in contrast with the evidence of Robert Climpson that the appellant had kept it in a safe that night and had only taken it with him the next day).  
    113   A number of other areas for possible cross examination were canvassed, to not all of which the defence objected. The argument was principally directed to cross examination concerning the Ruger; the events on the night of 7 January; the use by the deceased of the large number of guns with which he appeared to have some connection - and their location at the relevant times; the telephone conversation in 1999 between her and Kevin Bell, in which, so it was suggested, she had encouraged him to supply untrue evidence to the police that would corroborate her evidence; and whether or not she had made allegations to Anita Usope of mistreatment at the hands of the deceased. 
    114   Although his Honour recognised that all this evidence was potentially detrimental to the interests of the accused, it was his conclusion that it was “nonetheless not unfair” that it be called, it being “clearly a matter of importance, in terms of the prosecution case, being relevant evidence that ought to be placed before the jury for their consideration and evaluation.” 
    115   Upon that basis, and for the reasons outlined in two separate judgments delivered on 6 May 1997, leave was granted under S 38. 
    116   Although the reasons given for allowing cross examination in relation to specific matters did to a degree overlap, and were in some respects, but not all, confined to issues of credit, it does appear that leave was eventually given under S 38(1)(a) so far as the witness’ evidence in chief was in conflict with that expected to be called from other witnesses; under S 38(1)(b) so far as his Honour assessed the witness as not making a genuine attempt to give evidence; and also under S 38(1) (c) so far as her evidence in chief was in conflict with prior statements that she had made to police. 
    117   The cross examination by the Crown Prosecutor that occurred once leave was given, was extensive and critical of the witness’s veracity - it being made abundantly clear that the Crown challenged many of her answers and suggested, by implication if not expressly, that she had some involvement in the killing, or was, at least, endeavouring to assist the appellant in relation to any prosecution brought against him. 
    118   The Crown Prosecutor was similarly permitted to cross examine Bradley Walsh when he claimed to have lack of memory of the relevant events, to show, in particular, what it was that he had said, at the first trial, concerning the events at Moree, when the police found the .22 Stirling rifle and the .357 Magnum shortened weapon. 
    119   Arising out of this evidence the Crown was able to float the possibility that this witness had tried to protect the appellant in relation to the matters under investigation, and to garner support for the proposition that the weapons found belonged to the appellant. So far as he might have appeared to prevaricate, or to have told lies in the past, there was a similar risk of his evidence rebounding to the discredit of the accused. Conversely there was the same possibility, as that identified by his Honour in relation to Vikki Climpson, that the jury would have regarded his evidence as unreliable. 
    120   Blewitt, upon which the appellant relied, was decided prior to the Evidence Act, being a decision concerned with the position at common law so far as witnesses reasonably anticipated as being hostile were concerned, and with the common law principle that cross examination on a prior inconsistent statement was relevant only to the issue of credibility. Section 38 of the Evidence Act now permits a party, by leave, to cross examine a witness who meets any of the criteria identified in sub section (1). Its exercise is, however, subject to a number of discretionary considerations, so as to prevent its abuse, and is a section that needs to be applied with some care in criminal trials. So it is that before leave is granted, the trial Judge must give consideration to the matters specified in SS 38(6), 135 to 137, and 192 of the Act. 
    121   What is now clear is that it is to be given its full effect, and that it is not to be confined to the situation where a party calling a witness is confronted unexpectedly by evidence that is “unfavourable” as that expression has been explained in Souleyman (1996) 40 NSWLR 712 (Gilbert Adam 47 NSWLR 267); or, I would add, where such a party is confronted with the situation where the witness unexpectedly gives evidence that is inconsistent with prior statements or unexpectedly appears not to be making a genuine attempt to give evidence. 
    122   Gilbert Adam was a case where the terms of previous inconsistent representations were adduced in the course of cross examination, after the Crown was able to show that the relevant witnesses, although present at the scene of the killing, claimed to have no knowledge of what had occurred, or gave accounts that were wholly inconsistent with their earlier statements. 
    123   Once received the evidence of the prior representations was allowed to go to the jury as proof of the truth of the facts asserted by them (under S 60 of the Evidence Act), being matters of which the witnesses had direct knowledge - ie once admitted their use was not confined to the question of credibility. (Gilbert Adam at paras 102 to 107) 
    124   The appellant’s submission so far as it was based upon Blewitt is not made good, since the Evidence Act has led to a marked change in the law. That does not exhaust the argument, however, since further questions arise as to whether leave should have been given, consistently with the matters that needed to be taken into account under S 38(6) and S 192(2) of the Act, as well as those affecting the possible exclusion of the evidence under SS 135 and 137. 
    125   It is almost certainly the case that, absent an entitlement to cross examine them, the Crown Prosecutor would not have called either Vikki Climpson or Bradley Walsh as a witness. It is equally certain that the appellant would not have required either to be called by the Crown, nor offered them in its case. Indeed, in the case of Vikki Climpson, Dr Woods QC expressly offered to refrain from inviting a Jones v Dunkel inference, or seeking any such direction. Presumably the same would have been the case with Bradley Walsh had that been canvassed.  
    126   The question that now arises needs to be considered in the light of the concession, made in the Crown submissions on appeal, that the “overall impact of both witnesses … would have been slight”, and that their evidence in the end would have been “fairly neutral”. If that is a correct analysis of the position, then it would follow that the probative value of the evidence each had to offer was slight, and that all the learned Crown Prosecutor had achieved, in substance, was to put them up and knock them down. 
    127   The point is not, in my view, to be dismissed quite so easily, having regard to the considerations which the learned trial judge identified. Each was a witness who, either on the Crown case (in relation to Vikki Climpson) or the defence case (in relation to Bradley Walsh) was a person who was possibly implicated in the killing or who was the occasion of a motive for it. Each was a person who, on the Crown case, had attempted to protect the appellant. Each was a witness who, by reason of the cross examination, was shown to be unreliable and to have told lies. Inevitably there was a risk of some of this rubbing off on the appellant, since their separate interests almost inevitably would have been seen by the jury to have coincided with his own interests.  
    128   Moreover, so far as evidence was led from police concerning the answers given to them by Bradley Walsh when he was interviewed, and upon the basis of which his cross examination was pursued to show that he had lied, attention seems not to have been given to the inadmissibility, in a case brought against the appellant, of any conversation that he had with police, that was not adopted by the appellant, or of the circumstance that, if he was shown to have lied, that was not a matter that could be used against the appellant. 
    129   Having regard to these considerations, and in the light of the circumstances that the Crown did not risk a Jones v Dunkel inference, that the appellant made no request for either witness to be called in accordance with the principles in Apostilides (1984) 154 CLR 563, Whitehorn (1983) 152 CLR 657, and Kneebone (1999) NSWCCA 279 AND that the appellant was prepared to acknowledge that Bradley Walsh was not the owner of the .22 Stirling rifle found at Moree, it seems to me that the preferable course would have been for the Crown to have avoided calling either as a witness.  
    130   I am not persuaded that there was an appellable error in the grant of leave under S 38 of the Act, once a decision was made to call these witnesses. Rather, it appears to me that, in all the circumstances, once objection was taken, and once an assessment was made that their evidence, after cross examination, would be most likely to be neutral, then consideration should have been given to SS 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act, provisions to which no one at the trial appears to have directed their attention, at least in this context. 
    131   Whether the same result should occur at a retrial will depend upon an assessment of the position that each witness is likely to take at the time and of their reliability (a matter possibly capable of being tested on the voir dire), upon whether the defence requires either to be called, and upon its willingness to forego seeking against the Crown any Jones v Dunkel inference in the event that they are not called. 
    132   If in fact they are called at any further trial, then consideration will need to be given to the time at which the Crown seeks, and is given, leave to cross examine them; and if it is permitted to do so after they have first been cross examined by the defence, whether the defence should have further leave to cross examine them - the course approved in Milat, Hunt CJ at CL 23 April 1996 unreported. It will also be incumbent upon the trial judge to direct the jury that any lies told by them, or any attempt by Vikki Climpson to persuade Kevin Bell to tell lies, go only to the issue of their credibility as witnesses and cannot be used as a circumstance in support of the Crown case against the appellant, unless it is shown that he adopted what they did or encouraged them to that end. 
    133   This appears to have been entirely overlooked, and it reinforces the risk that their potentially unreliable and conflicting evidence was used to the disadvantage of the appellant. The absence of such a direction, in the context of the matters identified, in relation to this ground, risked a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
     The Weissensteiner direction 
      
    134   Over the objection of the appellant, his Honour gave the jury a direction in accordance with the decision of the High Court in Weissensteiner (1993) 178 CLR 217. 
    135   The case was one in which the appellant (having been charged with the offence prior to 10 June 1994) had the choice of remaining silent, or giving evidence on oath, or giving an unworn statement. He chose the latter, but in his unsworn statement he did not canvass all of the matters that had been ventilated by witnesses in the Crown case.  
    136   In deciding to give a Weissensteiner direction, his Honour took as the ratio for that decision the proposition that, where facts are peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused, and he or she does not give evidence as to those facts, then the jury may be instructed that they might more comfortably accept the specific evidence tendered by the Crown in relation to those facts.  
    137   His Honour also had regard to the decision of Hunt CJ at CL In Milat 9 April 1996 unreported, to the effect that S 20(2) of the Evidence Act did not apply to a case where the accused had the right to make an unsworn statement, and that in such a case the nature of the comment that might be made was determined by the common law, unaffected by the section. 
    138   After a review of the authorities, and the particular circumstances of the present case, his Honour decided to give a Weissensteiner direction which he indicated would relate to those areas where, on his assessment, the appellant had not, in his unsworn statement, given a denial or explanation. They related to the following matters: 
     
      
     i) the time of his return home on the night of the shooting, a matter in respect of which his son had given evidence to the effect that he had not returned before the movie finished (at 11.08pm) - this was the subject of a contrary version by the appellant in his unsworn statement, it being his suggestion there that he had returned at 10.30pm, and had chatted to his mother for a while, although he made no mention of seeing the film or his son. 
      
      
     ii) the evidence Bradley Walsh had given in the first trial, concerning the presence of a .22 rifle which he had seen hidden under the pallet in the yard of the Moree premises about a week before the search on 19 September 1990, which was then moved into the house, and discovered by police under his bed - a matter which his Honour concluded had not been dealt with in the statement of the appellant (although its discovery by police was expressly acknowledged, being the subject of a specific comment by the appellant “I’ve never owned it, I’ve never fired it and I don’t know who owns it”), and which had been the subject of an assertion to police in the record of interview that it was owned by Bradley Walsh - a matter that was qualified by the admission during the trial that the appellant now knew that it was not owned by and never had been owned by that witness; 
      
      
     (iii) the evidence of Bradley Walsh, similarly led at the first trial, concerning the .357 Magnum that he had also seen at the house prior to the search, and which on his account had been brought there a few days before by “some bloke from the pub” - a weapon which was also the subject of evidence from Michael Clarke, Noella Harb and Detective Keen (the latter in relation to its discovery during the 19th September search). In this regard the appellant made some reference to this weapon in his statement (including an acknowledgment that it was found by police and a suggestion that one similar to it had been initially brought there by Lebanese relatives of his wife and later returned to them). On his Honour’s assessment, the appellant had not traversed or explained the specific evidence of those witnesses (the only explanation offered in the statement, concerning the two weapons, being that the appellant was “pretty dumb-founded by their discovery”). 
      
      
     (iv) the evidence of Mr. Clarke and of Inspector Parsons concerning the yellow cartridge box found in the freezer - a matter which was in fact the subject of an observation by the appellant in his statement to the effect that he did not recall having seen the box before, and that between the committal and trial there seemed to have been some change in its contents.  
      
      
     (v) the taped telephone conversation between the appellant and Noella Harb - as to which it is the fact that there was no mention in the statement of the appellant, or explanation, as to “what he meant” (ie why) he had endeavoured to stop any discussion about weapons and had suggested that the weapons had been “planted” by police when, in his interview, he had suggested that the .357 Magnum had been given to him by a truck driver. 
      
    139   In respect of each of these matters, his Honour concluded that a Weissensteiner direction should be given, despite having earlier acknowledged that there may well be circumstances where it would not be reasonable to expect an accused to offer an answer or explanation. Those he identified included situations where the defence was one of absolute denial; or where the Crown case was very weak and evidence led by it was lacking in cogency, or where an answer had been provided in an ERISP or statement made out of court. His Honour also acknowledged that the present may be a case where the appellant would have a legitimate reason to avoid giving evidence, and facing cross examination, because of the possibility that he was protecting his sister, or because of the possibility that he personally had been guilty of some other offence including hindering police or accessory after the fact. 
    140   The directions which were given in relation to these items immediately followed upon a direction as to the way the jury might approach the unsworn statement: 
     
      
       
       “There are a number of particular circumstances flowing from the election by the accused to make an unsworn statement in this case, to which I should draw your attention.” 
       
      
      
     The five items mentioned above were identified, and the relevant evidence of the witnesses in the Crown case concerning each was noted or read. 
      
    141   In relation to the first of those, ie the time of the appellant’s return home on the night of the shooting, his Honour observed: 
     
      
       
       “In determining 
         
       whether the evidence of Adam Fowler should be accepted you may do so more readily, if you think it is appropriate, because the denial of that evidence by the accused has  
       not been given on oath 
        and has not been tested by cross-examination”. 
       
      
    142   As to the second, ie the evidence of Bradley Walsh concerning the .22 Stirling rifle, the direction given was somewhat different, namely: 
     
      
       
       “Now in relation to that evidence of Bradley Walsh, in determining whether the evidence of Bradley Walsh on that aspect should be accepted, you may do so more readily, if you think it is appropriate, because the denial of that evidence by the accused has not been  
       made in his statement or in the case 
       .” 
       
      
    143   As to the third, ie the evidence of Bradley Walsh, Michael Clarke and Noella Harb, the direction given differed yet again, namely: 
     
      
       
       “That evidence was attacked on behalf of the accused, when the witnesses who gave it were cross examined. In determining whether the evidence of those witnesses should be accepted, you may do so more readily if you think it is appropriate, because there has been no denial  
       in the 
         
       unsworn statement 
        of the accused in relation to that matter. There is a denial of some of that evidence, but not all of that evidence.” 
       
      
    144   At this point, objection was taken to the directions, following which his Honour said to the jury: 
     
      
       
       “Members of the jury, after I told you about making an unsworn statement I reminded you of the specific evidence that you may take into account that has not been answered in the  
       dock statement 
       . I did not intend by that to emphasise or give specific importance to that evidence and I therefore propose to withdraw the direction that I was giving to you about that evidence in specific terms and specifically withdraw the direction I gave you after referring to the last three areas of evidence, Adam, Clarke, Harb and Keen, because the direction I gave did not correctly put to you the answer the accused gave to you in his  
       unsworn statement 
       .  
       
      
      
       
       I want you to look at the areas of evidence that I am now referring you to and I want you to look at it, however, in the light of the whole of the context of that witness’s evidence. I also want you to look at it in the light of the other evidence of that witness and in the light of the whole of the evidence, because it is on the whole of the evidence that you should rely. 
       
      
      
       
       Therefore, I have withdrawn the specific evidence I have read out and I want to now direct you that evidence by Adam Fowler of what happened on the night and the accused’s reply and the agreed facts. That evidence was attacked by the accused and, determining whether that evidence may be accepted, you may do so, if you think it is appropriate, because the denial of the accused  
       has not been given on oath 
        and not tested under cross-examination. 
       
      
      
       
       The evidence of the finding of the Stirling .22 calibre rifle, the evidence of Bradley Walsh should be accepted, you may do so if you think it is appropriate, because the denial of the evidence by the accused  
       has not been given on 
         
       oath 
        and has not been tested in cross-examination, and in that respect I remind you of Bradley Walsh’s evidence.” 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       “I remind you then of the evidence given by Mr. Clarke, Noella Harb and Detective Keen concerning the Armi Jager, Ex Z and I want to say to you in respect of that evidence, there was no evidence given by the accused in his unsworn statement about the evidence of Walsh, but that he did agree, in part of his statement, about the weapons going out onto his property ... So he answered that in part in his  
       statement 
       . 
       
      
      
       
       … But I want to say in respect of three areas: that is Clarke, Harb and Keen, as I have qualified it, you may take into account the way in which the accused answered that in his  
       unsworn statement 
        in evaluating that evidence.” 
       
      
    145   His Honour then turned to the fourth item, the finding of the box of cartridges, and gave a direction as follows: 
     
      
       
       “….when determining whether the evidence of those witnesses should be accepted you may do so more readily, if you think it is appropriate, because the denial of that evidence by the accused have  
       not been given on oath 
        and has not been tested by cross-examination” 
       
      
    146   As to the fifth and final matter, the interrupted telephone conversation, his Honour directed the jury: 
     
      
       
       “In determining whether the evidence of the witness in relation to that evidence should be accepted, you may do so more readily, if you think it appropriate, because the denial of that evidence by the accused has  
       not been given on oath 
        and has not been tested in cross-examination”. 
       
      
    147   The directions given in relation to those matters were inconsistent; they were in my view confusing, as a result of the withdrawal and redirection that occurred after the first three items; and additionally they seemed to go beyond the objective sought to be achieved by his Honour, which was to invite the equivalent of a Weissensteiner direction in relation to those matters that had not been addressed in the unsworn statement, since in some instances (ie items (i) (iv) and (v) the direction was based upon the circumstance that the appellant had not given evidence on oath, whereas in other instances (ie items (ii) and (iii)), it was based upon the circumstance that the relevant matter had not been dealt with in the statement. 
    148   A further difficulty arose in that his Honour did not sufficiently identify what it was that the appellant had, in fact, said in relation to each item, it not having been the case (contrary to the underlying assumption), that the appellant had remained silent in his unsworn statement as to each matter. 
    149   The difficulty thus arising was compounded by the circumstance that when his Honour returned to the matter, he observed: 
     
      
       
       I … want to put to you, in relation to the direction I gave you about the areas that were not answered, or were only partly answered in his  
       statement from the dock 
        - and this was put to you by Dr Woods. I put it to you quite independently of that, that you should take into account the possible reason, the stress and the pressure that he has been under in the intervening nine years and four months, or seven months since the charge, and the fact of the length of time since the commencement of the proceedings and the number of proceedings involved as a possible reason. Those are matters you should take into account, in relation to the directions I gave you about those areas of the main case which, as I have said, you may more readily accept if you think appropriate, because the denial of the evidence by the accused has  
       not been given on oath 
        and has not been tested by cross-examination and  
       has not been answered in any dock statement.” 
       
      
    150   This in my view risked adding even more confusion in view of the contrast between the opening and closing words of the direction, and by the combined reference in the closing words to the absence of a denial on oath or in the “dock statement” - the latter being itself an expression which would have been better avoided: Bell CCA NSW 31 May 1985 (although it may be noted that was a case decided in the context of the now repealed S 407 of the Crimes Act). 
    151   Moreover, it seems to me the directions given at this point fell into error so far as reasons were offered for the absence of a denial or explanation, none of which found support in the evidence. To have offered the specific reasons identified in this passage may have headed off other legitimate possibilities, including those which had been identified by his Honour, namely the possibility that the appellant would have wished to avoid cross examination because he was covering up for his sister or was guilty of some other offence. The proper direction would have been to advise the jury that there may be reasons why the appellant took the course he did, as to which they should not speculate. 
    152   Accordingly, even if the case were properly the subject of a Weissensteiner direction, concerning the selected matters, I would be of the view that the directions were confusing and deficient to the point where there was a risk of a miscarriage of justice. 
    153   Independently of these matters, I am not persuaded, upon the state of the law as it now has been declared by the High Court in RPS (2000) 168 ALR 729, and as it had been earlier declared by the Court of Criminal Appeal in OGD (1997) 45 NSWLR 744, and Bargwanna CCA NSW 15 June 1998 unreported, ie in the light of the special need for caution that had been noted by Gleeson CJ in OGD (at 752), that this was a case which was appropriate for a Weissensteiner direction.  
    154   Although RPS was a case which turned upon the proviso to S 20(2) of the Evidence Act, it is evident from para 22 of the joint judgment of Gaudron ACJ and Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ, that the striking down of the directions that had been given at trial, in that case, rested also upon “fundamental principles of the common law”, that were independent of S 20. 
    155   In their joint judgment attention was drawn to the mode of reasoning which had been identified in Burdett (1820) 4 B & Ald 95 (106 ER 873) and described by Windeyer J, in Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 321, as “plain commonsense”. In relation to this their Honours observed (paras 25-28): 
     
      
       
       “25. It is necessary to keep at the forefront of consideration that the mode of reasoning which is described proceeds from the premise that the person who has not given evidence not only  
       could 
        shed light on the subject but also  
       would 
        ordinarily be expected to do so. That premise reflects a view of the kind held by Bentham that ‘between delinquency on the one hand, and silence under inquiry on the other, there is a manifest connection; a connection too natural not to be constant and inseparable’. (Bowring  
       The Works of Jeremy Bentham 
        (1838-1843) Vol 7 at 446) This view may now be open to some doubt or challenge, for example, in cases where someone of little confidence or experience is suddenly confronted by an accusation made by a person in authority. (Bagaric “The Diminishing ‘Right’ of Silence” 1997) 19  
       Sydney Law Review 
        366 at381-382) It is, however, not necessary to examine in this case whether the premise is an accurate reflection of human behaviour in some or all circumstances. 
       
      
      
       
       26. In a civil trial there will very often be a reasonable expectation that a party would give or call relevant evidence. It will, therefore, be open in such a case to conclude that the failure of a party (or someone in that party’s camp) to give evidence leads rationally to an inference that the evidence of that party or witness would not help the party’s case ( 
       Jones v Dunkel 
        (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 321 per Windeyer J, and that ( 
       Jones v Dunkel 
        at 312 per Menzies J): 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         ‘where an inference is open from facts proved by direct evidence and the question is whether it should be drawn the circumstance that the defendant disputing it might have proved the contrary had he chosen to give evidence is properly to be taken into account as a circumstance in favour of drawing the inference.’ 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       27. By contrast, however, it will seldom, if ever, be reasonable to conclude that an accused in a criminal trial would be expected to give evidence. The most that can be said in criminal matters is that there are some cases in which evidence (or an explanation) contradicting an  
       apparently damning inference to be drawn from proven facts 
        could come only from the accused. In the absence of such evidence or explanation, the jury may more readily draw the conclusion which the prosecution seeks. As was said in  
       Weissensteiner v The Queen 
        (1993) 178 CLR 217 at 227-228 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ) 
       : 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         ‘In a criminal trial, hypotheses consistent with innocence may cease to be rational or reasonable in the absence of evidence to support them  
         when that evidence, if it exists at all, must be within the knowledge of the accused.’ 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       28. In a criminal trial, not only is an accused person not bound to give evidence, it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The observations by the Court in  
       Jones v Dunkel 
        must not be applied in criminal cases without taking account of those considerations.” 
       
      
    156   It was made clear by the joint judgment that the premise for the direction, namely that it may be “reasonable … to expect some denial or contradiction to be forthcoming from the (appellant) if such a denial or contradiction is available” was wrong, and was contradictory to the “fundamental features of a criminal trial” (paras 32 to 34). In particular, it was noted there are many reasons, some cogent and some not, why an accused may not wish to give evidence, including the assessment that the evidence adduced by the prosecution does not prove the offence to the requisite standard. 
    157   Their Honours distinguished such a case from that considered in Weissensteiner, where guilt of the accused was to be inferred from the unexplained disappearance of the victims from their boat on a voyage which they had commenced with him, and from his possession of their boat and equipment. In those special circumstances, it was held that there was no error in a direction that the jury could more safely draw the inference invited by the prosecution “when the accused elects not to give evidence of relevant facts which can be easily perceived to be in his knowledge” (at 224).  
    158   Their Honours noted that Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ had pointed out in Weissensteiner (at 228): 
     
      
       
       “Not every case calls for explanation or contradiction in the form of evidence from the accused. There may be no facts peculiarly within the accused’s knowledge. Even if there are facts peculiarly within the accused’s knowledge the deficiencies in the prosecution case may be sufficient to account for the accused remaining silent and relying upon the burden of proof cast upon the prosecution. Much depends upon the circumstances of the particular case and a jury should not be invited to take into account the failure of the accused to give evidence unless that failure is clearly capable of assisting them in the evaluation of the evidence before them.” 
       
      
    159   It remains possibly open to argument that a Weissensteiner direction should only ever be contemplated in a “smoking gun” case, or to a circumstantial case dependent on inference from proved facts, the innocent explanation for which might only reasonably lie in the mouth of the appellant. Whether that be correct or not it is difficult to see how the joint judgment would authorise such a direction in relation to the failure of an accused to answer, on oath, the testimony of a prosecution witness as to the specific facts, from which an inference is drawn. 
    160   So far as the decision in RPS turned upon considerations other than those related to the prohibition in S 20(2) of the Evidence Act, Callinan J, said (at para 111) in a passage which leaves little, if any life, in the Weissensteiner direction: 
     
      
       
       “There is no doubt that a direction in accordance with  
       Jones v Dunkel 
        may be given in respect of a failure by the Crown to call a material witness without acceptable and admissible explanation. The need for such a direction will usually be heightened by the Crown’s responsibility to present its case in a way which is fair to an accused. (see  
       R v Apostilides 
        (1984) 154 CLR 563) However, such a direction may not be given in relation to an accused person or an accused person’s witnesses who, if the matter were a civil trial, might be expected to be called. A direction with respect to a defence case, based upon  
       Jones v Dunkel 
        would not only infringe s 20(2) but also would erode the basic principle of the presumption of innocence. The principles stated in  
       Jones v Dunkel 
        by their very nature presuppose that there is a need, or an occasion, for evidence to be called by a party, or an expectation that evidence could and should be called by a party.  
       An accused person in criminal proceedings labours under no such need, occasion or expectation.” 
       
      
    161   The conclusion of McHugh J concerning the permissibility of a jury being entitled, but not bound, to take into consideration that the accused has given no evidence denying or explaining a fact which is within his or her knowledge and which reasonably calls for an answer (at para 50), did not find favour with the other members of the Court, as a general proposition. 
    162   Similarly, his Honour’s observations that the existence of tactical reasons for not denying or explaining facts, provided an insufficient basis for a direction negating the significance of silence (at para 57), or that the “good reasons” for such a direction were likely to be few, were not ones which found favour with the remaining members of the Court. 
    163   In my view, it follows from the reasons of Gaudron ACJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ and from the separate reasons of Callinan J, that his Honour was in error in regarding the case as appropriate for a Weissensteiner direction. The occasion for such a direction in my view must hereafter be confined to an exceptional case of the kind there involved, where the line of reasoning in question is compelling. 
    164   The present case was not to my assessment of that kind, particularly having regard to the circumstances that answers had been provided by the appellant in relation to at least some of the matters in his unsworn statement, that as to others his evidence could not have risen above a denial, and that tactical reasons were apparent to all as to why the appellant may have wished not to give evidence that were unassociated with fear of incriminating himself for the offence of murder for which he was on trial. 
     
      
     Unsafe and unsatisfactory verdict 
      
    165   In summary, it was put that the jury had obvious difficulty, as had the jury at the first trial, in coming to a decision. In each trial the verdict was returned after several days of deliberation, and after a number of questions had been asked by the jury. Otherwise the submission turned upon the time that had elapsed since the killing, the inability of the Crown to positively link any of the firearms, that had been identified as having been in the possession of the appellant, to the projectile or projectiles which caused the death of the deceased, the fact that the Crown relied to some extent on evidence adduced through cross examination of its own witnesses, pursuant to leave given under S 38 of the Evidence Act, and the fact that a number of witnesses appeared either to have had an interest to serve, or to have given inconsistent versions. 
    166   To some extent these matters overlap with the other grounds of appeal dealt with above. It was, however, fairly conceded by Counsel, on the appeal, that it could not be said that the verdict was one that could not be supported on the evidence received, even if that of Vikki Climpson and Bradley Walsh were to be ignored. 
    167   Upon my assessment of the evidence there was in fact a strong circumstantial case, despite the unusual circumstances relating to the nocturnal activities of the deceased, and relating to whatever it was that caused him to carry arms. It could not be said, in my view, that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt, so as to support a quashing of the conviction and the entry of a verdict of acquittal, in accordance with S 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, as that provision has been explained in Fleming (1998) 158 ALR 379 and Giam (1999) NSW CCA 53. The case is however, suitable for a new trial, by reason of the errors otherwise shown to have occurred. 
     
      
      
     CONCLUSION 
      
    168   Having regard to the Weissensteiner direction, and the manner in which lies were dealt with, the case is one where there was in my view a miscarriage of justice such as to attract S 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
    169   The orders I would propose accordingly, are: 
     
      
     1. Appeal allowed 
      
      
     2. Conviction and sentence quashed 
      
      
     3. New trial ordered.

    172   The faults adverted to by Wood CJ at CL in the terms of the Weissensteiner direction made by the trial judge and in His Honour’s directions concerning lies are sufficient to persuade me that there has been a miscarriage of justice.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
        
       
      
     1     
     GROVE J : 
       
      There is before the Court an appeal pursuant to s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. Leave is not required to the appellant as it is accompanied by a certificate by the Honourable Justice Hidden. That certificate does not raise a question for decision by this Court in the clearest of terms and it is desirable to state a little background. 
      
       
      
     2     
     His Honour is presently presiding over a trial of multiple accused, one of whom is Satuala Nanai, the present appellant. The appellant has been on bail pending his trial and it is common ground that in the course of trial his bail has been continued during adjournments, including weekends and days when the court is not sitting. An application was made to his Honour arising out of the circumstance that the appellant's employment was in danger of being terminated as a result of the necessity that he interrupt it for the purpose of attending his trial.  
      
       
      
     3     
     Certain material was put before his Honour in connection with commitments of the appellant to his wife and daughter and to the mortgagee of their home. It can be commented that the circumstances were viewed sympathetically by the learned trial judge and by counsel appearing for the Crown. 
      
       
      
     4     
     His Honour treated the application as an application for bail during the course of the hearing or, alternatively, an application to dispense with bail. 
      
       
      
     5     
     The material before this Court shows clearly that his Honour declined to accept the suggestion that bail should be dispensed with and Mr Horler QC has fairly acknowledged on behalf of the appellant that the issue of dispensing with bail is not available for debate in these proceedings. What is left, therefore, is the refusal of his Honour to make a bail order in terms which would permit the appellant not to be present during the hearing of the trial, or at least, substantial parts of it.  
      
       
      
     6     
     Mr Horler has suggested that the bail order is an interlocutory order and that it is competent for this Court to entertain the appeal within the jurisdiction vested by s5F.  
      
       
      
     7     
     When dealing with the matter below Hidden J observed that the Bail Act itself, which is declared to be comprehensive of the law of bail in this State, was silent on the issue of power to make an order such as was sought. 
      
       
      
     8     
     Be that as it may, a preliminary question arises as to the competence of this appeal. The certificate removes the requirement for leave to be granted but, as Mr Horler properly acknowledged, that does not remove from the necessity for decision upon the issue of competence.  
      
       
      
     9     
     Section 5F in its terms declares that it applies to proceedings, including committal proceedings, for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court or in the District Court and in proceedings under s51A of the Justices Act. 
      
       
      
     10     
     Although his Honour's certificate is not expressed in these precise terms the question arises as to whether a bail decision granting or refusing bail is a matter which is within the scope of the grant of jurisdiction by s5F. Some assistance can be gleaned from the case of  
     R v Serratore 
      (1995) 81 Aust Crim R 363 where the Court was dealing with an issue involving both the Bail Act and the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 (Commonwealth). The latter statute contained provisions concerning the subject matter of the legislation, in particular providing that a person may give privately obtained information in evidence in an exempt proceeding.  
      
       
      
     11     
     What is of assistance in the present case is the definition of ""exempt proceeding"" which is given by s5B of the Act and provides: 
      
       
        
         
         ""A reference in this Act to an exempt proceeding is a reference to (a) a proceeding by way of a prosecution for a prescribed offence."" 
         
        
       
       
        
       It can readily be observed that, although not identical, there is considerable comparison to be had between that expression and the expression which I have noted in s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. Concerning the expression in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act and the Bail Act Kirby P. as he then was, made these observations: 
        
         
         ""An application for bail could not, in the ordinary use of that word of the English language, be classified as a proceeding by way of a prosecution for a prescribed offence. It is connected to such a proceeding. It is adjunct to it. It arises out of it. It is related to it, but it is not such a proceeding."" 
         
        
        
       His Honour added: 
        
         
         ""Nor is an application for bail a proceeding by way of a prosecution."" 
         
        
       
      
     12     
     In the same case Santow J reached a similar conclusion for reasons which he expressed which are not inconsistent with the views of the President that I have recited.  
      
       
      
     13     
     I am of the view that an application for bail, whether successful or otherwise, including an application for bail variation, cannot fall within the prescription of words used in s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. It follows, therefore, that this appeal is incompetent. I would propose, therefore, that the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
      
     14     
     JAMES J: I agree. 
      
       
      
     15     
     BELL J: I also agree. 
      
       
      
     16     
     GROVE J: The order of the Court, therefore, will be that the appeal is dismissed.

      REGINA v. MATALENA AMETE 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: The accused, Matalena Amete, stands charged that on or about 17 June 1999 at Revesby she did feloniously slay her son Samani Amete. She is also charged that at that time and place she assaulted her daughter Deborah Amete occasioning actual bodily harm to her, assaulted her daughter Melissa, assaulted her son Simon and assaulted her daughter Josephine. An indictment to that effect was presented today. To each of those matters before me today she has pleaded not guilty upon her arraignment but has qualified that plea, in each and every case, in that she has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental illness. 
    2   She had, in accordance with s.32(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, on the charge of manslaughter, on which she had been originally indicted, that is, on the first count in the present indictment, elected to be tried by a judge alone. As I understand that election, and the course that the Crown and the defence seek, I take the election will apply to all the offences on which she is now indicted. Would you confirm that, please, Madam Crown? 
     
      
     CROWN PROSECUTOR: I do your Honour. 
      
      
     HIS HONOUR: For the defence? 
      
      
     EVERS: Yes, your Honour. 
      
    3   HIS HONOUR: It is accepted that she had complied with the formalities under the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and the requisite notice provided. 
    4   This is a matter that is plainly apposite for trial by judge alone raising as it does that question common to all counts of whether or not she is mentally responsible for her acts such that she might have the defence of mental illness in the tragic circumstances of this case. 
    5   When the matter came before me, the facts were opened shortly by the learned Crown Prosecutor, and I was informed by both counsel that the facts were not only not in dispute but were accepted by both parties as they were opened to me by the learned Crown Prosecutor. No question, I was informed, arose in respect of the accused's fitness to plead or fitness to elect for trial by judge alone. 
    6   In addition, there was provided to me by the learned Crown Prosecutor, as part of the material Exhibit A, various psychiatric reports obtained both by the Crown and by the defence. Those reports were to the one effect. That is, that at the time of the acts constituting the crimes charged, the accused was suffering from a defect of reason occasioned, in her case, by psychotic mental illness, so that she was not in law responsible for her actions. 
    7   In those circumstances, both the Crown and the defence were of the view that the appropriate verdict to be found was the special verdict pursuant to s.38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. That section provides that if in an indictment or information an act or omission is charged against a person as an offence and it is given on evidence in the trial of the person for the offence that the person was mentally ill so as not to be responsible according to law for his or her act at the time the act was done or the omission made, then if it appears to the jury, before which the person is tried, that the person did the act or made the omission charged but was mentally ill at the time the person did or made the same, the jury must return the special verdict that the person is not guilty by reason of mental illness. 
    8   The task I am charged with performing on a trial by judge alone, satisfied as I am with the election and that the accused before making the election sought and received advice in relation to the election from her solicitor, is that pursuant to s.17 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, to consider and make any finding that could have been made by the jury on the question of guilt of the accused person including in my judgment referring to the principles of law applied by me and the findings of fact upon which I rely for the verdict. I will take into account the warnings to which s.17(3) applies. 
    9   In that regard, the Crown tendered before me, and it has been marked Exhibit A, not only the psychiatric reports but also extensive written statement material comprising, by way of categories of statements, (i) by victims and principal witnesses to the offences including statements by the accused's children in written form and as transcribed from electronically recorded interviews with the police; (ii) in addition, there were statements by witnesses to the surrounding events; (iii) to the history of the accused and the various admissions made by her; (iv) statements by witnesses as to the movements of the accused and those accompanying her; and (v) as to the finding of the body of the deceased. Further statements and a transcript of the electronically recorded interview of the accused were provided from the arresting and interviewing police, interpreter and further statements from scientific and medical witnesses including the autopsy report of the pathologist who conducted the post mortem. There was further evidence, in written form, of the identification of the deceased. 
    10   I have also been provided with a photograph marked Exhibit B showing the location of the body of the deceased at the rear of the house. That photograph quite graphically displays the circumstances of abandonment of that body. 
    11   In the report of Dr. Patfield, dated 18 November 1999, there is set out, in very considerable detail, the circumstances of the offences. Further there has been precise reference in that report to the accused's past psychiatric and medical history. Annexed to the report are detailed analyses of the police interviews with the accused and certain of the statements of the victims and witnesses for the purpose of the diagnosis of the accused. That material is of great value. 
    12   In the light of the material opened to me by the Crown by way of summary, which is agreed to and accepted by the defence, it is not necessary for me in this judgment to recite the detail to which Dr. Patfield had reference, particularly because the diagnosis to which he came was a diagnosis unanimously shared by the psychiatrists and which diagnosis has been supported by the reaction of the accused subsequently to the treatment especially adopted for the treatment of a psychosis being one of the schizophrenia illnesses. 
    13   It was the Crown case that on 17 June 1999, the accused drowned her three year old son when she attempted, as she saw it, to rid him of evil or exorcise the devil from him by pouring water into his mouth and standing on him.  
    14   That offence and the offences alleged against her that day against the other children, I was informed, occurred in the context of attempts being made by the accused in a violent episode of bizarre religiosity to rid her children of what she believed, in her delusional state, was their possession by the devil. She had begun to exhibit bizarre behaviour in this episode in her life on 14 June 1999 and was observed by members of her church and her children to have exhibited that behaviour publicly during a church service and, in addition, exhibited that behaviour in contact with her relatives. 
    15   On 16 June, in particular, the daughter, Melissa, observed her mother to be acting strangely. She appeared to be convulsing and exhibiting glossolalia during the church service. It was sought to relieve her strange behaviour by resort to a faith healer to whose home she went and returned to her children the following morning. 
    16   It was that day in a relatives' home in Revesby that she, with the assistance of others, sought to force into her children large quantities of water while standing upon them for the purpose of casting out evil of the devil, as I have said, and she did this while making utterances concerning the children being covered by the blood of Jesus. It was in this process she occasioned scratches to the face, bruising to the body and petechial haemorrhage to the eyes of certain of her children leading to the charges that she presently faces. 
    17   At the conclusion of the initial occasions during which she sought to treat the children in this fashion, she formed the view, following her son yelling at her, that the devil remained in him. It was as a consequence of that that she renewed, in the case of that child, the attempt to cast out devils by water, which in his case caused death. 
    18   Following the culminating exorcism and during the succeeding morning, she apparently attempted to revive or resurrect the child. It is not at all clear and understandably not clear, considering her mental condition, what it was that she thought had occurred or what it was that she thought had happened to the child. She tried to warm him. She took his body and with others drove back to the family home and then again back to the relatives' home. In due course, her child Deborah contacted the ambulance, and it was through that contact that the body was found and she was apprehended.  
    19   The Crown conceded that her speech and conduct with the police were consistent with the mental disorder to which the psychiatrists referred. Dr. Patfield concludes that she killed her child in the belief he was possessed of the devil in attempts to exorcise him, having earlier made similar attempts to exorcise the devil from her other children; that she was suffering from a psychiatric process characterised by voices commanding her to do some, at least, of these things and had been so suffering, with that suffering growing progressively worse, for at least a few days if not weeks prior to these events; that she was, at the time of these events, suffering from a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind such that she did not know that what she was doing was wrong and was labouring under the delusional belief that her son was possessed of the devil.  
    20   Dr. Patfield points out that she believed at the time that what she was doing was right and did what she did with intent to save her son and her family from the evil one. 
    21   Dr. Lucas, in a report obtained for the defence, having obtained a similar history and having referred similarly to what the accused had said, diagnosed her as suffering from an acute episode of schizophrenia. He referred to two previous episodes of psychosis she had suffered and referred to the delusional beliefs she had manifested on this occasion.  
    22   He concluded that due to her psychosis she may not have had a full appreciation of the danger in which her acts of exorcism placed her son and that because of her disease of the mind she was not able to reason with a moderate degree of sense and composure about the wrongness of her actions. 
    23   He too refers to her auditory hallucinations of a command type. 
    24   Dr. Westmore, in his report of 27 April 2000, concludes that she was suffering from a psychotic illness, which the history suggests had developed in the days or weeks before the incident characterised by hallucinations and delusions, which illness would have totally deprived her of her capacity to know that she ought not do the act or, indeed, that the act was wrong. He says, ""She was delusionally driven"". 
    25   Dr. Patfield, in his valuable report, referred also to her progress since admission to a secure medical unit and his report of 18 November 1999 indicates a degree of progress to which Dr. Barclay in his report also refers. He refers to the treatment with anti-psychotic medication and the development of insight. In particular, he refers to the medical regime to a great extent relieving the delusional and hallucinatory symptomatology of the disease. 
    26   Dr. Horne, in a further report from the same unit, that is the Bunya Medium Secure Unit, has reviewed the progress since admission noting a significant improvement in the accused's mental state and the resolution of her acute psychotic symptoms in consequence of treatment with anti-psychotic medication. That report, in some detail, deals with the circumstances under which the accused is detained in the Bunya Unit and the provision made there for her treatment, including that made for her re-integration with her family and for future management. 
    27   That report recommends that the accused, in the event that the order is made under the Mental Health legislation, be returned to the Medium Security Forensic Unit of the Cumberland Hospital, that is, the Bunya Unit where she is currently a patient and, in particular, sets out in some detail the rehabilitation and treatment regimen there proposed. The report indicates a possible good prognosis, now the matter is under treatment. 
    28   It is in that context that I come to perform the function required of me sitting as a judge alone dealing with this matter pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act.  
    29   Having regard to the whole of the material, I conclude that it has been established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused by an unlawful and dangerous act caused the death of her son, as charged in the manslaughter count. I am also satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, in respect of each of the counts of assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, that the elements of each of those offences has been made out and accept what has been put to me as the underlying factual material put forward by the Crown and accepted by the defence as representing the summation of the written material provided to me on which I base those findings. 
    30   I accept that at the time of the acts of the accused, to which I have referred, she was suffering from the mental condition as is set out in the unchallenged views of the psychiatrists supported by the whole of the evidence. 
    31   I am satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, therefore, all of the matters that, except for the mental illness defence, I would have to be satisfied of to constitute the crimes charged, but I am satisfied to the requisite extent that at the time of the acts causing death the accused was suffering from mental illness so as to not be responsible, according to law, for her actions. That is to say, she was labouring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind either as not to know the nature and quality of her acts or insofar and if so did then that she did not know that what she was doing was wrong in that she was unable to reason about the wrongness of those acts in her delusional state with a moderate degree of sense and composure. 
    32   I am thus satisfied of the matters which would require the special verdict provided for by s.38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, that is that she is, in respect of each count, to be found not guilty by reason of mental illness and in respect of each count, I return that verdict. 
    33   In doing so, I have regard to the effect and consequences of that verdict as is referred to in s.39 and have provided to myself the explanation provided by s.37 and, in particular, the explanation that I will refer to later in this judgment when explaining the consequences of the verdict to the accused. 
    34   In reaching my verdicts, the relevant tests that I have applied are set out in my judgment in Regina v. Gillette [1999] NSWSC 115. They also appeared in the decision of Hidden,. J. in Regina v. Maxwell [1999] NSWSC 281, and that of Newman, J. in Regina v. Gavranovic [1999] NSWSC 205, to which I have referred in my decision Regina v. Noyes [1999] NSWSC 397. 
    35   The matters to which I have referred by way of effect and consequences and all the relevant principles are set out at length in those decisions and particularly in the judgment in Gavranovic (supra). 
    36   As required by the legislation, I make the order required by s.39 of The Mental Health Criminal Procedure Act 1990, that is that Mrs. Amete be detained in such place and in such manner as the court thinks fit, in this case the Bunya Unit of Cumberland Hospital and, thereafter, in such place as is determined in accordance with law until released by due process of law. 
    37   Matalena Amete, I order that you be detained at the Bunya Unit of Cumberland Hospital and, thereafter, in such place as determined according to law until you are released by due process of law. 
    38   I am, finally, obliged to explain to you and to the public generally the legal and practical consequences of the findings and the verdicts that I have just delivered. It is to this explanation that I had regard in accordance with the legislation when reaching my verdicts. 
    39   Mrs. Amete, you will not return to the community but will be detained in a place, which one may assume will be a psychiatric hospital, gazetted under the Mental Health Act 1990. Initially, that place will be the Bunya Unit where you are presently detained. Whilst detained you will come under the supervision of a body known as the Mental Health Review Tribunal. It comprises a President or Deputy President, who has qualifications as a barrister or solicitor and two other members, one of whom must be a psychiatrist and the other of whom must be a person having considerable qualifications and experience to serve on that body. 
    40   Within 14 days after these verdicts, the Tribunal will commence a review of your case. At the conclusion of the review, it may make a recommendation to the Minister for Health. The recommendation could be either unconditional or subject to conditions as to the manner in which you should be detained thereafter and treated. If the Tribunal were satisfied, but only if it were satisfied, that neither your safety nor that of any member of the public would be seriously endangered by your release, it could make a recommendation for your release.  
    41   If it makes such a recommendation that would be considered by the Department of Health, which, in turn, would advise the Governor. The Governor, in accordance with the recommendation and advice, could either make an order for detention or for release, conditional or unconditional. The Governor could only make an order for release where the Tribunal itself had recommended release. 
    42   After that first hearing of the Tribunal, it can at any later time, and must at least once every six months, review the case. After hearing, if at a later review, it would make a recommendation to the Minister for Health as to the continued detention, care or treatment or special release conditional or unconditional. The Tribunal would not be free at any such review to make a recommendation for release unless it is satisfied that your safety and that of any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by that release. 
    43   Again, following such a review or recommendation, the matter would go to the Department of Health and the Minister would advise the Governor. Any recommendation so advised would only be carried into effect by the order of the Governor. If you were, at any time, released into the public and a breach of those conditions took place, then the Governor may order you be apprehended and detained. Such an order would follow by reason of the practical consideration that if you are released the Department of Health would maintain a watch over your case with the assistance of a community health centre, a private psychiatrist or one of the other public authorities available.  
    44   In other words, if you are released conditionally back into the community, the Department would maintain a watch over you and a breach of conditions would lead to your being apprehended and detained again. The conditions which would be applied could include such matters as living in a particular place and taking particular medication, and so forth, to ensure you are cared for and the public is protected. 
    45   The only way in which a person ceases to be a forensic patient is, for the purposes of these provisions, when they are released by the Governor or released on conditions that at some time the release becomes unconditional but that could not occur unless the Mental Health Tribunal be satisfied on the evidence available to it that neither your safety nor the safety of any other person would be seriously endangered. Therefore, it will be a matter for the Tribunal as to whether or not during the remainder of your life you should be liberated and upon what conditions that should occur. 
    46   I cannot, however, pass from this case without remarking on the terrible tragedy which has overtaken you, your children, your family and your church. The circumstances of this case reveal an appalling tragedy, and it should be apparent that the proceedings, that have been adopted here and the way in which this matter has been conducted here, reflect the appreciation by the authorities and the court of the tragic circumstances under which you and your family have suffered. 
    47   The resolution of this matter by placing the question of your liberty in the hands of a specially constituted medically qualified Tribunal was clearly the only appropriate course to adopt.********

     JUDGMENT 
     
    2   HULME J: In this matter, I have had the advantage of reading the Reasons for Judgement of Carruthers AJ and I can accordingly be brief. I agree with His Honour's reasons and conclusion in respect of grounds 3, 5 and 6. 
    3   Ground 1 was that ""the evidence was incapable of establishing against the Appellant(s) the conspiracy alleged by the Crown"". 
    4   The evidence to which the Crown drew the Court's attention in response to this ground, and which is set out at length in the Reasons of Carruthers AJ, permits of no doubt that the Appellants and the other persons named were engaged on a large scale in activities which resulted in cannabis leaf being supplied to third parties, or as the Crown Prosecutor asserted in his opening, ""to the world at large"". However, there remains the issue whether it was open to the jury to conclude that the Appellants were party to a conspiracy with, in particular, Mr Gene Pye and Mr Jeffrey Bennett that this should occur. 
    5   In legitimate commerce, the fact that a retailer may, over a substantial period, obtain goods sold by him to the public from a producer, manufacturer or wholesaler, would not normally lead to the conclusion, even on the probabilities, let alone beyond reasonable doubt, that the parties had agreed that this should occur . Typically whilst a producer would hope and probably expect that a retailer would sell product supplied (and in turn purchase more) the producer would not concern himself sufficiently with the retailer's activities to seek to participate in an agreement that this should occur. 
    6   To take an example, I would not expect that there was a term of the contract between Woolworths and the manufacturers of breakfast cereals that Woolworths sells, that Woolworths would sell these products to the public. 
    7   I do not see any reason why a different approach is required or justified merely because the subject of the dealings is marijuana or other illegal property. 
    8   The evidence disclosed nothing as to the circumstances in which the Appellants on the one hand and Messrs Pye and Bennett on the other, became associated. It is consistent with the evidence which there was, that the Appellants, able to produce and/or in possession of marijuana for sale approached one or both of Messrs Pye and Bennett, informed them of the Appellant's capacity to supply and offered the marijuana on a continuing basis and sought no involvement on what happened thereafter. Equally there is the possibility that Messrs Pye & Bennett approached the Appellants, simply seeking supply (with some arrangement as to consideration) and again with no wider or more extensive agreement. 
    9   Thus the evidence does not seem to me to exclude as a reasonable hypothesis an expectation on the part of the Appellants that Messrs Pye & Bennett would resell the marijuana, as distinct from some agreement that they would do so. As this Court in Trudgeon (1988) 39 A Crim R 252 made clear, a mere expectation is not sufficient to constitute a conspiracy. 
    10   Although there are statements which put the matter more widely - e.g. that quoted by Gleeson CJ in Trudgeon (at p254), ""a conspiracy consists of agreeing or acting in concert to achieve an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means"" and His Honour's own reference (at p257) to ""the making of an agreement … in the sense of a manifestation of a common intention that that should occur"", I take the concept of conspiracy to require the conclusion that there was in fact an agreement - see Mulcahy v R (1868) LR 3 HL 306 at 317, 324. Peters v R (1998) 192 CLR 493 at 513, Lipohar v R (1999) 74 ALJR 282 at [42]. Of course acting in concert or manifesting a common intention is evidence from which an agreement may, depending on the circumstances of the case, be inferred but, for the reasons given, I see no requirement in the evidence in this case to infer an agreement by the Appellants that there would be ""supply to the world"" or to third parties. The case in my view is indistinguishable from Trudgeon. 
    11   In making that last statement I am not unconscious of the fact that in Trudgeon there was only one instance of supply and here there were many, nor that the relationship between the Appellants on the one hand and Messrs Pye and Bennett on the other was substantially more extensive than that between Mr Trudgeon and his supplier. However, I see nothing in that extended relationship to require the conclusion that there was a conspiracy and that all reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence on that charge had been excluded.  
    12   In that connection, I would add that I do not see in the evidence justification for the conclusion that Messrs Pye or Bennett were selling marijuana on behalf of, inter alia, the Appellants nor that the moneys paid by the former to the latter represented the proceeds of sale to the public, as distinct from the ""contract"" price as between the Appellants and Messrs Pye and Bennett. The fact that the source of the funds paid to the Appellants were the customers of Messrs Pye and Bennett, who may have been extended credit, does not mean that the payments be them amounted to proceeds of any sale by the Appellants or of a group of which they were members. 
    13   Although it is not the only reason for this conclusion, mention should be made of the fact that, following the arrest of Messrs Pye and Bennett and the seizure by the police of a deal of marijuana they then had, there were conversations between Mr Pye or his wife on the one hand and Mr Shane Jones and his wife Toni on the other wherein it was said that Mr Pye was embarrassed and trying to get as much money together as he could before seeing Shane and that Mr Pye and his wife had their house on the market because of that embarrassment - see tapes NED 1516 and NED 2012. Although one cannot exclude the possibility that the reference to ""house"" was code, my impression of the conversations is that Mr Pye was someone who owed money and was telling his creditor that he was taking what steps he could to pay. Such a situation is quite inconsistent with the proposition that the marijuana seized was that of the venturers as a group. To my mind, these conversations argue with some force for the view that Mr Pye was a purchaser, not a partner, and against the proposition that when he paid money to the Appellants, it represented the proceeds of sale.  
    14   Whether the arrangement between the Appellants and Messrs Pye and Bennett was that of supplier and purchaser rather than of what might be called joint venturers was, of course, a matter on which the Appellants could have given evidence or addressed in their unsworn statements. They took neither of these options, the tenor their unsworn statements being that they had no involvement with marijuana. The questions then arise whether an inference that they were joint venturers or, to put the matter more precisely, parties to the conspiracy alleged by the Crown can more readily, or should, be drawn. 
    15   In the circumstances I am of the view that they should not be. To advert to the distinction between supplier and purchaser on the one hand and joint venturers or co-conspirators on the other, would have involved admitting some participation in the supply of marijuana and, even if it might have helped in resisting the charge brought, provide incriminating evidence of assistance to the Crown should it bring a charge of substantive supply. There being thus a good reason for the Appellants' silence on the issue, it seems to me it would not be appropriate to use that silence to strengthen any inference adverse to them - c.f. R v OGD (1997) 45 NSWLR 744 at 752-3, RPS v R (2000) 74 ALJR 449 at [34]. 
    16   The conclusion at which I have arrived means that, as the first ground of appeal asserts, ""the evidence was incapable of establishing against the Appellant(s) the conspiracy alleged by the Crown"" and that, within s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act, ""the verdict of the jury… is unreasonable, or cannot be supported"". It follows that the appeals should be allowed. 
    17   That conclusion makes it unnecessary that that I embark upon a consideration of the other grounds. However, I should not leave the matter without expressing my disquiet at the fact that at no time in a summing up, which commenced on the afternoon of 26 May 1998 and concluded at about 10.50 on the morning of 28 May, did the judge once tell the jury that the conspiracy on which the Crown relied was for the supply of marijuana ""to the world"" whereas on a number of occasions his Honour referred to the agreement alleged as one for supply. The only occasion when there seems to have been any reference to this other element of the Crown case was when his Honour was dealing with the question of quantity and drew attention to the Crown's reliance on the amount of cannabis found in the possession of Messrs Pye and Bennett as indicating that ""over the period of the alleged conspiracy an amount was supplied to the world at large which was not less than the commercial quantity of 25"". (sic)  
    18   And his Honour's response to the jury's questions:- 
     
      
       
       ""Does knowledge of illegal activities make you part of a conspiracy? 
       
      
      
       
       Do deeds which may assist in illegal activities make you part of a conspiracy? and 
       
      
      
       
       Does knowledge of and doing deeds which assist illegal activity make you a member of a conspiracy?"" 
       
      
      
     was calculated to mislead. What his Honour said was:- 
      
      
       
       ""I give you the following direction: For participation to be established it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intended that the object of the conspiracy be achieved. The intention of an accused may be inferred by the acts and statements of that accused. There must be a meeting of minds."" 
       
      
    19   The matter was hardly rectified when, after a request by counsel that his Honour answer the jury's questions, his Honour said that the answer to the first question was ""no"" and to the second and third, ""not necessarily"". 
    20   As I have indicated, in my view the appeals should be allowed. The Appellants' convictions and the sentences imposed should be set aside. Because the reason is the inadequacy of the evidence adduced by the Crown to support the charge, there should not be an order for a new trial. Whether the Crown will choose to present further indictments charging the Appellants with substantive offences of supply - c.f. DPP v Stewart (1983) 2 AC 91, Archbold, 41st ed., para 28-27 - will be a matter for the Crown.  
    21   In the case of each Appellant, I propose the following orders:- 
     
      
       
       1. The appeal is allowed. 
       
      
      
       
     2. The Appellant's conviction and sentence are quashed.

     REGINA v Leslie Carl JONES 
      
     REGINA v Leslie Shane JONES 
     
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    22   CARRUTHERS AJ: On 4 May 1998 the above named appellants, together with Mrs Toni Ruscoe-Jones the wife of Leslie Shane Jones, and Allan John Kelly, were arraigned upon an indictment containing one count, namely: 
     
      
       
       “For that they between 15 March 1991 and 28 April 1992 at Five Day Creek and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales, did conspire together and with Neville Bruce Jones, Jeffrey James Bennett, Gene Warren Pye and others to supply a prohibited drug, namely cannabis leaf, in an amount which was not less than the commercial quantity.” 
       
      
      
     The four accused pleaded not guilty. 
      
    23   On 2 June 1998 the Jury returned verdicts of guilty against the appellants and Mrs Ruscoe-Jones. A verdict by direction had earlier been given in the case of Mr Kelly. 
    24   On 12 October 1998, the appellants were sentenced to imprisonment. In the case of Leslie Carl Jones, a minimum term of 2 years and 348 days was imposed commencing on 2 June 1998, and an additional term of 358 days commencing on 16 May 2001, and in the case of Leslie Shane Jones, a minimum term of 3 years 341 days was imposed commencing on 2 June 1998, and an additional term of 15 months 23 days commencing on 8 May 2002. There is no application for leave to appeal against sentence. Mrs Ruscoe-Jones had been sentenced earlier. Both appeals were heard together. 
    25   The grounds of appeal filed by Leslie Shane Jones are as follows: 
     
      
       
       1. The evidence was incapable of establishing against the Appellant the conspiracy alleged by the Crown. 
       
      
      
       
       2. The learned trial judge’s directions as to the elements of the offence were inadequate and misleading. 
       
      
      
       
       3. His Honour erred by failing to warn the jury not to speculate about what evidence might have been given by people who were not called as witnesses. 
       
      
      
       
      
    26   As a matter of convenience I have renumbered the grounds of appeal filed by Leslie Carl Jones: 
     
      
       
       4. His Honour erred by failing to specify the scope of the conspiracy that had to be proved. 
       
      
      
       
       5. His Honour erred by failing to warn the jury not to speculate about what evidence might have been given by people who were not called as witnesses. 
       
      
    27   During the hearing of the appeal, Leslie Carl Jones was granted leave to rely on the ground numbered 1 above. Both appellants were granted leave to rely on a further ground to the effect of the following:  
     
      
       
       6. The trial judge erred in refusing to discharge the jury after the Crown Prosecutor, in his closing address to the jury, made a submission to the effect that the accused would have been expected to call Messrs Bennett and Pye, that their failure to do so was unexplained and, therefore, the jury could infer that any evidence from these two could not assist the accused’s case. 
       
      
      
       
      
    28   Grounds numbered 2, 3, 4 and 5 were not the subject of any application for a redirection at the trial. 
    29   In opening the case, the Crown Prosecutor particularised the conspiracy as an agreement that cannabis would be distributed to the world at large. The involvement of the alleged conspirators was described as follows: The appellants were described as the senior partners; Mrs Ruscoe-Jones was said to be the central point for communications amongst the conspirators; Messrs Kelly and Neville Jones were described as persons who assisted in more of the mundane hands-on activity involved in the conspiracy; Mr Gene Pye and Mr Jeffrey Bennett were said to be the distributors of cannabis on behalf of the conspirators. The jury were asked to conclude that Pye and Bennett attended a property, “Kimberley”, to pick up stocks of cannabis, take them away for distribution, and later return the proceeds of sales primarily to Messrs Les and Shane Jones (as the appellants were respectively referred to during the trial).  
    30   The geographical hub of the conspiracy was said to be the property known as “Kimberley” at Five Day Creek, approximately 80kms west of Kempsey. Shane Jones and Ms Ruscoe-Jones lived on this property together with Allan (Ned) Kelly. 
    31   Les Jones lived at Sherwood, approximately 10kms west of Kempsey, with his wife Greta Louise Jones. 
    32   Neville Bruce Jones, who is the brother of Les Jones, lived on a property at Niangala, which is approximately 40kms south of Walcha and several hours drive from “Kimberley”. 
    33   Gene Pye lived at Terranora, west of Tweed Heads. Jeffrey Bennett (also known as Jeffrey Smith) lived at Laurieton. 
    34   The Crown Prosecutor described the Crown case as wholly circumstantial, the Crown suggesting that the conspiracy was to be inferred primarily from evidence of duly authorised intercepted telephone conversations involving the alleged conspirators.  
    35   In his opening, the Crown Prosecutor acknowledged that there was no use of the word “cannabis”, or the like, in any of the telephone calls. The jury were asked to infer that a code was used by the participants in the conversations recorded, and notwithstanding that words said to be code words included words such as “fence posts”, “ticks”, “cattle” and “drenching”, together with the fact that more than one of the alleged conspirators lived on rural properties and dealt in cattle, the Crown case was that a number of the conversations were impossible to believe if taken literally. Thus, although the above words were used at times in a genuine context, they were at other times used to mask the real subject matter, namely the cultivation and distribution of cannabis. 
    36   Evidence, other than the tape recordings of the telephone intercepts, connecting any of the alleged conspirators with cannabis fell within a relatively narrow compass. There was evidence that in February 1992 a plantation of cannabis was found by police officers growing in the Styx River State Forest, which is in the vicinity of “Kimberley”, but at no time was any cannabis found on “Kimberley” itself or on the property of Les Jones at Sherwood. Earlier, on 22 April 1991, the premises occupied by Jeffrey Bennett were searched by police and some 68kg of cannabis leaf was found. While the police were there, Gene Pye arrived. A search conducted on the following day of premises being leased by Gene Pye revealed the presence of some 22kg of cannabis leaf. Both Bennett and Pye were arrested. They were both granted bail, and according to the Crown case, thereafter actively continued their involvement in the alleged conspiracy. It is not necessary for the purposes of this appeal, to refer to other detailed evidence adduced by the Crown. 
    37   Realistically, it was conceded during the course of the appeal by counsel for both appellants that there was evidence in the prosecution case which allowed the jury to conclude that the following objects had been achieved: 
    · Les Jones cultivated cannabis.· Shane Jones cultivated cannabis.· Shane Jones supplied cannabis to Pye and Bennett.· Les Jones supplied cannabis to Pye and Bennett.· Shane Jones supplied cannabis to others, including Hulbert.· Shane Jones and Les Jones communicated with each other about the supplies that they made (either individually or collectively) to Pye and Bennett.· Les Jones assisted Shane Jones during the period that Shane Jones supplied cannabis to others including Hulbert. 
     
      
      
     The specific reference to Hulbert is not of significance. 
    38   Each of the appellants and Mrs Ruscoe-Jones made unsworn statements. Shane Jones in a lengthy statement said that he had nothing to do with conspiring to supply a large quantity of cannabis and there was no code. Les Jones, also in a lengthy statement, said that he was in Court to prove his innocence. He denied speaking in code. 
    39   Both appellants referred to various transcripts of intercepted telephone conversations with the intention of explaining to the jury that they were genuine conversations relating to rural matters.  
    40   The first, second and fourth grounds of appeal may conveniently be dealt with together. 
    41   It is helpful to note, at the outset, certain well established principles relating to an asserted conspiracy to supply a prohibited drug pursuant to the provisions of s25(2) and s26 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, 1985, as amended. 
    42   Relevantly, s25(2) provides that a person who supplies an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity is guilty of an offence. 
    43   Relevantly s26 provides that a person who conspires with another person or other persons to commit an offence [under s25(2)] is guilty of an offence and liable to the same punishment as the person would be if the person had committed the abovementioned offence. 
    44   The definition of “supply” is to be found in s3(1). It is as follows: 
     
      
       
       “Supply includes sell and distribute, and also includes agreeing to supply, or offering to supply, or keeping or having in possession for supply, or sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply, or authorising, directing, causing, suffering, permitting or attempting any of those acts or things.”  
       
      
    45   That definition, it may be noted, is identical with the definition of “supply” in the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966 (N.S.W.). 
    46   The first case to which reference should be made is the judgment of this Court in Regina v Chow. (1987) 11 NSWLR 561  
    47   In Regina v Challita (1988) 37 ACrimR 175 at 184. this Court explained the decision in Chow as follows: 
     
      
       
       “Before leaving the aspect of the case relating to the conspiracy charge and his Honour’s directions in respect thereof, we wish to make a brief observation on the decision in  
       Chow 
        (1987) 11 NSWLR 561; 30 ACrimR 103. There appears to be confusion amongst counsel as to just what that case decided. It decided no more than that where there was a would-be seller of heroin and a would-be purchaser of heroin, the agreement for sale which resulted could not be charged as conspiracy. The would-be seller could not conspire with himself and the agreement for sale between the parties could not be said to have been preceded by a conspiratorial agreement between the two parties to achieve that result. The case has no application at all to the present case.”  
       
      
    48   In Regina v Trudgeon (1988) 39 ACrimR 252. the appellant was charged with and convicted of conspiracy to supply a prohibited drug. A sale agreement between the vendor Cheung and the appellant purchaser was established, but there was no direct evidence of an intention in Cheung that the appellant would on-sell the drug. 
    49   In quashing the conviction, the Court noted that there could be little doubt that the appellant intended in acquiring the heroin from Cheung to sell it to whoever would buy it. But that is no evidence, the Court said, that he had agreed with Cheung that it should be resold - that it was part of their mutual understanding that it should be resold. It was, at most, an expectation on the part of Cheung that it would be resold by the appellant. Thus, consistently with the decision in Chow, the Crown had failed to establish a conspiracy to supply the prohibited drug. 
    50   Finally, it should be noted that in Tannous v The Queen, (1990) 64 ALJR 141 the High Court in refusing special leave to appeal, held that the decision in Chow was inapplicable to circumstances where accused persons allegedly conspired to supply a prohibited drug to another not being one of their number. 
    51   The Crown asserts that the present is such a case. 
    52   On behalf of the present appellants it was argued, in reliance upon the abovementioned line of authority, that it was not sufficient for the Crown simply to prove that Pye and Bennett sold cannabis to others. An agreement by the appellants and others to grow and/or sell cannabis to the distributors Pye and Bennett would not, it was argued, be a conspiracy to distribute cannabis “to the world at large”, as alleged. 
    53   It was argued that the telephone intercepts relied upon by the Crown were equally consistent with the conclusion that Pye and Bennett had purchased the drugs from the appellants, and then on-sold them to third parties for their own benefit, as they were with the conclusion pressed by the Crown, that Pye and Bennett sold the drugs to third parties (the world at large) on behalf of all the conspirators. 
    54   If the appellants are correct in this argument, then the appropriate conclusion would be (it was argued) that there was insufficient evidence to establish the conspiracy and the case should, therefore, have been taken away from the jury by the trial judge. No such application was made to the trial judge, but in view of the importance of the submission, this Court has received detailed submissions, by reference to the telephone intercepts, directed specifically to whether there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury to establish that, at all relevant times, Pye and Bennett were selling cannabis on behalf of the other alleged conspirators and accounting to the appellants for the proceeds.  
    55   Although the Crown has specifically relied in this Court on certain specific intercepts, it has been necessary for the members of this Court to consider each of the large number of transcripts of telephone conversations tendered at the trial. The specific transcripts relied on by the Crown on this particular issue can only be properly evaluated in the light of the evidence as a whole.  
    56   Ultimately, the Crown relied upon 17 tapes, as specifically demonstrating that the nature of the relationship between the appellants and Pye and Bennett was clearly distinguishable from the factual situation in Chow. It was submitted that these 17 tapes, in the light of all the evidence, established that the arrangement between the appellants and Pye and Bennett was characterised by the fact that the appellants received payments from Pye and Bennett as a consequence of the sale by the latter of the cannabis to third parties on behalf of the conspirators. 
    57   Rather than attempting to summarise the Crown’s submissions, it is convenient if I set out here the following extract from the Further Crown Submissions, dated 14 February 2000: 
     
      
       
       “18. There was evidence available to the jury from which they could conclude that the nature of the relationship between the Appellants, Pye and Bennett was distinguishable from that dealt with in  
       Chow 
       . There was for example, evidence that the arrangement between the Appellants and Pye was characterised by the fact that the former received payment as a consequence of the subsequent sale of the cannabis to third parties. 
        
        
       19. In  
       Ned 134 
        there is a conversation between Pye and Shane Jones in which the former says that he had organised to fix Jones up “with all them cattle tomorrow”. The Appellant’s case was that he had sold cattle to Pye. The reference to fixing him up must have been a reference to payment for cattle. In light of other conversations it was open to the jury to conclude that this was a payment for cannabis. This conversation was on 22 March 1991. 
        
        
       20. In  
       Ned 313 
        a further conversation, on 2 April 1991 Pye tells Shane Jones that he and “Jeff” will be up the next day and that Pye would drop off some money for the cattle. In a call on 6 April,  
       Ned 354 
        Pye refers to providing half the payments for the cattle. In  
       Ned 358 
        Pye tells Les Jones that he would drop something in. In a similar vein Pye tells Shane Jones in a call on 1 May,  
       Ned 791 
       , that he has “two suits of the money” for Les. In  
       Ned 1516 
        Pye requests that Shane Jones tell Les that he should not worry as he is going to put his house on the market and “fix him up”. About a week later in a conversation with Shane Jones recorded as  
       Ned 1644 
       , Pye again refers to getting rid of his house and fixing “him” up. It was reasonably open to the jury to conclude that there was a financial relationship between the Appellants and Pye in which the latter was indebted to either or both of them, at least Leslie Carl Jones. 
        
        
       21. Other aspects of the evidence strengthen the availability of that inference. It is apparent that Pye’s arrangements with the Appellants were regular. In  
       Ned 381 
       , shortly before the Appellants left for a trip overseas Pye tells Shane Jones that things have slowed slightly but that while he, Shane, was away, “we’ll take care of everything”. The “we” must have included Pye and indicates that the overall arrangement between them will be looked after. This is consistent with the existence of a mutual involvement on an enterprise rather than a situation such as that referred to in  
       Chow 
       . 
        
        
       22. Similarly in  
       Ned 397 
        Pye tells Les Jones shortly before he leaves that he would look after him. It was open to the jury to accept these comments as indicative that the enterprise was a joint one and that there was (sic) a mutual interests and benefits involved. In  
       Ned 429 
        Pye tells Toni Jones that things have slowed down “that little fraction”. In  
       Ned 492 
        Pye again tells Toni Jones that things were a little slower, but she should tell the “lads … not to worry”. This also suggests that there was a direct relationship between Pye’s activities and those of the others involved in the arrangement. Similarly, in  
       Ned 536 
        Pye again tells Toni Jones that things had been slow, but had picked up and given another week “it will be all gone”. In the same conversation he tells her that “Geoffrey” would be there in an hour with “about two and a half for youse”. It was an available inference for the jury that Pye was keeping the others informed about the volume of the business because it was relevant to them. 
        
        
       23. In  
       Ned 1360 
        Shane asks Pye how things are going. He is told that it had quietened down. Pye then says: 
        
        
         
         Yeah not bad. Not bad. Anyway mate, ah, get, ah, get amongst them, amongst the, the herd and ah, to get rid of them for ya. 
         
        
        
       In the context of other references to cattle and herds it was open to conclude that Pye was confirming that he was going to dispose of cannabis for Shane Jones.  
       
      
      
       
       24. Other examples of Pye’s involvement being greater than merely a party to an agreement to supply is evident from  
       Ned 409 
        in which he tells Toni Jones to tell Ned that there had been complaints about “a few of the cattle” and that he was going to have to clean them up. Having regard to the evidence from which the jury could infer the cattle references in this context were references to cannabis, it was also open to conclude that Pye was engaged in aspects of the cultivation of cannabis for sale. 
       
      
      
       
       25. Similarly, in  
       Ned 561 
        Bennett indicates that he has gone to where the cannabis is growing and considers the quality to be adequate although, he says later in conversation, it will take him a day or two to “clean it up”. That conversation suggests a broader level of involvement by Bennett than that of a person who had done no more than agreed to be the beneficiary of an agreement to supply. 
       
      
      
       
       26. In  
       Ned 397 
       , after telling Les Jones that he will look after him, presumably while Jones is away, Pye says that whatever he “picks” of Jones’ will be dropped off at his place. That conduct suggest direct involvement in harvesting of something. It was open to the jury to conclude that the relationship involved cannabis. It was therefore open to conclude that the relationship was one of something more than Pye just being a party to an agreement to supply. 
       
      
      
       
       27.  
       Ned 158 
        also suggests a degree of mutuality in the arrangement. It is apparent that Bennett had asked Shane Jones to supply some bathroom scales which, it appears, he had supplied.” 
       
      
    58   In the Further Submissions in Reply counsel for both appellants challenged the conclusions sought by the Crown. 
    59   I quote the following paragraphs from the Further Submissions in Reply of Mr Boulton of counsel for Les Jones, which were adopted by Mr P D Rosser QC for Shane Jones: 
     
      
       
       “3. It is not sufficient to demonstrate that the appellants received payment from Pye and Bennett as a consequence of the subsequent sale of the cannabis to third parties. The telephone conversations highlighted by the Crown in their recent submissions do no more than that. 
       
      
      
       
       4. There needs to be a particular response to several of the conversations relied upon by the Crown. In several instances the meaning of the words spoken by the participants cannot be inferred from the terms of the conversation. 
       
      
      
       
       5. It is suggested that  
       Ned 381 
        means that Pye will “take care of everything” on behalf of the appellants whilst the appellants were overseas. This meaning cannot be derived from the transcripts. The correct context for this quote is as follows: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Gene Pye: “Ah, so I want to go, I’ll probably come and see you  
         before you go 
         .” 
          
          
         Sean Jones: “That would be good mate.” 
          
          
         GP: “Yes mate, I’ll ah, just ah, there’s, it’s slowed down a little bit, just ah, oh just a fraction.” 
          
          
         SJ: “(Can’t decipher). 
          
          
         GP: “But listen don’t worry about it, go away and enjoy your holiday and …” 
          
          
         SJ: “Yeah mate.” 
          
          
         GP: “We’ll take care of everything mate.” 
          
          
         SJ: Yeah mate I’ll see you tomorrow.” 
          
          
         GP: “Yeah mate we’ll come and see ya, we’ll come and see ya before you go anyway.” 
          
          
         SJ: “Oh that would be good mate.” 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       6. The meaning to be inferred from this portion of the conversation is that Gene Pye was assuring Sean Jones that he would come and see him the next day to “take care of everything mate”, i.e. to make a payment. It does not suggest “that the overall arrangement between them will be looked after”. (Crown Submissions para 21). 
       
      
      
       
       7. Likewise, the reference in  
       Ned 397 
        to Pye telling Les Jones “We’ll look after you mate” is another assurance that Pye will pay Les Jones. 
       
      
      
       
       8.  
       Ned 409 
        does not allow an inference that Pye was engaged in aspects of the cultivation of the cannabis for sale (per para 24 of the Crown Submissions). The reference on page 3 of that transcript to cleaning up cattle and taking “loosen and sticky” out of it can be references to cannabis but cannot by itself, or in conjunction with any other tape be used to infer that Pye was taking part in the cultivation of cannabis. 
       
      
      
       
       9. Likewise  
       Ned 561 
       , is not capable of the inference that Bennett had a broader level of involvement than merely as a party to an agreement to supply (per para 24 of the Crown Submissions). The proper inference to be drawn from this conversation is that Bennett was talking to “Darryl”, a prospective purchaser, and was assuring him that Bennett had seen the cannabis and that it was of good quality.  
       
      
      
       
       10. The reference to “bathroom scales” in  
       Ned 158 
        may be bathroom scales, or maybe something else. Either way, his conversation, either singularly or in conjunction with any other conversation, is not capable of demonstrating the requisite intention that needs to be proved. 
       
      
      
       
       11. The suggestion in paragraph 28 that, during the period in which Les and Sean Jones travelled overseas Pye was to at least assist in overseeing the operation, is not supported by any references to the evidence other than the ones which have been specifically answered in those submissions.”  
       
      
    60   Mr Rosser QC added the following comments in relation to the following intercepts relied upon by the Crown: 
     
      
       
       “2. None of the calls  
       Ned 602, 603, 604, 615 or 617 
        involves either of the appellants as a party. Even if they are capable of being regarded as statements made in pursuance of the conspiracy as opposed to recitations of past events they are capable at their highest of disclosing no more than a concern on the part of Ruscoe-Jones and Kelly at the arrests. No principle of law enables that state of mind to be visited upon either of the appellants. Any such concern is in any event explicable on the basis of a fear that Pye and Bennett may disclose the source of their purchases of cannabis. 
       
      
      
       
       3. The high water mark of the Crown case is  
       Ned 381 
       . It cannot be divorced from the context that there are moneys owed from time to time by Pye and Bennett to the Jones’. This, indeed, is a matter strongly contended for by the Crown. Within that context the promise to ‘take care of everything’ is most probably a reference to making payment for cannabis purchased. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that during the absence of the appellants Pye acted in any manner consistent with the interpretation for which the Crown contends.  
       
      
      
       
       4. Whilst it is clearly open in the evidence to infer a relationship of vendors (the appellants) and purchasers (Pye and Bennett) that is not the conspiracy which went to the jury.”  
       
      
    61   Having carefully considered the totality of the intercepted telephone calls and the 17 calls specifically relied upon by the Crown with regard to this point and the submissions of the parties, I am quite satisfied that there was evidence available to the jury from which they could conclude, to the requisite standard, that Pye and Bennett were selling drugs to third parties on behalf of the conspirators as a whole. The evidence does not in my view, fall foul of the principles enunciated in Chow and Trudgeon. 
    62   By way of elaboration, having carefully considered the arguments on behalf of the appellants, may I say that I generally accept the Crown submission set out above as providing the correct interpretation of the conversations. The strength of the Crown case lies in the combined effect of the telephone conversations which, in particular, involve the activities of Pye and Bennett over the whole life of the conspiracy. It is not necessary to consider each conversation in isolation. However, it must be noted that certain conversations carry particular force. Thus the following conversations may be considered to have particular significance in the context of the evidence as a whole. 
    · In 381 (8.4.91) Pye tells Shane Jones, who is going overseas, “We’ll take care of everything mate” and “Just go away mate, I’ll organise it all while you’re away mate”. 
    · In 397, the day after 381, Pye is with Les Jones and both have a conversation with Shane Jones about access to the property in the latter’s absence. Les Jones advises Pye that [Neville Jones] “knows which paddocks they’re in” and can “round ‘em up for you”. 
    · In 409 (11.4.91) Pye tells Shane Jones’ wife to tell him that he has received some complaints about quality and that he is going to “clean a few of them cattle up a little bit” by taking “a bit of the loosen [?lucerne] and sticky out of it” and he wanted to “tell [Shane] before I did it”. 
    · In 1186 (21.5.91) Pye tells Shane Jones he has “sixty head for a bloke to have a look at in the next day or so if that’s all right”. Shane Jones agreed. 
    · In 1360 (28.5.91) Pye tells Shane Jones that he wants “about fifty head … to get rid of them for ya”. 
    · In 1516 (5.6.91) Shane Jones asks Pye if there were “any cattle left” and was told “they’ve been selling pretty fast”. 
    · In 1416 (30.5.91) Shane Jones tells Pye that he, i.e. Jones, has “sold a few of them cattle” through the stock and station agent. 
    · In the immediate aftermath of the arrests of Pye and Bennett on 23.4.91, the wives of Les and Shane Jones discussed the events (in 603, 615, 617, 621 and 736), including a conversation about “How many herd of cattle did they sell” (604). 
    63   It was further submitted by the appellants that His Honour’s directions to the jury did not go far enough in explaining to the jury that they needed to be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that the agreement which the Crown had undertaken to prove was an agreement to supply cannabis to the world at large (or at least to third parties) and that each conspirator made such an agreement and intended that the object of the conspiracy be carried out. It was submitted that His Honour should have directed the jury’s attention to the difference between such an agreement as this and a mere expectation on the part of the appellants that Messrs Pye Bennett and would supply cannabis to others. It was submitted that his Honour should have made clear that it was insufficient for the Crown simply to demonstrate that there was an agreement between the appellants on the one hand to supply cannabis to Pye and Bennett on the other. 
    64   At some stage the jurors were each provided with a copy of the indictment and early in the summing up the terms of the indictment were read. The concept of a conspiracy was explained and the elements of the charge stated. The jury were reminded that they were being asked to infer the existence of the agreement relied on by the Crown. His Honour said: at T12-13. 
     
      
       
       “I want to say to you now something about conspiracy. A conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to do an unlawful act. The nub of the offence is the agreement to engage in a common enterprise of that kind; it is the agreement. 
       
      
      
       
       In the present case I have already just read the indictment indicating what the Crown alleges is the conspiracy, namely an agreement to supply a prohibited drug, namely cannabis leaf, in an amount which was not less than the commercial quantity, and during the period mentioned. 
       
      
      
       
       In order for you to find any of the three accused here on trial guilty, the Crown must satisfy beyond reasonable doubt of the following matters. 
       
      
      
       
       One, that there was an agreement to supply a prohibited drug, namely cannabis leaf, in an amount which was not less than the commercial quantity. 
       
      
      
       
       Two, that such agreement was to do an unlawful act It seems, from the way this trial was conducted, that there is no issue that the supply of a prohibited drug, namely cannabis leaf, in an amount which was not less than the commercial quantity is an unlawful act. 
       
      
      
       
       Three, that the particular accused whose guilt you are considering - and do not forget there are three separate accused on trial here - participated in that agreement. 
       
      
      
       
       I want to say something now about what is understood by “agreement”. An agreement does not have to be reached by formal means. There does not have to be writing or even someone saying “I agree” for there to be an agreement. As you will know from your own experience of life, many agreements are made informally, and people often enter into agreements without there being any express statement to that effect between them. The form of agreement does not matter. In this area of the law, all that is necessary for there to be an agreement is for two or more persons to concur, either by words or by conduct, in a common design.”  
       
      
    65   A third particular complaint raised under the aegis of these grounds was that, in the course of responding to a note from the jury, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
       “Firstly, I direct you again on the direction I gave you on the meaning of conspiracy. In order for you to find the accused or any of the three accused in this trial guilty, the Crown must satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt of three matters in relation to each of the accused, and remembering they are three separate cases against each accused. 
       
      
      
       
       These matters are:- 
       
      
      
       
       1. That there was an agreement to supply a prohibited drug, namely, cannabis leaf in an amount which was not less than a commercial quantity. 
       
      
      
       
       2. That such agreement was to do an unlawful act, and you will remember there is no issue about that. 
       
      
      
       
       3. That the particular accused whose guilt you are considering, participated in that agreement. 
       
      
      
       
       You have asked these questions: 
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Does knowledge of illegal activities make you part of a conspiracy? 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Do deeds which may assist in illegal activities make you part of a conspiracy? 
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
         Does knowledge of and doing deeds which assist illegal activity make you a member of a conspiracy? 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       I give you the following direction: For participation to be established it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intended that the object of the conspiracy be achieved. The intention of an accused may be inferred by the acts and statements of that accused. There must be a meeting of minds.” 
       
      
    66   In summary it was submitted that the case was finally left to the jury on the basis that they could convict the appellants if they concluded that they had agreed with each other to supply cannabis to Bennett and Pye. But, it was submitted, the Crown case was more than that. In order to convict the appellants the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they were party to an agreement to distribute generally, and that they had an accompanying intention to achieve that objective.  
    67   Lest it be thought that the matter has been overlooked, it is clear that the passage last quoted from the summing up, as a statement of what is necessary to establish participation in a conspiracy, suffers, if I may respectfully say so, from a number of deficiencies. However, it is only necessary for this Court to deal with the specific points raised on the appeals 
    68   During the course of his summing up, the learned trial judge directed the jury that on the Crown case, Pye and Bennett were: 
     
      
       
       “Distributors of cannabis on behalf of the conspirators, that they attended the property at Kimberley, and that you would be asked to conclude that they attended the property to pick up stocks of cannabis, take them away for distribution and later return with the proceeds.” 
       
      
    69   The Crown case was thus succinctly and accurately stated in regard to the involvement of Pye and Bennett in the alleged conspiracy. The appellants, for their part, unequivocally denied that they had any involvement at all in the cultivation or distribution of cannabis and consequently any conspiracy. 
    70   In my opinion the directions of law which his Honour gave were adequate in the circumstances and considered as such by counsel at the trial. The only law which it is necessary for the jury to know is so much as must guide them to a decision on the real issues or issues in the case : see Alford v Magee (1951-52) 85 CLR 437 at 466.; RPS v The Queen. (2000) 74 ALJR 449  
    71   I would grant leave to the appellants under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to argue these grounds but reject each ground. 
     
      
     Grounds 3, 5 and 6 
      
    72   At the trial both appellants denied any illegal dealings with Pye and Bennett, neither of whom was called as a witness. They contended that the intercepted telephone calls between themselves and Pye and Bennett dealt genuinely with cattle and the like; further, that whenever Pye and Bennett came to their respective properties, it was for a legitimate agricultural purpose. 
    73   Regrettably, during the course of the Crown prosecutor’s closing address he made a submission, without prior notice, to the effect that the jury would have expected the appellants to have called Pye and Bennett, and their unexplained failure to do so entitled the jury to infer that their evidence would not have assisted the Crown case. Thus the Crown Prosecutor indicated that he was seeking a Jones v Dunkel, (1959) 101 CLR 298. direction in this regard. This submission was clearly inappropriate for the simple reason that on the Crown case, Pye and Bennett were co-conspirators of the appellants: see Regina v Newland (1997-1998) 98 A Crim R 455 and Regina v Taufua. (unreported, NSWCCA 205 (30.7.99)  
    74   Not surprisingly this submission attracted an application by counsel for the appellants that the jury be discharged. The applications were rejected. 
    75   His Honour dealt with the matter in his directions to the jury, as follows: 
     
      
       
       “Members of the jury, you have heard during the course of this trial evidence about, and submissions about, whether one person or the other, particularly Gene Pye and Jeff Bennett, why they have not been called. In relation to this matter, I direct you to refrain from any speculation in relation to the attendance or non-attendance, the calling or not calling, of such persons by anyone, be it the Crown or the accused, remembering that the accused - and each of them - has nothing to prove in this case, and that, in the circumstances, you should refrain from any speculation. You have heard those words “refraining from speculation” many times during this trial. You will hear them again, I can assure you, before I finish. But it is, nevertheless, necessary that I direct you that is the situation. 
       
      
      
       
       In addition to that, you have heard some evidence about what might or might not have happened to other persons who are not here today, whether they have been arrested or whatever. Those matters are not relevant to your consideration of any issue in this trial. The matters of relevance are whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of the charge in relation to each of the three accused, not what happened to somebody else…” [27.5.98 p16] 
       
      
    76   It was submitted to this Court that this direction did not go far enough in that it did not include a direction that the jury should not speculate about what evidence the witnesses might have given had they been called and to decide the case on the evidence before them. A wider direction along these lines was suggested by Gleeson CJ in Regina v Newland. (1997-1998) 98 A Crim R 455 at 462  
    77   No such re-direction was sought at the trial by the appellants’ counsel. While the wider direction may have been preferable, what was said was, in the circumstances, sufficient.  
    78   In my view, his Honour was correct in not discharging the jury when requested to do so. Although it is regrettable that the Crown Prosecutor made the submission which he did, the direction by his Honour was such as to ensure that the appellants suffered no consequential prejudice. I would reject these grounds of appeal. 
    79   The appeals should be dismissed.
